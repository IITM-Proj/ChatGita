PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Mamaivāṁśo jīva - loke [Bg. 15.7 ]. 15.7 .; Guru - kṛpā : ""The living entities in this conditional world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.""",Prabhupāda," So with this instrument he's manipulating this machine, as exactly the pilot, with so many electronics, machine, he's working the flying of the plane. Where is the difficulty to understand? And this is, body is a machine. Bhrāmayan sarva - bhū .... Bhrāmayan , wandering. The aeroplane is wandering. This machine is wandering. It is also going. Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva - sthāḥ . Sometimes up, sometimes down. Huh ? Find out this. (devotees look for verse) Same aeroplane, going up and down. Two wings, this hand, like this."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You mentioned earlier that not only we have to find out who is the speaker, but who is the proper person to hear the subject matter.",Prabhupāda," Yes. If somebody is interested to know what is the important thing, then he can understand this. And if he's animal, simply eating, sleeping, mating, what he will understand? Animal is not interested to know how the world is going on. He gets his food and sex. That's all. That is animal propensity. And as soon as he comes to the human platform, then inquisitive. ""Ke āmi , kene āmāya jāre tāpa - traya ."" Sanātana Gosvāmī.... He's not interested, ""How I shall develop my economic position?"" He has left already a very high-grade economic position. He's not interested. He's interested "" Ke āmi , kene āmāya jāre tāpa - traya . Actually what is my position? Why I am suffering in this material atmosphere?"" That is human life."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Arjuna asks also many questions.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Kārpaṇya -doṣopahata. Kārpaṇya - doṣa [Bg. 2.7 ] . ""It was my duty to understand myself, and I am thinking of my these nonsense relatives—my grandfather, my son. What is this? I know that. What I can do by thinking about them? It may be they have come to war. But suppose they would have died naturally—what could I do? So why I am perplexed with these things? I know the defect. I cannot cause their death or birth or existence. It is beyond my jurisdiction. And still, I am anxious: If I kill them, then what would happen? What would happen?"" You kill or not kill, they'll be killed, today or tomorrow. Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ [ Bg . 2.11 ] . A learned man knows that the body will be finished, the bodily action, today or tomorrow. So what is to lament after this body? Lamentation is that the person within the body, whether he's going to hell or heaven. Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti or tamo gacchanti . That is real concern. Body will be finished, today or tomorrow or after a hundred years. Who can protect it? But one should be interested with the owner of the body, where he is going, what is his next position. And that is clearly stated: adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ , ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva - sthāḥ [Bg. 14.18 ] . So you are interested to go up or down or remain in the same status. There are three status: up, down, and the same."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : General mass of people think that life is finished with this body. They're unaware of up or down...,Prabhupāda," Therefore.... Therefore, they're rascals. And for the rascals, the Bhagavad- gītā teaching is there. Learn! They are giving the stress on the body, that ""The body is finished, everything finished."" They do not know beyond the body. But the real knowledge begins, ""No, you are beyond this body."" That is real knowledge. That is the beginning of knowledge. Any other knowledge except this, that is ignorance. That is not knowledge. They are accepting ignorance as knowledge."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," That is the defect. Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so essential. They are accepting ignorance as knowledge. Darwin's theory. It is simply speculation on ignorance, and it has been taken as knowledge. Freud's philosophy is the business of the hogs and dogs, and it has been taken as philosophy. Even the hogs and dogs know how to enjoy sex life. And they are.... On account of sex life, they have written a philosophy. Is that philosophy? Tattva -jñānārtha- darśanam . Find out. The Thirteenth Chapter. Hmm? (devotees look for verse)"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Another line?,Prabhupāda," Find out amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntiḥ [Bg. 13.8 ], Thirteenth Chapter."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Tattva -jñānārtha- darśanam .,Prabhupāda," Anyathā . These rascals, they're in ajñānam , dealing with sex life, dealing with the body as their philosophy, science. Dealing with the body and dealing with sex life is the animal business, and they are passing on as philosopher, scientist. This is their position, the whole world. So how much Kṛṣṇa consciousness is important, just imagine."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The goal of knowledge is not there.,Prabhupāda," They do not know. And animals.... Therefore they are animals. What the dogs will understand? When there is one lady dog, one dozen dog will come. Smelling the best part of the body. (laughter) This is their philosophy. So Freud is that: best part of the body, he's writing philosophy."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Books and books. (laughs),Prabhupāda," Just see. This is the position. How low taste: hogs' and pigs' business, and write philosophy. His books are selling like anything. (pause)"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You mentioned, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if someone can understand that they're not this body, then immediately he should be able to understand that there's a Supersoul.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that I have already told you just now. Therefore it is very essential to understand."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So the approach used by Kṛṣṇa is essential for any person who wants to understand the Supersoul?,Prabhupāda, Hmm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Someone in material consciousness cannot understand God? So then what of all these religions, for example, Muslim and Christian religion? Generally speaking, they don't even accept the existence of soul.",Prabhupāda," Therefore they're not religion. They're cheating. This is not religion, this is cheating."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So simply they're talking about God?,Prabhupāda, Yes. What is this?
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : This is dob juice, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," No, no, no, you can keep that. Actually, there is no religion. In the name of religion, some farce is going on."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : That's a fact. You've said in the past, ""Devil citing scripture.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. They're eating meat. They have no even human sense. What is that religion? They have no even sense that ""I am cutting throat of one poor animal under my protection. If somebody cuts my throat, how much I am unhappy. And I'm doing the same business and I'm human being? How can I call myself a human being? I have no sense even of compassion."" Cats and dogs are passing on as religionists. Some hogs and pigs are going on as philosopher. And other animals is going as scientist, Darwin. They're animals only, cats and dogs. They are the leaders of the society. How you can expect any benefit from them? The leaders themselves are cats and dogs, pigs. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ [ SB 2.3.19 ] . These leaders, they are saṁstutaḥ , they are very much worshiped. By whom? Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ . By the dogs, by the pigs, by the.... śva -viḍ- varāha ..., camel, and by the ass. Because these particular names, I have explained in the Bhāgavata ... So suppose one man has become lion, and he's praised by dogs, camels, asses, and pigs. Naturally, they will praise, ""Oh, sir, you are the king."" Does it mean he's king? He's animal. So it is going on. They are electing a big animal as president. And when he begins to eat, animal, big animal, then they protest, ""Oh, now he's not proper president. Get him down, get him down."" But why you sent him? ""Because we are pigs; we have no other knowledge. We another, appoint another big pig as our president."" Everything is explained in the Vedic literature. If you can present them properly, it will act. The voters are śva -viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- khara . And the president is another big animal. That's all. This is transaction of animal kingdom. A lion is the king of some asses, pigs, dogs, and hogs. What business you can expect there? This is their real picture. One who is a human being, he's seeing that how the animals are enjoying by voting and electing president. But they are thinking, ""We are busy in a very great business. We are electing president."" (laughter) This is going on. [break] ...you say that these rascal pigs, hogs, they elected president, and this president will eat them, and they will understand what kind of president they have elected. This thing is happening in the most advanced country of USA . And what to speak of other animal kingdom. Even the topmost state at the present moment, there also is happening the same thing. And what to speak of other small states."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : If bhakti - yoga is the..., one can only understand Kṛṣṇa through bhakti - yoga , why did Kṛṣṇa bother to explain karma - yoga and jñāna - yoga through so many...",Prabhupāda," It is to be spoken to the most confidential person. ""You are My dear friend; I am talking."" Other rascals will not understand. It is especially for Arjuna , not for the common man."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ""...I am speaking to you this most confidential part of knowledge. Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.""",Prabhupāda," ""That is especial friendship and especial love; so I give you this. Keep it confidential."" This is real. Other rascals will not value this. They will protest, ""Huh? Why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa ?"""
Guru-kṛpā; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Guru - kṛpā : So what is that confidential?; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. 18.65 ] .,Prabhupāda," Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . ""So we have spoken so many other things for other rascals. But you are My friend, very intimate. I tell you, this is real fact."" So fact is fact. If you take earlier or later, that is different thing. You have to come. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. 7.19 ] . One has to take many births before coming to this understanding. Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ . So everyone is not mahātmā even, what to speak of sudurlabhaḥ . (laughs) (end)"
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : You know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that if anyone has power to induce anybody to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa , therefore they must have some special power. Therefore that's their qualification.",Prabhupāda," That special power, that is said in the śāstras. But people do not want that."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Just like, for example, in Bengal before, there was that Charan das Babaji. He induced them to chant the wrong mantra , but where is.... He's not specifically paramparā .",Prabhupāda," No. He chanted for some time and, of course, there was chanting of ""Nitāi- Gaura ."" He introduced new system of chanting: nitāi - gaura rādhe - śyāma . So the Nitāi - Gaura chanting will have some effect, Kali - yuga . Although he was presenting pervertedly, the beginning was Nitāi - Gaura , so it would have some effect. He did not know actually Nitāi - Gaura . From his words it appears. He used to preach that Nitāi is Rādhārāṇī, and Gaura is Kṛṣṇa . That is siddhānta - viruddha . But some way or other, he was chanting Nitāi - Gaura . So some effect were there. Just like sandalwood. You do not know which way better pulp comes out, but if you rub any way, some pulp will come because it is sandalwood. So he had some effect of chanting Nitāi - Gaura , but later on they deteriorated because they did not know actually, neither they were taught. Siddhānta - viruddha . The siddhānta - viruddha means it will deteriorate. It will not endure."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about, say, many of your Godbrothers? They also have disciples, and they also are properly initiated by a proper spiritual master, and they give the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra .",Prabhupāda," The thing is the spirit, real service of preaching, stopped. Formality is going on, but the real business.... Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement means āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa [Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] . That is stopped. Do you follow? The formalities is there, but the real life of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement is preaching. Otherwise why Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa . Tāra means preaching. Yāre dekha , tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa-upadeśa' [ Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] . And that is stopped. They are satisfied if they could construct one temple and beg some rice from the neighborhood: ""Sir, we have got some temple,"" that's all. They are satisfied. The spirit of preaching forward- pāpī tāpī jata chilo, hari -nāme uddhārilo —that is stopped. So by hari - nāma , by chanting, by this way, to live little peacefully in the temple and eat and sleep, that much they have got. If that is the success, that success they have got. And this was condemned by my Guru Mahārāja , that ""To earn some money by showing Deity in the temple and eat and sleep—better you become a sweeper in the street and earn your honest livelihood and live."" This is cheating. This was condemned. To construct a temple.... Just like the Vṛndāvana Gosvāmīs are doing. They thought that ""This is our business. Some innocent people will come here and offer some.... Bas, that's our good income."" According to the temple's popularity, they think, ""This is our success."" Therefore they are deteriorating. So that is not success. Success is his who is pushing forward the preaching method. That is his success. And if we think that ""By showing a temple Deity we get some money and rice and cloth and just peacefully live here. Don't bother about going to Fiji and all over..."" (laughs) That much success they have got. But that is not Caitanya Mahāprabhu . Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma , sarvatra pracāra . What they are doing for that? That is point."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : What if sometimes disciple, he may go to preach, but he's not preaching in the exact same spirit of his spiritual master?",Prabhupāda," Therefore he is not to be preached. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, janma sārthaka kari' kara para - upakāra : [Cc. Ādi 9.41 ] ""Go to do good to others. First of all you do good to yourself."" First of all you become really preacher. Then go to preach. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never sent neophyte to go to preach. For neophyte the preaching is not their business. For neophyte, one should stick to the worship of Deity in the temple. And those who have understood the philosophy, applied the philosophy in his life, he should go for preaching. Otherwise he'll preach wrongly, like.... What is that? Charan das Babaji. And it will stop. He wanted to preach, but he did not know how to preach, and therefore, after his life, it is finished. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not say like that, that ""You remain a rascal and go to preach."" No. Janma sārthaka kari . ""Your first business is that you make your life perfect. Then go to preach. Perfect means you learn how to obey My orders."" That is perfection. Āmāra ājñāya . So if you are actually, perfectly carrying out the orders of Caitanya Mahāprabhu , then you are preaching. Otherwise you will do wrongly, mislead. Don't do that. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB 7.5.31 ] . If you remain blind, don't try to lead other blind men. That is misleading. First of all open your eyes. Everything is there. Nobody can do anything whimsically. If you do whimsically, concoctedly, that will be failure. It will not be effective."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Even though one may get many followers, that is not...",Prabhupāda," Many? What you...? Many followers.... The philosophy you present, it must be followed by everyone. That is wanted. You have got, say, ten thousand followers. That does not mean success. Everyone has got some followers. This.... What is that? Guruji Maharaja . He has got also so-called followers. The T.M., he has got also some followers. Everyone has got some followers. But what kind of followers they have? That is quality. Everything has quality. Simply quantity is not. There are many Christians. Even up to date, some Christian fair or.... Many millions will come. What is the quality? Quality is all meat-eater. But Christian means he should not kill. Where is the Christian? So we have to test by the quality, followers. Not many followers, the quality of the followers. My Guru Mahārāja used to say like that, that ""If I get at least one quality disciple, then all my labor will be success."" He was saying like that: quality, not the quantity. By quantity if one is amazed, then he is also goru. By quality—what kind of followers? That is the.... From the very beginning my strictures are there, that ""You have to follow this""—quality. If I were..., ""No, you can do like Vivekananda. Yes, what you can, whatever you like,"" then I think quantity would have been very, very big. But I don't say. I make him promise before the fire, before the Deity, before guru . [break] That one moon is taken into account. Who takes account of the millions of stars? Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca tārā sahasraśaḥ . Quality. So we should be quality devotee, not quantity devotee. I have taken two glasses. Just see how nice water is, tap water. Here so many dobs are available, and this rascal is manufacturing RC and he is going as to be..., business. And for hearing Bhagavad- gītā they have no time, and they are trying to go to Vṛndāvana . Quantity, not quality. So civilization should be quality civilization, not quantity civilization. Do that. Bheḍyadāsana. Bheḍyadāsana (indistinct). Bheḍī , lamb, they are going, hundreds and thousands. They flock. So, and if one bheḍī , lamb, is somehow or other pushed into slaughterhouse stockroom, so all the.... All of them. You haven't got to take many. Some way or other, you induce one of them to go into the, what is called, shed, where stocks are kept for taking out daily and killing. So they do not mind that ""We are being pushed into this room for future killing. Never mind. One has gone. Go."" They'll go. So this is called in Hindi, bheḍyadāsana, that without any consideration, ""One has entered. Let us all enter."" That is bheḍī , means animal, their disciple like this. They liked the ceremony?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : I think we should tell.... Vāsudeva dāsa is getting his brāhmaṇa thread this afternoon?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Are you giving him his brāhmaṇa initiation this afternoon?,Prabhupāda, He has come?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : No.,Prabhupāda, We can do that tomorrow. So it has been settled where we are going?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Well, I have to go to the airport this evening.",Prabhupāda," No, with Vāsudeva ."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Yes. He is.... He thought it was best.,Prabhupāda, Don't do anything...
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : No, it was his suggestion because he doesn't want it to be another small program. He feels...",Prabhupāda, This is also cold water?
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : It was. It's still cold.,Prabhupāda," Darwin's theory is body is changing, but why it is changing, he does not explain."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : It's because of nature. You can't explain nature. That's his only answer.,Prabhupāda," Nature.... But we also say, prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. 3.27 ] . So it is to be understood that it is being done under superior control. If nature is doing, so nature is superior control. He cannot explain. So if he does not know how nature is working, then what is the value of his theory? If he says that he cannot explain how nature is doing, that means he is not expert. He may be mistaken. So why his opinion or decision should be taken final? He does not know how nature is working. That is not perfect knowledge. Does he say like that, ""Nature is working""?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Nature.,Prabhupāda," So how nature is working, he does not know. Then his knowledge is imperfect. Nature is working how, that we know. That is very sober understanding. We say that nature is working under the superintendence of Kṛṣṇa . Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram [Bg. 9.10 ]. Nature.... We see nature. Generally we have got idea of the material nature, that the sun is one of the part and parcel of nature's working. The moon is also, the seasonal changes. So many things, nature is working very systematically. The summer season will appear exactly in the month of June and July. The fall begins in September every year. One can foretell that ""Next September this will happen,"" because nature's routine is very fixed up. So this systematic work of nature, how it is possible if there is no supervision?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : What they do is they just take it for granted because it's happening so regularly.,Prabhupāda," So that means you have to accept it—there is superior administration. You may not know what is that administration, but you have to accept it. That is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā . Kṛṣṇa says, ""Under My supervision."" Here those who are in the gross ignorance, not intelligent, they can suggest that there is some brain, just like Professor Einstein used to say. But he has no knowledge who is that brain, and we have that knowledge, who is that brain. That brain is Kṛṣṇa . Therefore our knowledge is perfect. They can simply suggest that ""There is a brain,"" but we can say, ""Here is the brain."" Then it is.... If one knows whose brain it is, that is perfect knowledge."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : But they have no faith. That's the only difficulty.,Prabhupāda," That is foolishness. You accept some brain. But if somebody comes who is accepted as the brain, they have no faith. That means rascal. Nārada says, ""Here is the brain."" Brahmā says, ""Here is the brain."" Śiva says, ""Here is the brain."" Then ācāryas, Vyāsadeva, says, ""Here is the brain."" Then modern ācāryas, they say, ""Here is the brain."" Then why don't you accept? You are so rascal? Just like a person is going to London. So if he says, ""I have no faith that this Quantas will carry me to London,"" then how he will be convinced? How he'll be? If he says that ""I have no faith in this Quantas company, that it will carry me to London,"" and if he does not purchase the ticket—he has no faith—then who will be loser? The Quantas company will be loser and he will be loser. The rascal who says.... You can say that, that Quantas will carry him to London. You can say that. But if on account of this wrong faith if he does not purchase the ticket, then who will be loser? The Quantas will be loser or he will be loser? If you have no faith, then you are loser. You remain. Rot in this place. Do not try to go to London. What do you think? Eh?"
Indian man (1),The traveler is the loser.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : The traveler is the loser.,Prabhupāda," Yes, traveler is the loser. If you have no faith, then loser, you are loser. You will never understand. Therefore śāstra says, Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc. Madhya 17.186 ] . Big, big stalwart ācāryas, mahājanas, they are accepting. Therefore we accept. That is sense. And if you sit down, ""No, no, I have no faith,"" you'll sit down and remain a rascal, that's all. Ādau śraddhā . Therefore faith is the first thing. Ādau śraddhā . If he has got intelligence, he'll see: ""So many big, big.... Lord Brahmā accepts. Lord Śiva accepts. Vyāsadeva accepts. Nārada accepts. The ācāryas accept. So am I more than them? No. I will accept."" And that is perfection of.... Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc. Madhya 17.186 ] . And if still you remain faithless, then you are rascal. Same example can be.... Quantas. So many hundreds are purchasing ticket. They have also never seen London, but on faith they're purchasing ticket. So you have no faith, you don't purchase; therefore remain here. Without faith you cannot begin to work. The same example: You have gone to a barber shop. He is shaving, and people blindly, closing eyes, and he has got a razor. He can immediately cut. But why do you do this? Because you have faith that ""These people are professional barbers. They are shaving so many other people. They will not kill me. All right. Go on."" This is faith. And if you have no faith, then you will never have clean shaven. You go away. So beginning is faith, but faith should not be blind. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc. Madhya 17.186 ] . You have to take faith from great personalities. That is faith. Just like you American boys and girls. You began with faith. Without faith nothing can be.... Ādau śraddhā . Just like people come, and they get some faith that ""So many people are following Swamiji."" So he associates for some time. Then he offers himself for initiation. This is the way. Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu -saṅgo 'tha bhajana - kriyā [Cc. Madhya 23.14 -15] . And bhajana - kriyā , if he agrees with spiritual master and takes his word, then anartha - nivṛttiḥ syāt . Spiritual master says, ""You should not do this,"" and if he follows, then automatically his unnecessary burden is cleansed. This is the way. But faith is the beginning. And that is quite natural. Faith means by seeing others, respectable persons following, ""And why not I shall follow?"" That is faith. Faith is not also blind. You can see that so many others are doing, ""So why I myself?"""
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : This faith in the mundane religions, that cannot be called real faith.",Prabhupāda," No, that is faith, but because one is not intelligent, he takes irreligion as religion. He does not.... He should be also very intelligent, faithful and intelligent. Not blind faith. He must be faithful, and intelligence.... He must know what is actually religion. So therefore sādhu - saṅga [Cc. Madhya 22.83 ] . Associate with sādhus means those who are actually on the platform. So if he associates with the sādhu —the sādhus accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead—he will get the understanding that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. Then his faith becomes fixed up in Kṛṣṇa . This is the way."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : So what is the exact meaning of that verse, śraddhā - śabde . That verse...",Prabhupāda," Yes, śraddhā . That faith increase, and when it is increased so much that he fully understands, ""By worshiping Kṛṣṇa , everything is done,"" that is first-class faith. Śraddhā- śabde viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya [ Cc. Madhya 22.62 ] . If he becomes fixed up, ""Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality,"" that is first-class, means fulfillment of faith. In the beginning it might be doubtful, neophyte. But when that is, that faith is fixed up, ""Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality,"" that is the fulfillment of faith. Faith also there are different stages, improvement. Devotional service means different grades of faith. Today I am in one stage of faith, next day another stage, next day another stage, next day another stage. And when you come to the stage that vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19 ] , oh, that is final. Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ . That takes time. And quickly also, if one is fortunate. If one is intelligent—""The śāstra says, 'Vāsudeva is everything,' so why not take Vāsudeva everything?""—then he gains the result immediately. And if he thinks, ""All right, let me see for some time,"" so he may waste his time, but the point is the same. Point is the same, but he has not developed his faith to such extent. You have to wait. And intelligent person, he says, ""Why shall I wait? Let me take finally vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19 ] . That business is finished."" Sa mahātmā . Therefore it is said, sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ . That kind of staunch faith is not very easy. It is for the great personality. Immediately accepts. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] . Immediately accepts: ""Yes."" Then sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ . That is not very easily done. That means yeṣāṁ tv anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya - karmaṇām [Bg. 7.28 ] . He is completely free from all reaction of sinful life. Puṇya - karmaṇām —he is only engaged in pious activities. Yeṣāṁ tv anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānām , te dvandva - moha ... He has no more doubt. Dvandva - moha - nirmuktāḥ . He has no doubt. ""Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person."" That's it. That's all. If you take by argument, reason, you may waste your time. But if you are intelligent, you can take it on the evidence of mahājano yena gataḥ , all the mahājanas."
Devotee (2),They say that one should try to.... In order to approach the spiritual master one must...,Prabhupāda, Purchase?
Devotee (2),Approach. Approach. One must become perfect to start with. One must approach a perfect spiritual master and he must become perfect disciple. Could you explain that?,Prabhupāda, Yes. He should follow spiritual master. Then he is perfect disciple. Bring water with ice. (end)
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Can anyone be said to be innocent in this world?,Prabhupāda," There are three classes: one devotee, one innocent, and one envious. So we have nothing to do with the envious. With devotee, we shall make friendship, and to the innocent, we shall preach."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : But the innocent souls, they're not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda," He'll surrender. You teach him. Because he's innocent, he does not know. But you preach, he will become. That is our duty."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So persons who we preach to and give the message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to...,Prabhupāda," Then let.... If anyone hears very attentively, that means he's innocent. He should be given attention. And one who says, ""Why Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān ? Ramakrishna Bhagavān ."" Oh, that's rascal, immediately. Take him, rascal. That's all. Finished. Created God. Huh ? This Ramakrishna Mission has created God. God cannot be created. God is God. This is anthropomorphism. Is it not?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Right. Yes.,Prabhupāda, Zoomorphism.
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : These people that say that they are God, they should be taken to court and thrown in jail for misrepresentation.",Prabhupāda," No, that is by.... There are some.... But first of all, if somebody creates God, then he should be challenged that ""Where is your, what is your definition of God? If you were created God, corroborate with the definition. Then we accept."" This is very logical. We can ask anybody, ""What is your definition of God? What do you mean by God?"" Then he has to explain. This is the point."
Devotee,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, once you told a man, ""What is your definition of God?"" And he could not answer. And you answered him that ""God means the Supreme Being."" And you said, ""You are saying you are God, but you don't even know the definition of God. So how you are God?""",Prabhupāda," Yes. If you do not know what is God, how can you say that ""Here is God""? You cannot say. [break] One who is after God, he'll accept our philosophy. But the, those who are rogues, who want to banish God or kill God, they'll not accept. So we have to avoid such persons."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Persons who are too much sinful...,Prabhupāda, Huh ? Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...they can't give up their sinful activities even after hearing about Kṛṣṇa , are they in the envious class or the innocent class?",Prabhupāda," They're envious. Sinful means that is the cause of their becoming envious. [break] ...law. Religion means the order of God. Simple definition. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat - praṇītam [SB 6.3.19 ] . Just like law, we keep to the right or left, order of the government. One who obeys this law, he's good citizen. One who disobeys, he's rascal. Similarly, dharma means the order of God. So one who obeys the order of God, he is really religious. One who does not, he's rogue, duṣkṛtina. This is simple. [break].... Christian. Now, what is the order of God? The Ten Commandments. If one abides by the Ten Commandments, he's really Christian. Take Buddhism; if he abides by the order of Lord Buddha , then he's right. Take Muhammadans even. So it may be one is Muhammadan, one is Christian, or one is Buddhist, one is Hindu , but if he abides by the order of God, then he's religious. Otherwise bogus. We are concerned Vedic religion. Our conclusion is that to approach Lord Viṣṇu . Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ . This is Vedic, Ṛg- mantra . Or Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] . If one abides by this, then he's religious, or really religious. If he does not obey, then where is the religion? There is no religion. The instruction is here. One has to understand the philosophy from Bhagavad- gītā rightly and appreciate, himself, and preach. This is wanted."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Sometimes we hear that, from different religions, one should have faith in God. One should have faith in God.",Prabhupāda," Unless one has faith, how he'll surrender?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : But we see that persons, they speak of having faith without actually following the instruction of God.",Prabhupāda," That means he's rascal! What is the meaning of faith? If you don't surrender, where is the meaning of faith? He's a rascal. When the surrender comes? When I have got full faith—""Oh, Kṛṣṇa is God, He's saying surrender. All right, let me surrender""—that is faith. ""Yes, I have faith, but I don't surrender."" What is this nonsense?"
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : ""But we have weaknesses. Temptation is very strong.""",Prabhupāda," That is another. You strongly pray to Kṛṣṇa . Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te . Then it will be possible. And if you have got less faith, then it will..., you'll have to suffer. You'll have to suffer."
Upendra,"Upendra : We sometimes see that those who have faith in their religious process, but because in their...",Prabhupāda," But that is not faith, that is rascaldom. If you have faith, you must abide by the religious process. If you don't follow, that means you have no faith."
Upendra,"Upendra : But sometimes we meet a rare soul who does follow, but because there's no mention of Kṛṣṇa in his scripture...",Prabhupāda," No, it is not the question of Kṛṣṇa religion.... If he believes in God and the God's word is religion, so he must follow the God's law. It doesn't matter. Kṛṣṇa is another name of God. But God is the same, one, either you call Kṛṣṇa , or Govinda , or this or that. Nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija - sarva - śaktiḥ . First of all, one must be faithful to God. That you may call God or Allah, it doesn't matter. But you must know what is God and what is faith to God, what is definition of God, what do you mean by ""understand God."" These things are required."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So that must become the practice of...,Prabhupāda," Practice is no question. We have to talk with science. Practice, you have practiced something which is against religion. That should not be taken."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : It's become the fashion of world...,Prabhupāda," Fashion? Your fashion, kick on the face! No fashion! (devotees laugh) It is a science. It is not the question of fashion, a false faith, belief. These are all rascals. Science is science. Two plus two equal to four. That's all. There is no question of ""I have no faith in this. I say five!"" That will not be accepted. Two plus two equal to four. It is neither five nor three. If that truth is there, then there is faith. ""God is this, and sometimes God is this""—that is no understanding of God. You must have clear understanding of God."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : What is the quality of a person who is actually faithful?,Prabhupāda," He's accepting eagerly Bhagavad- gītā if he's really follower of God. Because there is nothing extraordinary in the Bhagavad- gītā . It is the words actually for God to speak. You may call Kṛṣṇa or otherwise, but.... Just like sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekam [Bg. 18.66 ] . This can be said by God only. Otherwise who can say that ""You give up everything; surrender unto Me""? It can be said by God only. Either you talk of Hindu or Muslim, but ask one that ""If God says, 'You surrender unto...,' will you refuse?"" Let him become Muslim or Christian. So nobody can refuse the order of God. That is faithfulness."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Śrīla Prabhupāda, why are there so many pseudo religions then?",Prabhupāda, There is no religion! This is the only religion.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Then why do they mingle at all? Why do they even get involved?,Prabhupāda," Therefore we say that one who has no faith in God, he's a rascal, miscreant."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : But they pretend.,Prabhupāda," Pretend? Kick them! Why you should accept pretension? Then you are a fool also. You say ""pretend,"" and still, you have to talk about them. That means you are also faithless. Why should you talk about the pretension? Pretension is pretension. That is faithlessness. Sometimes they pretend honest, but he's a thief. What is this philosophy? Thief is thief. That's all. [break] ...thoroughly the science of God. That is Bhagavad- gītā . The words which is spoken in the Bhagavad- gītā , that can be spoken only by God. Nobody else can speak like that. Who can say? Who has the right to say that ""You surrender unto Me""? Nobody has right. Only God can say. That is God. [break]"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Enviousness is caused by sense gratification.,Prabhupāda, Hmm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Enviousness is caused by sense gratification.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : And in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Seventh Canto, in one verse you mention that enviousness can be given up if one gives up the tendency to sense gratification.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So we see sometimes that the Māyāvādīs, they have perhaps given up the affairs of this world, but still, they remain envious, inimical towards Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda, Then?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So, how...",Prabhupāda," What he has given up? (laughter) What he has given up? You say he has given up; what he has given up? ""I have given up everything, but I remain proprietor."" What is this, given up? There is not, no ""given up."" The contradiction's there. One who has given up, what he has given up? He has not given up his personality. Then what he has given up? In Bengali it says that rasamba sataya chaibe tyāga ,(?) (indistinct) that ""In the room, whatever is there, it is yours. But I lock it, I keep the key."" (laughter) (Bengali) ""I have given up."" What you have given up? You have kept the keys. So we have to accept that he's given up? This is another foolishness. [break] So the first question will be, ""You rascal, what you have got in your possession that you are giving up? If you have something, then you can give up. What you have got, first of all tell me. You haven't got anything. Even this body is not yours. As soon as God will kick you, you have to go out. Then what is yours? You say 'I have given up.' What you can give up? Nothing is yours."" That is rascaldom: ""I have given up everything; I kept the key."" From here, for a few days we are walking. And while going, if I say, ""Now this land I give you,"" where your land? Where you possess this land? This is like that. What you can give up? What is yours? You have nothing. This is nonsense. ""I have given up."" First of all, prove what you have got. If you haven't got anything, then what is to give up? This is all nonsense. Īśāvāsyam idam sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Everything God's property. So there is no question of giving up. Because everything belongs.... I also belong to God. My body, my mind, everything is given by God. Where you get this mind? Where you get this body? It is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā : bhūmir āpaḥ analaḥ vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva , prakṛtir me aṣṭadhā . He claims, ""It is My property. What you have got? And you are also My part and parcel. So why you are...?"" This is all nonsense, that ""I give up."" What you can give up? You cannot give up, you cannot enjoy. That is your position. If you enjoy, you are a thief. And if you say, ""I have given up,"" you are a false. Therefore sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] . Somebody is thinking ""I am giving up, and now I've taken laṅgoṭā, (?)(indistinct) I have become sannyāsī . "" And whose laṅgoṭā it is? You have got still the laṅgoṭā."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The...? The...?,Prabhupāda," Laṅgoṭā means the loincloth. So what is it you have given up? And you cannot give up your body. This is made, this kṣitir ap - tejo -marud- vyoma , (indistinct) these five elements, they're also Kṛṣṇa's. You have got mind. Oh, that belongs to Kṛṣṇa . What you have got that you'll give up? You have stolen everything. You don't accept the real proprietor, and you are thinking, ""I am the proprietor."" That is your fault. That is miscreant. Stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12 ]. It is said there. Read Bhagavad- gītā carefully, that everyone is a thief. Stena eva sa ucyate . All thiefs, rogues, rascals. That is the substance. If one does not accept God, the Supreme, and does not surrender, he is miscreant, mūḍha . Mūḍha . He does not know what does he possess, and he's thinking, ""I am giving up."" What you are giving up? You do not possess anything. A mūḍha , falsely thinking that ""I am giving up."" What you have got? Nobody can give up, nobody can enjoy. This is real knowledge. Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya nitya - kṛṣṇa - dāsa : [Cc. Madhya 20.108 -109] ""I am servant of Kṛṣṇa . Everything possessed by Kṛṣṇa . So I'll simply try to offer Kṛṣṇa whatever is there for His..."" Just like nokara (indistinct), servant, in a house, he's trying to satisfy the master. But the things does not belong to him. The things belongs to the master. But if he serves very nicely, master becomes pleased, ""Oh, he is very faithful servant. Perfect."" Faithful means he knows that ""Everything belongs to master, and everything should be utilized for master's pleasure, not for my pleasure."" Then he's a thief, he's a bad servant."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Prabhupāda, what about these people that perform so-called bhakti - yoga but their aim is to merge?",Prabhupāda, Hmm? That is not bhakti - yoga . That is not bhakti - yoga . Who says that is bhakti - yoga ?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : I said ""so-called"" bhakti - yoga .",Prabhupāda," That, that is not.... Cheating! That is another cheating. (Hindi) There is the same example. ""Now I am serving the master. Just as soon as the master will be somewhere, I'll take everything."" That kind of servant. Servant serving the master, but the intention is that ""As soon as master is away, I'll take everything."" (laughter) ""I'll become Nārāyaṇa . Let me serve now Nārāyaṇa , and as soon as there is the opportunity, I shall become Nārāyaṇa ."" They are thieves, rogues, these duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ narādhamāḥ . Very faithful servant. He's planning how to usurp everything belonging to the master, and saying, ""I am very faithful servant."" Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi [Cc. Antya 20.29 , Śikṣāṣṭaka 4] . ""Life after life, let me serve You."" That's all. Never willing to become master. That is Māyāvāda . [break] ...don't want even salvation. Therefore He says, janmani janmani, ""life after life."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...go back to Godhead can be sense gratification?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is also a contaminated desire. Otherwise why Caitanya will say mama janmani , to go? Kṛṣṇa says, yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramam [Bg. 15.6 ]. If one goes to Vaikuṇṭha he does not come. But Caitanya also says He does not desire that. He is.... ""Let me remain perpetually here, but be engaged in Your service."" That is real, pure devotee. He doesn't want even promotion. That is also mentioned now: dīyamānaṁ na gṛhṇanti . Dīyamānam , even Kṛṣṇa says, ""Come immediately to Vaikuṇṭha ,"" ""Sir, that is for..."" Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja . Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered, ""Whatever you like, you take."" ""Sir, do not make me a bāniyā (indistinct)."" [break] But if anyone wants in exchange of service, then he's not a devotee, he's a bāniyā (merchant)."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Is that a merchant?,Prabhupāda," Huh ? Merchant, yes."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : So actually back to home, back to Godhead, means just back to devotional service.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Because a devotee is always in Vaikuṇṭha . Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma - bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. 14.26 ] . He is already in Vaikuṇṭha . Why he shall for that, Vaikuṇṭha ? He's not in this material world. Muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān. This is called mukti . ""The mukti ? Why shall I accept mukti ? Mukti is standing on my door: 'What shall I do, sir?' So why shall I ask for mukti ?"" [break] Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam . First make all desires zero. That is the beginning of bhakti ."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Then they say, ""Why you desire to serve Kṛṣṇa ?""",Prabhupāda," Huh ? That is not desire. It is a natural. That is natural. Obedience to Kṛṣṇa , that is my natural business. Servant's business is always ready: ""What can I do, sir?"" This is not desire. This is natural position. He's not desiring anything. He's simply ready, ""What can I do?"" Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] . That is, he's not desiring anything. Desire means when I want something for my satisfaction, that is desire. [break] ... mukha - padma - vākya , cittete koriyā aikya . He's simply expecting what spiritual master will order. Citta . Āra nā koriho... He has no other desire. That is desirelessness. [break] Desireless means a wooden stone. It has no mind, how it can de .... But every living entity has got mind, so this is desirelessness, that ""I'll wait for the order of my master and immediately execute."" That is desirelessness. .... [break] stop functioning, then what is the meaning of guru - mukha - padma - vākya , cittete koriyā aikya **? That means awaiting the order from the mouth of guru . Āra nā koriho mane . He has no other desires. That is to be under.... [break] Nirvāṇa , nirvāṇa means that you give up all material desires. Not that ""But he did not say anything more than that."" Because it was meant for the fourth-class men, so he did not say. He simply asked that you finish this material desire."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Is that not misleading?,Prabhupāda," It is not misleading. It is truth, but the truth as much as you can understand. It is not misleading because Lord Buddha knew that ""This rascal will not understand more than this."" So he did not say further knowledge."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Śrīla Prabhupāda, so some of our men, when we sell our books, sometimes we have to say things in order to get them to take the book. So that's actually not misleading.",Prabhupāda," Yes. No, that is not misleading. Let him take, some way or other. [break] Why do you think was done by Lord Buddha ? Because the atheist class, they did not believe in God: ""There is no God."" So Buddha said, ""Yes, there is no God. You are right. But what I say, you accept."" ""Yes, sir."" But he's God. Keśava dhṛta - buddha - śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare . We know that Lord Buddha is Kṛṣṇa . But he says, ""No, no, there is.... No, there is no God. Yes, you are right. But what I say, you accept."" ""Yes, sir, we shall do that."""

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Holy name? If one chants...,Prabhupāda," Ah, yes. He is mentioned in the Bhāgavata ."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Śrīla Prabhupāda, what does the word ""buddha"" mean?",Prabhupāda," Buddha means ""one who knows, in perfect awareness."" That is buddha . Buddha .

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda, you mentioned two different types of servitors. One is seeking to steal the property of the master as soon as the master is gone, and the other is sitting waiting...",Prabhupāda," He's thief; he's not servant. He's a thief. He has taken service as a matter of means that ""If I remain as a servant, I'll get the opportunity of stealing."" So he's not a servant, he's a thief. Stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12 ]. [break] ...becoming a thief, if you have got some desire, you ask, ""Kṛṣṇa, I am very poor. Please give me some money."" That you can do. That is mentioned in the Bhagavad- gītā . Ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha . Ārtaḥ, one who is distressed, he's praying. That is beginning. But when he's advanced.... Just like Dhruva Mahārāja . He'll say, svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varam ..., ""Now I'm satisfied. I don't want anything."" That is perfect stage. But even one goes to God and prays for something, he's called pious. Because he has approached God. And because he has approached God and he's asking God, there is some transaction in this way, by association of God, he'll be purified. One day he will say, svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42 ], ""Now, I am fully satisfied. I don't want anything. I don't trouble You. Let me serve You."" [break] Why the devotee will ask from God? Kṛṣṇa says, yoga - kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham , teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānām [Bg. 9.22 ] . He says the responsibility, ""I shall supply everything, whatever you want."" So why the devotee will ask? If the child knows, ""My father is there, my mother is...,"" why he shall ask? The father will take care whatever he wants. It is unfaithful that ""God cannot supply my necessities. I'll have to ask Him."" He knows everything. Why shall I ask Him? That is pure knowledge. [break]"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...circumstance there for someone who's endeavoring very hard for material necessities?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Someone who is endeavoring very hard for material necessities, is his position the same—faithless?",Prabhupāda, I do not follow.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : One who is going to...,Prabhupāda," Everyone is working hard for material benefit. So why someone? Everyone. Who is not working for material necessities? Āhāra- nidrā - bhaya -maithunaṁ ca saman... If the cats, dogs, human being, everybody is working very hard."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Say, for example, one who is engaged simply in preaching.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : One who is engaged simply in preaching.,Prabhupāda, He's serving Kṛṣṇa . He's not material necessities.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So Kṛṣṇa is supplying all facility at least to maintain body and soul together.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. I went to your country without any money. Now Kṛṣṇa has given. I went with forty rupees; now I have forty crores. Who has done this business? So if you serve Kṛṣṇa , so Kṛṣṇa will supply everything, whatever you need, require. He doesn't require to ask for it."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The question then is, is a devotee required to work very hard for material necessities?",Prabhupāda, Yes. He has to work sincerely to serve Kṛṣṇa . Then everything is there.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Even he doesn't consider material necessity?,Prabhupāda," Where is material necessity? Even for the cats and dogs, there is no material necessities. It is all supplied by Kṛṣṇa . It is simply māyā that ""I am in material necessities."" There are eight million lower species of life. Who is doing business for his...? We, simply civilized men, we are doing this. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is supplying everyone. Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān . He supplies everything. Even the ant within the hole of your room, are you giving any food?"
Devotees,No.,Prabhupāda," Then how he's living? And the elephant in the forest of Africa. Who is going to give them food? How they're living? From the elephant to the ant, He's providing, and He cannot provide you. This is all mistaken idea. You haven't got to ask. Everything is there. Because in the....

These dogs, they are not asking, going to the church for asking, ""God, give us our daily bread."" Where he is getting bread? [break] Dogs are enjoying, but they are not asking bread from God. And where they are getting? (bird chirping in background.) [break] ...how he's chirping so nicely. But he has no anxiety. He knows that ""I'll get my food anywhere. That's all right.""

Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : They're living day to day.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : They are living day to day.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is a fact. God has given everyone; you'll get your food. Therefore śāstra says, tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām ... [ SB 1.5.18 ]. ""Don't try for anything else. Simply try how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious."" That is your only business. Other things will come. If you're destined to get something, you'll get it. Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham . Just like nobody asks for distress, how it comes? You are destined to get it. Similarly, whatever happiness you are destined to..., you'll get it. Why you are busy about distress and happiness? You simply try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. (pause) Now? No."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We can walk to the end. We got here at 6:15. [break],Prabhupāda," He's giving to the human form of life, who can understand. So if we miss this opportunity, that is our misfortune. Last instruction of Bhagavad- gītā : sarva - guhyatamam , man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. 18.65 ] . He never says that ""Try for economic development."" (laughs) Man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī mām ... It is the most confidential knowledge. [break] ... Purī was chanting in a solitary place, and Kṛṣṇa came to supply him milk. Why? His determination was that ""If somebody gives me voluntarily, I shall eat. Otherwise, I am not going to ask anybody."" But he is being supplied."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Sanātana Gosvāmī also?,Prabhupāda," Yes. But for a renounced order of life, the order is you must beg, bhikṣā . Not much. If I can subsist by taking one cāpāṭi, I'll simply ask for one cāpāṭi, not for two cāpāṭis. That is śāstra . If you can without any cāpāṭi, that is very good. But you can ask as much as you require. Not to eat sumptuously and sleep twenty-four hours, no."
Devotee,And what about householders?,Prabhupāda," Householder can eat the whole world and sleep. (laughter) Because he is householder, he has got the concession. Everyone should do that. Householders are unable; that is their incapability. ""Because I am householder, I have got the facility to have sex as many times and eat as much..."" That is not householder. That is gṛhamedhī . There are two words: gṛhamedhī and gṛhastha . Gṛhastha is different from gṛhamedhī . Gṛhastha āśrama . Although he's householder, it is āśrama , only for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is gṛhastha . But gṛhamedhī cannot do that. [break] ...man has got the potency. Otherwise why they are offering...? Everyone has got the potency. We have to utilize it. Hare Kṛṣṇa . You understand English?"
Indian (indistinct),"Yes, Guruji.",Prabhupāda," Oh, thank you very much. [break] ... Bhagavad- gītā . Dharmāviruddho kāmo 'smi, ""Sex life which is not against religious principles, I am that."" Not that sex life, as soon as you like, sex. That is not gṛhastha . That is gṛhamedhī . Dharmāviruddha. Dharma - aviruddha means simply for begetting nice child you can have..., not for enjoyment. Putrārthe kriyate bhāryā . This is Vedic principle. Putraḥ - piṇḍa - prayojanam . A bhāryā , wife, is accepted only for having son. Not for any other purpose. Putraḥ - piṇḍa - prayojanam . This is material side, but still, it is religious. First education is brahmacārī , how to train him to avoid sex life. And still if he's not able, then he is allowed to become a gṛhastha , a little concession. Otherwise, the whole Vedic civilization is: how to avoid sex life. Brahmacārī —no sex life. Vānaprastha —no sex life. Sannyāsa —no sex life. Only gṛhastha , under control. That is gṛhastha . Gṛhastha does not mean one who is doing everything whimsically on account of getting this concession. He's not gṛhastha , he's gṛhamedhī . Apaśyatām ātma - tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha - medhinām [SB 2.1.2 ] . Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ , apaśyatām ātma - tattvam ... [SB 2.1.2 ] . Gṛhamedhī means he does not know what is spiritual life. That is gṛhamedhī . And gṛhastha means he knows what is spiritual life, and he lives on that status. That is gṛhastha . Gṛhamedhī's definition is.... Everything is there in the śāstra . Apaśyatām ātma - tattvam . They do not know what is the aim of life. It is like something, something like cats and dogs. They do not know. Apaśyatām ātma - tattvam [SB 2.1.2 ] . [break] So he'll speak to you. You know English, you can read books."
Fijian (indistinct),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Very good idea.... [break] ... Kṛṣṇa , and everything will be all right. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has blessed: ihā haite sarva - siddhi haibe tomāra . ""Every perfection you'll get by chanting."" That is His blessing."
Indian,(Hindi) [break],Prabhupāda, That's nice. Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Indian,(indistinct) ...he works in town council.,Prabhupāda," Oh, he's South Indian."
Indian,South Indian. (end),Prabhupāda," (tape very distorted) They are not beggar. But Kṛṣṇa has assured, yoga - kṣemaṁ vahām ... Why they should go to beg? That this is only a process to approach them. If you approach any gentleman as beggar, he'll give you, at least in India. Not.... Just to enlighten, give them education. [break] He's thinking, ""This is life."" And the sannyāsī 's duty is: ""No, not this is life. You are in darkness, mūḍha . "" That is sannyāsī 's business: to enlighten. [break] ...everything, and only for understanding future, they'll be left on the hand of the nature. Is that very good proposal? Hmm? No. There must be."
Indian man,"But they have process. They earn wealth. That's all. And no future for the child, they don't...",Prabhupāda," Because they have no education. The guru's duty is to give them education; the sannyāsī 's duty is to give.... They do not give. They say, ""Yes, you are all right. Give me some money."" That's all. That they go: ""I am avatāra , I am this, I am that,"" that's all. And he is.... He return (indistinct) to darkness. That's all. [break] ...they used to discover, whole method is finished."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : Oh, yeah. During the war.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Yes. So sinful means punishment. (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Our point is that we are going to live in the future. So if, becoming modern, we forget our future, then what is the use of becoming modernized? Better remain primitive. The business is that in future also we shall exist. If we do not know how we shall exist—either I shall exist as a cat, as a dog, or a tree, or a demigod, or as associate of Kṛṣṇa .... If I do not know.... On account of being modernized, if I remain in darkness about my future, so it is better to remain primitive. What is the use of becoming modernized and forget myself and my future? Becoming modernized, if I become dog in future, so what is the use of modernized? The real business is that I shall take care of my future. Especially in the human form of body. Cats and dogs, they do not know about future. If I know there is future, I have a future.... This is also said by Kṛṣṇa . Tathā dehāntara - prāptiḥ : [Bg. 2.13 ] ""In future."" Not this body, another body. So is it not my first business, to prepare what is my future body? That is my first business? Or to drink R.C. (Royal Crown?) my first business? Just see. By drinking R.C. if I, next life I become a dog, then what is the use of modernized life? And if we, by remaining in primitive state, we can produce Vyāsadeva, oh, it is better. But the fools have no sense. Suppose if I go to some place for some business, and going there, to select my hotel, which hotel I shall enter, I remain busy to find out the hotel, and I forget the business for which I have gone there, then am I not madman? A human life is meant for deciding his future. If we do not care for the future, and if I want to become modernized from primitive life, is that very good inclination? Real business forgotten, but I am busy with modernized life. That example I give sometimes, (Bengali). That one has to go to see a fair on account of (Bengali). So women, they generally dress themself very nicely. So the woman say to his friend that ""You dress."" So dressing, dressing, dressing.... In the meantime, the fair finished. So the modern civilization is like that. (Bengali) I have to go to see the fair, but I became so much attentive in dressing that in the meantime news came, ""The fair is finished."" That is our civilization. A human life is meant for preparing for the next life. That is sensible. But I am so much busy in manufacturing things for modernized life, R.C., T.C., P.C., and so on, so on. In future, at the time of death, I begin to bark and I think, ""Oh..."" And nature will say, ""All right, come on."" ""No, no, I'm not going to..."" No, why not? You have become modernized, barking like dog. So you bark. Who will check that? Daivī hy eṣā guṇa - mayī mama māyā ... [Bg. 7.14 ] . māyā will take consideration, ""What you have made yourself, a dog or god?"" That she will take account. If you have made yourself a dog, ""Just come on, become a dog."" If you have made yourself as god, then ""Come on, you'll be demigod."" That is for everything. Otherwise why there are varieties? There is dog life and there is demigod life, Indra life. It is not one-sided. Tathā dehāntara - prāptiḥ [Bg. 2.13 ], it is not one-sided. You have to change your body. And there are varieties of life, so it is up to you what kind of body you have got. You can change your body up to the point of becoming associate of Kṛṣṇa . Mad -yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25 ]. Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma ... [Bg. 15.6 ]. These informations are there. So if you have to prepare for the next life, why not go back to home, back to Godhead? Yad gatvā na nivartante . This is intelligent? Or to become modernized and become a dog next life? Which is intelligent? The śāstra says, ""No, this is intelligent."" What? Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam [SB 5.5.1 ] . This life should be utilized for tapasya , to purify your existence. That is the śāstra . Śāstra does not say you become modernized. What is this modernized? Simply waste of time."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Polished.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Polished dogs.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Actual modernized means how far you have advanced in spiritual consciousness. That is wanted. (drinks or eats) It does not taste exactly dahl, I think, due to the new (indistinct) water in it. So is there any engagement? Somebody was to come."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Was to come, but...",Prabhupāda, He is not coming. Who is not modernized? They will go to the dancing party for their salvation. (laughter) Dog dancing.
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Today is Sunday. Everyone is busy with their family, family, society.",Prabhupāda, You know this Ravi Shankar?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Umm hmm.,Prabhupāda," His elder brother, Udar Shankar, he became very famous man as a dancer, all over the world. Udar Shankar. And by imitating his brother, the Ravi Shankar also tried to become first-class sitarist. So family.... [break] ...was a little famous for artistic.... So that Udar Shankar was dancing in the Indian way, and there are many sculpture of dancing. Like that. That was his art. So he became famous."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : He's not living? He's dead?,Prabhupāda," No, he's dead means now he's old man. He's about my age or little older than me. Now his skin has become slackened and body is not so strong to dance. It requires exercise. Therefore he's retired, I think, maybe dead. But I don't hear his name. He was more or less known in Europe as Shankar. But he was so popular that one my doctor friend.... He was educated in London, a medical officer of Allahabad. So he told me that ""I saw that in Paris, Udar Shankar's dancing was advertised, and hundreds and thousands of people from England going to Paris, crossing the Channel to see him dance."" He showed me. He's so popular. And now nobody asks for him. (laughs)"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Another bubble.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Another bubble. I remember when Ravi Shankar and George Harrison came to see you in Vṛndāvana .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : The first thing you asked them was ""You are very famous, but what will you be next life? What is your guarantee for the next life?""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : And I don't think any other guru would have asked that.,Prabhupāda," Where is guru ? Goru, you say goru. When it is pronounced guru , I say, you say, don't say guru , but you say goru."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Goru.,Prabhupāda," Goru, no, do you know goru ? Goru means cow."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Cow. (laughs),Prabhupāda," (laughing) Otherwise they're going to find out, then don't say goru. Guru ."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Guru .,Prabhupāda," Goru means cow. Śrī- guru - caraṇa - padma . Śrī- guru . (laughs) So they're all gorus, nobody guru ."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Yes.,Prabhupāda," All rascals. Now that Ravi Shankar has become George guru . Somebody.... You were telling me? That this boy has been taught to take the dust of the feet of Ravi Shankar in the stage, and people did not like it. So he has become unpopular accepting a goru. (end)"
Siddha-svarūpa,"Siddha - svarūpa : I imagined that it would soon go on, on a mass scale, that...",Prabhupāda," No, it will go, because they are becoming more mūḍhas. There is no intelligence. Therefore I say that we are giving this intelligence. This is the only movement to make these mūḍhas intelligent. This is the only movement. Otherwise they are becoming more and more and more and more mūḍhas. So under the circumstances, if we also become mūḍhas, then who will make the other mūḍhas intelligent? That is my point. There are so many things. I'll begin this, I mean to say, recitation of Sixth Canto. There are so many nice instructions. So this... [break]...even they are kept to remain as mūḍhas, all other so-called attempts... There are many other attempts for awakening the human society to right platform, but their basic principle is wrong. They cannot do it. It is not possible. (pause) So there is no kīrtana ?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Yeah. At seven. The āratika is at seven. Ten minutes. Now it's tulasī worship.,Prabhupāda," So this movement should be pushed very vigorously. And so far, we have become successful. And enemies will be always, as soon as there is something good. That is the way of material world. Even Kṛṣṇa had enemies, what to speak of us. Eh? So many enemies, but He was powerful; He killed all them. Nobody could kill Him, but there was attempt to kill Him from the very beginning of His birth. He had so many enemies. As soon as Kaṁsa heard that his sister is now newly married, but as soon as there was some foretelling, ""Ah, you are taking care of your sister so nicely. The eighth child of this sister will kill you."" ""Oh, where is your child? Where is pregnancy?"" Nothing. He became angry. ""So why wait for eighth child? Kill my sister."" Long, long before taking birth of Kṛṣṇa , the mother was to be killed. This is the position of this material world. So he became so bad that ""My sister..."" He did not consider that ""She is my sister, and she is just newly married. Where is pregnancy? Where is child? And that is the eighth child, and what will happen after that?"" No consideration. Immediately, ""Kill him, kill her."" This is the position. So we are instructing: no intoxication. So those who are flourishing by selling cigarettes and wine and liquor, they do not... ""Immediately kill him."" Oh, yes, in this way. ""If they, the movement goes and becomes very strong, then our business will be lost. Kill him."" So naturally they will be enemies. The same thing, the Kaṁsa saw that ""This my sister, now she is married. So although it will take some long time, but here is the cause."" So they are thinking like that. No meat-eating, then all slaughterhouses will be closed: ""They're enemy."" Although there is no such symptom that slaughterhouse is going to be closed, but they'll think like that. They'll think like that, the same way. There is no ex... [break] ...pregnancy, first, second, third, then eighth, and the child will go, take birth and... They are thinking like that. So the modern civilization, we are everyone saying. Because you have forbidden: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. The whole Western world living on these four pillars. Just see our position. And the same conscious way, everyone is thinking, ""If this movement goes on, then how all these nightclubs will go on? How all breweries will go on? How all slaughterhouse will go on, cigarette factories will go on?"" This is all foolish. So you cannot expect that we will get more, many friends. That is not possible, because the world is full of Kaṁsas, demons. So we have to struggle and... In the face of so many obstacles we have come to this standard that there is one Hare Kṛṣṇa movement; it is very dangerous to the modern way of life. That much is great, advance. They're feeling the pulse. Now when they are meeting, state obstacles. Everywhere we are meeting obstacles. In Singapore."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We went to the airport.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : And practically they didn't even want to let us stay in the airport. We had to stay there only for four hours to catch the next flight. They are so much...,Prabhupāda," This is our position. Gradually they will show Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. In India also, although India's... They will want to crush down this movement. So this will be up to Him. Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's movement, the same thing. And Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed by Kaṁsa class of men and his company, the demons. So it will be there; it is already there. Don't be disappointed, because that is the meaning that it is successful. Kṛṣṇa's favor is there, because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's movement is not different, identical. So as Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed, many, many years before He appeared... At eighth child, if the mother produces child yearly, still ten years, eight years before His birth, the mother was to be attempted to be killed. So there may be attempt like that. And Lord Jesus Christ was killed. So they may kill me also."
Siddha-svarūpa,Siddha - svarūpa : I don't think that is possible.,Prabhupāda," No, I mean to say, I am not so important man. But it is the, this is the way of the law. If we become weak by factioning, then that is not good. We must be strong and... But you do not expect that this movement will be accepted. In India the so-called yogis, Rama Krishna Mission—they are also being afraid of. There are so many... But if we remain sincere, even we are feeble, new-born, nobody can kill us. That is a fact. Just like Kṛṣṇa when He was three months old, attempt was made by Putanā to kill Him, but the Putanā was killed. A big demon, gigantic, six miles long, and what is killed by a small child playing on the..., sucking breast and sucking life. That is Kṛṣṇa . So the other day I have explained that by guru , he is accepted as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You have typed it?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Go on. Yes, arcye viṣṇau śilā -dhīr guruṣu nara - matiḥ . Narakī, if anyone thinks arca - vigraha , the Deities as made of stone, made of earth, or made of something material, and guru , the spiritual master, ""He is an ordinary man""—these are forbidden. So why guru is to be considered sākṣād dharitvena samasta -śāstrair **, exactly (like) the Supreme Personality of Godhead? That reason is given there. That reason is that he is giving the Kṛṣṇa knowledge; therefore he is as good as Kṛṣṇa . Even though his family members or his friend thinking, ""Oh, he has now become guru ,"" still he should be considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That reason also given there, that even Kṛṣṇa was taken as ordinary man, but does it mean that He has become ordinary? Similarly any..., our movement, it may appear just like other movement, but because the movement is giving Kṛṣṇa , that means it is as good as Kṛṣṇa . This is the example. Ajñāya haña (follow the order). It may appear to others... And there are so many movements, and the hippies have taken another say(?), but it is not that. It is actually Kṛṣṇa . So long it adheres to the principle, ""I'll enjoy, I'll be unaccepted(?)."" Otherwise it is ordinary movement. This same man, he's guru , so long he gives the real knowledge of Kṛṣṇa . And the same man, he's ordinary man, as soon as he cannot give. Same thing, just like a stone doll, when it is worshiped according to the regulative principles— Kṛṣṇa . And the same doll, kept in the sculptor's showroom, it is stone. So if we keep our movement pure, then you are as strong as Kṛṣṇa . And as soon as you deviate from it, immediately, ordinary. This is the secret. Now it is up to us, how to keep it pure. Then no enemy can kill us. Nobody can kill you. That purity is wanted, then it will... So what is there difficulty? Their purity to kill him(?). Follow the rules and regulations, worship the Deity, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , as you have given, then you will remain as strong as Kṛṣṇa . And if we manufacture some idea also, that is no good. Kṛṣṇa cannot be manufactured; Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa . You cannot manufacture another form competitor of Kṛṣṇa . That is no good. Then failure. Just like the, your one competitor came to, even in the lifetime of Kṛṣṇa , Pauṇḍraka ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," With artificial four hands. You know that? (laughs) That is no (indistinct). This movement is actually the real movement to raise the human society. And if we create factions, then the movement will be less strong and will not act very (indistinct). (pause) Australian dollar question is solved with you? And this check can be deposited."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : I think it will turn out OK.,Prabhupāda, But this dealing of the bank is very...
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Not good. I know. I complained to the bank manager also.,Prabhupāda, So this is right.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They said their hands were tied because the specimen signature on the check...,Prabhupāda, They give me writing check.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Why you are talking? Give me writing, that this is not bona fide. Then we take this step, ""Your check nonpayment: we will have to take steps."" ""We wanted this money; we have deposited the money there, and you are not paying. What is this?"""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We are being inconvenienced by...,Prabhupāda," ""So now you have to pay the balance. We did not carry the money, took a check, and immediately pay, now you have detained it. So you give me in writing why you are not paying. Then we shall take steps. We should not be punished."" Sometimes they take advantage, ""Oh, he is servant(?) class, he must be fool number one."" (chuckles) They think it. [break] ...no loss or commission."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Not on the check.,Prabhupāda," Check, there is no question. They can deposit immediately in our account. It is cashier's check; it has to be cashed immediately. So did you ask about the dollars, despatching to India?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They said they would...,Prabhupāda," No, no difficult, but what is rate?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The rate, ah, 11.34 American cents equals one rupee.",Prabhupāda, 11.34.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes. I haven't converted into how many... I can do that.,Prabhupāda," 11.34, that is good rate. So I wish that... We should combine the work very vigorously when this (indistinct). They are just like women, equal in preaching (indistinct). You keep some women together, and they fight. The children together, they will fight. Dogs together, they will fight. Sane man, why they will fight? Where is the cause of fight? Then you are (indistinct) to become woman. Worse. This material world is such that even you keep some utensil together, when dealing, tung, tung, tung, tung, tung, what to speak of individuals souls. But our cause is the common, how to push on. That soberness must be there. I can give you points, instructions, you will have to put it into shape; otherwise how it will go on?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We can understand that Your Divine Grace does not want factions.,Prabhupāda, That will better the movement.
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it just seems there is a... The (indistinct) is that there seems to be a difference in the way Kṛṣṇa consciousness is being...",Prabhupāda, Why different?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Well, there's only one way...",Prabhupāda, So now why there should be different? The formula is there. Why there should be difference?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Then there is someone who's not doing it properly according to the...,Prabhupāda," There is (indistinct), that should be settled up. Suppose you are not doing properly, I can say, ""This is this,"" do, show you how to do it other way. [break] Where is Govinda dāsī ? Where is the Deity information? She is manufacturing some (indistinct)."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] In India, Punjab National give us 8.84."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, (aside:) That's all right. Just put over (here). (indistinct) [break] That I want.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : That we should work together.,Prabhupāda, Yes. What is this (indistinct)?
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : There's no problem with... [break] ...as far as distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness like that, but the thing is they simply don't want to cooperate with the ISKCON movement.",Prabhupāda, But why?
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : That no one knows. They simply just don't want to mix.,Prabhupāda, That we can settle up by sitting together. Why there should be difference?
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : Just like in New Zealand, originally they split from ISKCON, and now gradually you are bringing them back to the same standard again, like now you're encouraging them to build a temple and install Deities. That means they have to come up to the required brahminical standard again. So why was there any need to go away in the first place? But still they won't cooperate. Now they'll have to do it their own way. This is..., that's their problem.",Prabhupāda," One thousand. No, don't tear. It is written there, ""One thousand."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes. There's fifties and twenties. There's one fifty note, one hundred notes, twenty notes...",Prabhupāda, (indistinct)
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Usually, when they write like this, they're the same denomination.",Prabhupāda," Anyway, you can count, yes. [break]"
Siddha-svarūpa,"Siddha - svarūpa : There are a lot of devotees here who follow the principles but cannot completely... [break] ...shaved up, and they still wear karmī clothes pretty much, but they're clean, they're devotees, and in this way they're attracting many of the local people, because they're able to relate to them.",Prabhupāda, So that...
Siddha-svarūpa,Siddha - svarūpa : They're not lowering your standard.,Prabhupāda," No, naturally, but when they are initiated they must shave. They must keep to the standard. If one becomes initiated and he still keeps the hippie form, that does not look nice. Do you think that is all right? No, that is not good. So long they are coming as outsider, joining kīrtana , they may have their own dress, it doesn't matter. They are coming to kīrtana , that must be (indistinct). But when they are to be initiated, they must follow the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master."
Siddha-svarūpa,Siddha - svarūpa : So...,Prabhupāda," Otherwise they should not be initiated. It is simple thing. Let them go on chanting, taking prasādam ; we have no (indistinct). But when they are to be initiated, they must follow. This is the clear (indistinct). If you don't want to disturb them, let them come, chant, dance, take prasādam We have no objection. But don't recommend them for initiation unless he agrees to the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master. Where is the wrong? Where is the difficulty? You can talk with him like that."
Siddha-svarūpa,Siddha - svarūpa : I think they only feel that because...,Prabhupāda," No feeling, if you..., when you are surrendering to the spiritual... Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [ Bg . 2.7 ] . Find out this verse. Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā ."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : ""Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Enquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.""",Prabhupāda," You have to submit. You cannot remain independent. That is the first condition. Śiṣyas te 'haṁ, śiṣya . Śiṣya means voluntarily accepting the rules offered by the spiritual master. That is śiṣya : ""Ah, yes, I agree to abide by your order."" Then he becomes śiṣya . Otherwise where is the question... ""I am thinking like this, I am thinking..."" So long you are thinking otherwise, you don't try to become a śiṣya . You remain outside and you are welcome: chant, dance, take prasādam , and remain independent. There is no objection. But when you become śiṣya , then you cannot remain independent. These things convince him. Then you don't become śiṣya . Remain as friend, there is no harm. Just like so many people, they come. So if these things (indistinct). One thousand twenty, checks (indistinct). This way. What is the wrong there?"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : So then part of initiation means that you're prepared to do something more than simply chant and eat prasādam ?,Prabhupāda," Initiation means to follow instructions of the spiritual master. That is the first (indistinct) And if there is still hesitation to surrender to the rules and regulations, then all other (indistinct)."
Siddha-svarūpa,"Siddha - svarūpa : I think it is pretty clear, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's just for clarification, that they're working, they have a store on..., a very nice store, they're distributing foodstuffs to all the other stores on the island, and they're working a lot within the society with the karmīs, I guess. So their thinking is that ""If we shave our heads and wear robes, like that, then they'll look at us...",Prabhupāda," That is not... Because imitating. Officially don't chant. Who is prohibiting to chant? You can chant, you can dance, you can take prasādam ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Can they actually say that ""His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is my spiritual master"" if they haven't accepted all of the instructions?",Prabhupāda, Eh?

We have got that simple thing, you can follow. What is the use? False propaganda. Because you think that we could not accept... (indistinct) ...we are trying to follow the (indistinct)."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : One of the differences that first sprung up between the two groups was that one group was going out when you were saying ""Go out and distribute books profusely,"" so they were going and distributing. And they had various means of doing it. Some were not so good, but still the books were going out. Then the group that split away, they were saying, ""Ah, you're disturbing the public by these methods of book distribution. We don't want..."" This is what happened in Australia, the one temple in Brisbane. They became very much against the saṅkīrtana methods, and as a result they gave up the saṅkīrtana program altogether and then went to live on farms like this, and they left the temple and the temple was finished. So like this, they were saying that ""We're still following Prabhupāda's instructions, but we..."" But they were saying that the devotees who were distributing the books, they were not following instructions. Like that.",Prabhupāda," His Divine Grace has said that ""You distribute book,"" and why do you say that?"
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : Well, their idea was that because sometimes the public is becoming disturbed by the book distribution, then therefore it's not being done correctly. So it should be stopped.",Prabhupāda," Public may disturb, but we are following our own course of action. It is not obligatory. We are requesting you, ""Take this book."" That is not obligatory. ""If you like, you can take. If you don't like, don't take."""
Siddha-svarūpa; Hari-śauri,"Siddha - svarūpa : I think that...; Hari - śauri : So what their idea was that we shall build some public relations, like you said with this store. They prefer to try to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness by public relations, give good impression, and then people will come.",Prabhupāda," Then you are dictated by the public, not by the dictation of your spiritual master. Spiritual master has ordered to distribute books; you shall do that. That is obedience. Now the public may take or not take, that is public's option. But my duty is—because spiritual master has said—I must try my best. Spiritual master has not said that ""You must sell so many books daily, otherwise I will reject you."" He has not said that. So everyone may try his best, that's all. The public may take or not take, it doesn't matter. And if you are, want to please the public, public says that ""You dance naked, I will be very happy with you, I'll give you (indistinct)."" So I'll have to do that. Then what is the use of making a spiritual master? Public, they have got their whims, how to become pleased. So we are to follow all these things? We have to follow our instruction of the spiritual master. That is... (indistinct) Why to manufacture ""The public will be pleased like this""? Public may or may not give you, what you can do?"
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : Our success is in the spiritual master's pleasure, not the public's pleasure.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is bhakti . Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ]? ""You haven't got to please so many religious instructions. You simply please Me."" That is Kṛṣṇa's..."
Siddha-svarūpa,"Siddha - svarūpa : I don't think the devotees who factioned out were against book distribution. I think that a little bit was that some of the devotees were using very, very forceful tactics and trying to give people books and take their money, and people were becoming very offended...",Prabhupāda, That is not (indistinct).
Siddha-svarūpa; Hari-śauri; Siddha-svarūpa; Hari-śauri,"Siddha - svarūpa : That is not what you want.; Hari - śauri : That's all right, but don't give up the book distribution.; Siddha - svarūpa : Yes.; Hari - śauri : This is what happened. The temples fell down, the devotees went away. The ones who were distributing the books went on and distributed more books, became more expert, so that the public were not so much disturbed, and still they're distributing books. But these people who factioned off are not distributing books even now, two or three years later. So it was simply actually a question of faultfinding more than earnest desire to please the spiritual master.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (pause) Discuss.
Devotee; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end); Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ...come Sunday easily. Charge them.... You know like in Los Angeles, we used to charge a dollar a...",Prabhupāda, The loan will be clear very soon.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes. They have a.... They are very expert at financing now, these, the men who are in charge now. They're claiming that within two or three months all of the debt will be completely cleared. They have a plan, very easy.",Prabhupāda, (chuckles) He is the right person.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. And the restaurant is very successful. Also they have not advertised that, but every day about fifty people come for the lunch, and at least another seventy, eighty people come in the evening for dinner. For a full meal each person pays an average about $2.50.",Prabhupāda, That's cheap.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : All you can eat for two dollars...,Prabhupāda, And for public it is very cheap.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very inexpensive. And if they advertise it, they won't be able to handle all the people who come. It's such a central location.",Prabhupāda," It will be automatically advertised. When people will say, ""Oh, there is a nice ISKCON restaurant, and it is so cheap and so nice,"" people will come. Just like in our Vṛndāvana temple, we don't advertise. Of course, that's.... People are coming by thousands. I thought that so long distance from the city, nobody will come. But Balarāma is so powerful, He's bringing: ""Come out here."" (laughter) Otherwise, I was.... What is that? Plowing? Yamunā was threatened."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, Balarāma .",Prabhupāda, And the whole Kuru dynasty was threatened.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very good class of people are coming to the restaurant, businessmen, like that.",Prabhupāda, And there is book display?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes. Oh, yes, there's a book display.",Prabhupāda, They are purchasing book also?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. They give them a Back to Godhead, complimentary copy...",Prabhupāda, Ācchā.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ...with the meal. And then they also purchase books. The buses are going on nicely. All the buses are out. Two more buses are being made now.,Prabhupāda," Oh, you are adding two more."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. Well, we had almost finished two. They'll be added in June, so that will make eight, a total of eight. And they're having a normal program going on nicely. And Madhudviṣa Mahārāja also went to visit the other temples. He said in Boston they've gotten.... I think they've already gotten it, right? That restaurant? Ambarīṣa Prabhu has gotten the most wonderful restaurant there, just around the corner from the temple. So it will be very, very high class restaurant with waiters, and...",Prabhupāda," Now, this New York restaurant being organized, other restaurant will follow."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : This restaurant down here, I just was there. Gaura - govinda , he's the one who decorated it. First class. People really like it.",Prabhupāda," From the very beginning I was asking to open restaurant and farm. Produce ghee in the farm and send to the restaurant, and make nice samosā, kachori preparation, and there will be no scarcity of money. And if you organize in this way, your whole country will be transferred into Kṛṣṇa conscious country. Whole country. So, what about your China program?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, we went to New York to meet with Dhṛṣṭadyumna Mahārāja's father, and he was very helpful. We approached him in a frank way, and he immediately got the help of his office. He's the president of this Far East American Council.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. And not only China, this is for all of Asia. It includes as.... Some of the persons belonging to it are the chairman of Coca-Cola, the Bankers Trust Company first vice president, all of the big banks, Bank of America senior vice president, First National City Bank vice president, all of these men.",Prabhupāda," So you can contract with all big, big men."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. And he's the president of the council.,Prabhupāda, His father?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then he is very influential man.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very. So he immediately got...,Prabhupāda, So you should be like father like son.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He has the same name. It's just ""Junior"" at the end, so they know him.",Prabhupāda," No, intelligence also. Father's intelligence he must inherit. There is an Indian proverb, bāpakā beṭā sepāikā ghoḍā , kucha nehi to thoḍā thoḍā (indistinct), mean ""The father's son and the soldier's horse, they acquire the quality, if not all, some, must."" If one is good soldier, his horse is also trained up. There is a history in India. The horse has played heroic. The Queen of Jhansi's horse and this, our, what is called, Shivaji's horse, they have played unique part in the history. Sepāikā ghoḍā . It is animal, but because it is the horse of a famous hero, it has played. Similarly, the son of father must be as good as father. If not, to some extent. Yes. So you are the.... Your father is the leader of so many big, big businessmen. You also become leader."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : For Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : For Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. And you have got the intelligence. I have seen. I have studied you. Now you combine. Both of you, you are intelligent. You turn the whole America Kṛṣṇa conscious. Bas. Then success all over the world. America is the leader of the nations. Now, if the America becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, then our movement is perfectly successful. And you have got the potency in America."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : These men are all in Asia, though. His father's biggest concern.... See, his father.... The company is divided into two: the American branch of Seagrams, and the overseas, which incorporates the whole world outside of America. His father is the president of overseas. So his father has all connections with all of the embassies overseas, all of the big corporations overseas.",Prabhupāda," So all these big, big men, let them have one set of books and study. It is not any expenditure for them, but if at their leisure hour they read some of the line—they are all intelligent men-they'll get ideas, what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So through the influence of father, just try to introduce our books to these big men. It is not.... They may keep them in library, and at leisure hour, if they simply glance over the line, oh, it will be great success."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : And their sons will also read it.,Prabhupāda, Their sons also will read.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Already my father has noticed in his travels that some of his friends, their sons have joined our movement now too.",Prabhupāda," Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ , lokas tad anuvartate [ Bg . 3.21 ] . If these big men of the world, they take it, ""Oh, yes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is genuine,"" then naturally it will be followed by the others. So here is a good opportunity to contact big men of the world. So utilize it properly. You.... Both of you are intelligent. Very cautiously deal with them. They will understand that ""Oh, these people are very honest men of character and high knowledge and God conscious."" That will make our movement success."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : His father has been giving us.... Of course, it was.... We have been approaching him through the aspect of doing business in China. His father is encouraging us in the sense that he is seeing Dhṛṣṭadyumna .... Like whenever we visit him, we come in our suits, and his father is seeing that.... He is encouraging him also because he's taking some, what he calls a very, what would you say, a responsible position, attempting to do some business. So he's been giving us letters on his company's letterhead. Just like this is a letter to the director of the Department of Commerce of the United States. We've seen a number of people. We've been visiting different directors. First thing we did when we went back is after meeting him, we got many books on China. Some of the examples are, just like this.... We read about twenty-five books. We've studied up very thoroughly and researched everything about China. Here is a book, The Religious Policy and Practice in Communist China. It describes everything about religion there. So we thoroughly read this book. Then there's other books, books on education, we read books on history...",Prabhupāda," Chinese people, they are trying to raise their standard of civilization. Do they?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Śrīla Prabhupāda, many.... Their philosophy is called dialectic materialism. They want to advance materially and they.... We have prepared one report of an interview with the president of a committee on United States and China relations. He's one of the leading experts in China. So after researching and studying all the educational, the libraries, all the different functions in China, we went and spoke with this gentleman.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : First we got a lot of information ourselves, so we'd be knowledgeable. We read for one month. We got.... We wrote away to all the councils, we got hundreds of books like this, special reports about China, we read them, and then we went to meet this man, because he is the most knowledgeable expert person on China in the United States. And we made up a report which we wanted to read to you, because it gives everything very nicely. It tells what China is doing now, and what our program can be for book distribution.",Prabhupāda," No, what is their aim? After studying all these books, what do you think? What is the aim of China? What is the objective they are making progress towards?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Their aim is that everyone should be materially comfortable. There should be no...,Prabhupāda," In that case, they should, if they have got sense.... Just like in the whole world, these American people are materially comfortable. But why they are producing hippies now?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : They see this as a fault of the system, capitalism. They say that capitalism means the enjoyment of the few at the...",Prabhupāda, Materialism means capitalism.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Well, they want communistic materialism. In other words, by creating, forming communes, everyone will get equal portion of food and bedding and clothing and medicine.",Prabhupāda," No, that is not the fact. A man's tendency is that everyone wants to get more. So how they will check it? This is already proved in Russia."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They condemn Russia. They say Russia is a failure.,Prabhupāda," And similarly, they will have to condemn. If they follow the wrong path, they will have the wrong result. This is not..."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Their leader, Mao Tse Tung, he was very austere, and he is very moral, and he has these purges where he takes the men who he sees are not..., or who are trying to use their position for their own power, and he takes it away from them. They are constantly going through these purges of their system to insure that no one enjoys more than others, at the expense of others.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Artificial, though.",Prabhupāda," So that is artificial way of.... Unless one is prepared to.... Just like why they are inducing persons to sacrifice their accumulated wealth for the state? Why? Communistic idea that everyone should be equal. So if somebody has more than others, they want to take it away. Just like in India this policy is now growing. So everyone should give away, but now it is being done by law, by force. But that will not stay."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We also agree it's a failure.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It is bound to fail.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Unless you voluntarily give, it will be failure. You will try to find out ways how you can take everything.... Just like income tax. The government is trying to take more money from the public, and public is hiding them in black market. This is going on. Nobody is.... Even your Nixon, he also hidden some money from the income tax. Why? He is the head of the government. So one side, he is head of the government, try to take money from the public, but he personally himself, he is hiding. Why this defect?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : They will say that the system encourages man's greed, whereas their system...",Prabhupāda," No, no, system.... If the.... You cannot change the mind. If you have got mind to enjoy more, by force if I try to force you not to enjoy more, give to the state, this is a struggle. This is not perfect process."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They say that will be corrected by education.,Prabhupāda, Education.... That means what is that education?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They say that the.... They don't.... Of course, we say education means Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Education means they must learn to sacrifice everything for the topmost.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They say the topmost is the general mass of everyone, the proletariat, all people combined.",Prabhupāda," That's all right, general. But you know how to make general mass of people happy. That example we give, that the whole body.... You can make the whole body happy simply by supplying food to the stomach. That is the best way. And if you want to make happy every part of the body, individual, that will never be successful. You must know where to touch. Just like the huge machine is going on by the expert manipulation of the pilot. He is pushing one.... Works. Immediately the plane becomes.... It is.... So you must know where to touch. If.... I am layman, I am put into that, then, instead of putting here, I shall put my here, and then it will go down. ""Ohhh."" So finished. So this is nature's way, that you supply food to the stomach, and the energy will be distributed every part. You supply water to the root of the tree, it will be supplied everywhere. That you must know. Otherwise, if you.... Just like if you do not know, a expert, not expert, so he's advised, ""Give to, the food to the stomach."" ""And in where?"" ""No, in the hole of the body."" If he does not, which hole, then he will put somewhere, sometimes here, sometimes here, sometimes here, sometimes here. It will never act. Then you must know the science how to make everyone happy. If you do not know that, then your imperfect imagination will never be done, and that has become everywhere. Why there is difference of opinion even both of the communistic countries? Why there is difference of opinion between Russia and China? Because both of you do not know how to make everyone happy. That is the point."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : China has achieved great material strides in the last twenty years. There is no prostitution. They have wiped out flies, no more flies causing disease. There is.... And they look to a very bitter past of exploitation at the hand of foreigners and internal civil war and great suffering and starvation. So when they look back over twenty years they see, ""Oh, we have advanced greatly."" So they are very satisfied.",Prabhupāda," No, if they actually progressing, they will have to come to that point—that is natural—where, placing your service, you can serve everyone. That is the right conclusion. But we have got that right conclusion. If you take from us you can make immediately. But if you want to wait by your research work, then you can waste your time. But you have to come to this point. That is a fact. Just like you have to give food to the mouth. If you do not know, out of rascaldom you experiment here, you experiment here, you experiment here, you experiment.... There are so many holes. You go on experimenting, and waste your time. But unless you come to this point, that ""Food has to be supplied here,"" your all attempt will be failure. That you have to tell them. And because you cannot supersede nature's way. Nature's way is ""The food must go through here."" You cannot change it. You are not above nature."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : They say that you can become above nature.,Prabhupāda, That is foolishness. That will make them failure.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Oh, yes, they will fail.",Prabhupāda," That will make them failure. Tell them, then this will make them failure. ""If you are so foolish that you want to go above nature, then you are fool number one."" Daivī hy eṣā guṇa - mayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] . It is not possible. That is not possible. Then you are following wrong path. If you are imagining like that, that ""We have surpassed the laws of nature,"" then you are fool number one."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In that respect they are like the Americans and Russians. They think that we can overcome the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are just like the Americans and Russians in the same way. They are thinking we can overcome the stringent laws of nature.,Prabhupāda," No, that is the foolishness. Mūḍha . Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . So long they will have this impression that they can overcome the laws of nature they will continue to become mūḍha ."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Śrīla Prabhupāda, another problem...",Prabhupāda," In which way you have surpassed nature? First of all, if you are thinking like that, in which way you have surpassed the nature?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They say, ""For example, before we began our agricultural development, there was very poor agricultural produce all over the country due to lack of proper water. Now we have laid huge irrigation systems, and there is no more drought.""",Prabhupāda," Therefore that is nature's way. Nature supplies you water. That is nature's way. That means you are making perfect according to the nature's way. But nature give you water; you produce profusely. But if you want to go above the nature, you produce without water."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : (laughs) It can't be done.,Prabhupāda," Then we shall see that you have surpassed the laws of.... The laws of nature is there must be water. Nature is supplying. And you are trying to imitate. But if you say that ""We can overpass the nature's law,"" then you produce without water. Then you'll be able. Then we shall see that you have gone above.... This, you are following the nature's. That is not surpassed. That is following little properly. Now you have arranged for water. That's very good. But if nature pours water, then you save so much labor. Do you know that, how nature will supply water profusely? You haven't got to make artificial arrangement for water. Do you know that? Ask them. We know that."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Formerly their society was very much like the Vedic culture. There was the emperor and the...,Prabhupāda," Yes, it was.... The Chinese people were coming, taking knowledge from.... Everyone was coming. So now argument that ""If you are.... You are following the nature's way. Nature supply water. That is a fact. Here is cloud. Nature will supply. Now, if you want to surpass nature, then you produce in the factory, without water, food grains. Then we shall understand that you can surpass. As you are producing instruments and so many other motorcars and this, that, so many, in the factory, that's all right. In the factory you produce food grains without water. Then you have surpassed nature."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They can't do that.,Prabhupāda," Then where is the question of surpassing nature? Make them fool in every point, these rascals, by argument."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,"Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Unfortunately, they do not teach any philosophy anymore. They have done away with all...",Prabhupāda, This is not philosophy.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Yes. This is science.,Prabhupāda," This philosophy, it is science. Without water you cannot produce. This is science. This is not imagination. So if you want to surpass nature, then you do practically. Why should you try to bring canal water or well water? Don't bring. You cannot surpass the laws of nature. That has to be accepted."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Their main point is that they want to manipulate expertly the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda, That means let them waste their time. Therefore it requires many births to understand this law. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. 7.19 ] .
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They're going away from this kind of understanding. They had a heritage of philosophical understanding, correct philosophical.... They were very.... For instance, their whole system during the time of Confucius.... Up until two or three hundred years ago their system was they had a monarchy, a king, an emperor, and the emperor was believed to be the representative of God.",Prabhupāda, That is good.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And it was Vedic. They had a brāhmaṇa community. They called them scholars who were advising. And they had administrators, and they had workers. Now the current Communists, they are against that system. They say this system was the worst system of all because it made some big and some small. Because naturally it became...",Prabhupāda," But you are doing the same thing. Otherwise why you are reforming? Who is reforming unless the one class is very intelligent? The same situation. You.... Your, what is that rascal's name?"
Dhṛṣṭadyumna; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Mao Tse Tung.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Mao. Mao.,Prabhupāda, So he is supposed to be intelligent. He is supposed to be intelligent. So the two classes already there.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, he says everyone can be equally intelligent.",Prabhupāda," That is another thing, but these classes must remain, the teacher class and the student class."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Here's what they do. They take the teachers.... This is one of their program. Actually we have written a report which explains. They take the teachers, and they send the teachers out into the factory and into the farms for years.",Prabhupāda," So anywhere you send, the student and teacher class is there. You change the name, you change the process, it doesn't matter, but the student class and teacher class will always remain. That is your foolishness. You are simply changing different names. But originally, as planned by nature, that is always there."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : They say let the factory worker teach the teacher.,Prabhupāda," Anyway, teacher class, rascal, it is teacher class. You make a teacher class."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They say everyone should be teachers.,Prabhupāda," That ""should be"" means not."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, they are making everyone teachers.",Prabhupāda," And this ""making"" means not."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : They are trying to make.,Prabhupāda," That is all right. The classes, two classes, are there. You cannot change that. ""Trying,"" ""making,"" means two."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : It's artificial.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Just like they let the students teach the teachers.,Prabhupāda, That's right. So the teachers.... Sometimes you become teacher; sometimes I become teacher. What is this?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They're trying to create a society where there are no superior-inferior.,Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Classless society.,Prabhupāda, They are taking themselves the superior position to make it one.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : (laughs) Yes. That's a fact.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like some of the rascal swamis come here that ""There is no teacher of.... No require teacher, no need of books."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Then why do we need them ?,Prabhupāda," And these rascals are writing books, that ""There is no need of book."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That happened. One swami said, ""Now you.... Meditation means don't think of anything."" So then one of our men at the meeting raised his hand and said, ""Then why do we need you?"" So he got very angry. He said, ""If the mind should do nothing, what do we need you for?""",Prabhupāda, So what was his reply?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He told his men to usher our man out. His men got very agitated because there was no reply. He couldn't give a reply, so they asked our man to leave for disturbing the sleeping of the public.",Prabhupāda," Anyway, the whole world is rascal. They will manufacture and spoil time, their own time and others' time."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda, we did a report telling.... We wanted to read this to you. It gives you an idea of what are the possibilities of spreading your books or Kṛṣṇa consciousness in China. We made up a report for you. Do you want to hear it?",Prabhupāda, Hm.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Okay, you want to read it, Dhṛṣṭadyumna ? 'Cause it is actually very useful, if not now, in the future, because this report is based on a lot of research. Read. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...that if they are rascals, then don't try. You see? Reject them. But there is good potency in your country. You do peacefully here. If they are rascals, means stubborn rascals..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You cannot imagine how rascal they are. That's why we wrote this report.,Prabhupāda, Then don't try. Don't waste time.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Dhṛṣṭadyumna; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's a.... The Christians, they have a boat two hundred miles off the China coast, and they put little Bibles in cellophane bags and let the Bibles float into China.; Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Balloons.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Balloons. That's how hard it is to preach there.",Prabhupāda, That is also nonsense.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, it's nonsense, but the point is how difficult it is. We have...",Prabhupāda," Then don't try. Don't waste time. Don't try. Better try in your country. You have got enough field, and they are intelligent and they are favorable. So why should we waste our time? There is no need. If you make your country, America, God conscious, Kṛṣṇa conscious—they are already—that will be example to the whole world. These men, rascals' program, will be failure, finished, this, today or tomorrow. They'll never be successful. It is not.... That is not possible. If they have so foolishly declared that ""We are going above the laws of nature,"" they're first-class rascals. Which is impossible. What they have conquered over the nature? These rascals will not die?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, they'll still die.",Prabhupāda," Then? Then what is this? The rascals will not become old men? So what they have surpassed, laws of nature? What way? Simply making the teachers student and student teacher. Simply wasting time. Better you utilize your father's position, but for introducing our books to these high class men. Just you are trying to introduce books in the university libraries, similarly, you try to introduce these books to the high class. And that is not difficult. These men, they have got enough money. If they spend one thousand dollar for our books, that is nothing for them."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : One of your disciples, Praghoṣa , he's the biggest book distributor, practically. Tripurāri trained him up. He is now starting a program of meeting with these executives and doing just this. He is working in New York, and he's developing a program like this.",Prabhupāda, Now in India also they are trying. Yaśomatī.... Yaśodānandana's report is that he approached one head librarian in Andhra Pradesh and...
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Karnataka.,Prabhupāda," Karnataka. Karnataka province, educated province, Karnataka, South India, Karnataka, very educated. So he has immediately ordered thirty sets of books in different libraries. He has appreciated so much."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The professors in Bombay, some of them are already reviewing Prabhupāda's books very favorably.",Prabhupāda," So you just touch the topmost men. But if, somehow or other, if you see some of the topmost men of the China, ""You kindly read our books at your leisure."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You can't approach those men.,Prabhupāda," Then give it up. If it is too difficult, don't waste time."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's not only difficult, it's impossible.",Prabhupāda, Then don't waste time.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Completely impossible.,Prabhupāda, Give up this idea.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It may be possible fifty years from now.,Prabhupāda, That's all right. Our descendants will try for that. But let us try where it is favorable. Don't waste time.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We were really, you know, just looking for any loophole, but there is no loophole.",Prabhupāda, No hole. That's all right. We don't care for it.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The man we spoke to, when he heard what we wanted to do, he said, ""Boys, you're up against the wall."" He said, ""You're up against the Great Wall."" China has a wall called the Great Wall. He said, ""You've come up against the Great Wall. You'll never cross it.""",Prabhupāda," No, they'll be.... Nature's law is so strong that they are also trying to knock their head in the wall. They will themselves break their head. The laws of nature is the same. If you try to break the walls from this side and if they try to break the walls from that side, both of them will lose their head. So if they are so foolish.... They are foolish. Everywhere such foolish men are there. They are trying to overcome the laws of nature. That is the greatest foolishness. That is the greatest foolishness. Just like government has got police force, military force, and if somebody tries to become, violate the laws of government by defying police force and military force—that is futile. Is it possible, that ""I shall defy the government laws""? No, there is police force. There is military. ""I don't care for that."" It is foolishness. It is simply foolishness. Similarly, these laws of nature means the force of the Supreme. So if you want to defy, you may waste your time. It is not possible. And practically, Kṛṣṇa says, ""Here I have enforced this miserable condition of material life."" Janma - mṛtyu - jarā - vyādhi - duḥkha -doṣānu [Bg. 13.9 ]. First of all surpass this, janma - mṛtyu - jarā - vyādhi . Then talk of surpassing the laws of nature. Can the Communists overcome, stopping old age? No Communist will be old man? Then what way you have surpassed the laws of nature? No Communist will die? Then where is your surpassing laws of nature? Ultimately you are under the grip of laws of nature. So what is the meaning of this foolish talking, that ""I am going to surpass the laws of nature""? Show us first of all."
Dhṛṣṭadyumna,Dhṛṣṭadyumna : Their goal is not so broad. They just want to control the...,Prabhupāda," That means the little children's policy. Children, just like imagining so many things, ""I shall do that. I shall do."" The potter's imagination. You know that? Potter's imagination? You do not know the story? One potter is selling earthen pots, and he is saying that ""Now, these two paisā , it has cost me one paisā . I shall make one paisā profit. Then I can make such profit. I shall invest again. I shall make another profit, another profit. In this way I shall become millionaire. Then I shall marry, and my wife shall be very obedient. And if (s)he does not become obedient, I shall give him a kick like this."" And he, what was.... One pot was there. He kicked that pot and broke. (laughter) It broke. ""Oh, again I am poor man."" So this is going on, imagination. Imagination.... ""I shall become so great that I shall kick Kṛṣṇa's law,"" and whatever pot he had-broken. That's all. Rascals, simply rascals. If anyone thinks like that, that ""I shall surpass the laws of nature,"" then he's madman. He's madman. So what is the use of dealing with madmen? And as soon as you challenge them that ""Show us that you have surpassed the laws of nature,"" ""Yes, we are trying. In future we shall do."" That's all. This is their reply. So it is better to avoid such men. But if you peacefully you can introduce, ""All right, you will do. You are wonderful men, so kindly if you read some pages of this, it is not very costly. You can keep. At leisure hour you can read,"" in this way, imploring, then they will be benefited. That much we can do to any rascal. He sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya dūrāt caitanya - candra - caraṇe : ""Oh, you are so nice. Therefore I am flattering you. I humbly obeisance. Kindly hear one thing. Keep some books. It is not very costly."" Bas. This much you can do. And let them become puffed up by their false notions. But if they keep some books, sometimes they will read or their sons will read. That's all. Therefore I am stressing so much on books, that if the puffed-up rascals take some book and sometimes, if they read, he'll be benefited, perfectly benefited. So distribute these books anywhere possible. It doesn't matter where it is. The same process. Dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya . The books will sell, that ""You rascal number one, you set aside whatever learned. Read this."" He sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya : ""You are very learned, but forget what you have learned, all rascaldom. Try to read this book."" Tāvac ca śobhate mūrkho yāvat kiñcin na bhāṣate : ""A rascal fool is very beautifully dressed, very nice sitting. But his rascaldom will be disclosed as soon as he will speak."" So these rascals, as soon as they speak, ""We shall surpass the laws of nature,"" then we can understand what kind of rascals. Tāvac ca śobhate mūrkhaḥ . By their, these words we can take, ""Oh, rascaldom,"" at once. ""I shall break the wall. I shall push the mountain with my head."" It is like that. If somebody is thinking that ""I shall push the Himalayan mountains by knocking with my head,"" then we can understand. So where it is? A rascal, the innocent, he is also rascal. But innocent is eager to become intelligent, so there we shall deal. And the stubborn atheists, they are dviṣat . They cannot be corrected immediately, unless they become ruined. [break] ...their standard of life. Try for that. Concentrate in your country. There is no need of going.... I was written, asking you that, that ""If it is very hard job, don't try for that, useless waste of time."" Incorrigible. So what is the use of going to a person...?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We also researched a little bit about Russia. After we saw how it looked here—it was impossible—we were looking towards Russia. So we did some research on Russia also. There it's a little bit more open, but it's also, in terms of any kind of broad program, it is practically impossible. For example, distribution of books in Russia, there's only one company that buys the books. There's only one import...",Prabhupāda," No, let him. One?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. (end); Would you like me to do anything? What would you like me to do? I know I don't want to be independent.,Prabhupāda," Why you are inclined to follow Siddha - svarūpa , your wife and you. What is your special attraction?"
Bhūrijana,(indistinct) ...we couldn't always be corresponding with you. I needed some personal instruction.,Prabhupāda," But first of all (indistinct) you what is the special attraction? Your wife said that their instruction is very clear. So what is the distinction between clear and ambiguous. What do you find ambiguous, what do you find clear? What is that?"
Bhūrijana,"I think the part I found clear, the more introspective points about humility, and changing one's desires...",Prabhupāda, Humility means not to follow the instruction of guru ? That is not...
Bhūrijana,"No, that is not humility.",Prabhupāda, I'm asking you what is the special attraction? You say... Your wife says it is very clear. What is that clear and ambiguous?
Bhūrijana,You mean what is ambiguous and... (indistinct) what is ambiguous or what...,Prabhupāda," No. You say that is very clear what others are telling you. Now what is that ambiguous, what is that clear?"
Bhūrijana,The clearness may be a deeper understanding to want to be humble. A deeper understanding to want to...,Prabhupāda," Humble, but if you do not follow your spiritual master's instruction, you follow others, then where is the humbleness? You say that... Your wife says that what Siddha - svarūpa says it is very clear and and others are not so clear. Is it not? What is that clear what is not clear?"
Bhūrijana,He says chant Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, So who says that you don't chant?
Bhūrijana,"Maybe the emphasis wasn't so much on the chanting even though everyone says harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] , everyone just chants their sixteen rounds a day, chants a half hour ārati in the evening and half hour ārati in the morning.",Prabhupāda, So what do you want more? What is your program? 24 hours?
Bhūrijana,I like more kīrtana than that.,Prabhupāda, So you don't like to sell books.
Bhūrijana,"No, I think I like very much. I mean I think I would like to.",Prabhupāda, So what is difference?
Bhūrijana,Between selling books and kīrtana ?,Prabhupāda," No no. Between others and you. Where is the difference? When you point out that this is the point, we differ. What is that point?"
Bhūrijana,Well maybe the point about more kīrtana or less kīrtana .,Prabhupāda," So if you chant more, they're objecting?"
Bhūrijana,No.,Prabhupāda, Then where is the difference? Has anyone objected (if you) chant more?
Bhūrijana,No.,Prabhupāda, Then where is the objection? What is the point of difference?
Bhūrijana,I think there's no point of difference.,Prabhupāda, Then why do you say we find these instructions more clear?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You say that there's no point of difference, but then you say that his instruction is more clear. There's some contradiction.; It's just the emphasis that was given to hari ... to chanting. For myself, I know I was off track and I know that in my heart I built up an enmity toward your disciples and thinking that they..., that by their distributing books they were making people angry at Kṛṣṇa and...",Prabhupāda, That is real point. That is real point.
Bhūrijana,"That's what I felt. See, when I was in Hong Kong, people I would meet, they used to yell... They'd yell at me, ""What have you done to Kṛṣṇa ?"" Some Indians used to say that. People we'd meet, they'd tell us they see the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees and they hate Kṛṣṇa . I remember one specific time when I was speaking to one businessman who was helping us and...",Prabhupāda," He said that ""We hate Kṛṣṇa""?"
Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana,"No no. He said that, ""Your members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa , they're making people in Australia hate Kṛṣṇa . They make people inimical."" Making people inimical to Kṛṣṇa .; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They feel threatened simply that we're preaching something that will discourage their sinful way of life. Simply they feel threatened. Not they're hating. Their argument is that because of our strong emphasis on preaching and book distrubtion, they say therefore that the mass of people they have a bad impression of Kṛṣṇa .; And also because...",Prabhupāda, Because we are selling books.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Harisauri,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Because we're selling books.; Not so much the selling books. Maybe because of the emphasis on taking..., how much money can be taken. Like if someone says on the street, ""Please give me a donation."" So they give him a donation. ""No, you must give more,"" and more and more. So the people think that the devotees are only interested in getting money and they get a bad impression that ISKCON is a money making movement.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We're selling one half a million large size books each year.; The thing is that the materialists will always find that. They see the devotees and we say that we renounce everything, but they don't understand that renunciation means to take everything and give it to Kṛṣṇa . So when... Just like that time there was such a great commotion when we hired that Rolls Royce to take Your Divine Grace from the airport to the temple. So in the papers they didn't put anything that you said. They simply put ""His Divine Grace is arriving in a Rolls Royce."" So this is the general attitude of the common mass of people.",Prabhupāda," That is envious. So if they sell books, so that is making Kṛṣṇa unpopular?"
Bhūrijana,But one must learn to be a good book salesman I think.,Prabhupāda," But selling book, Kṛṣṇa , does it mean that the booksellers are creating unpopular opinion? Does it mean?"
Bhūrijana,"Automatically, no.",Prabhupāda," When you say that they're making enemies because they're pushing this, what is wrong there? Actually, I can so far understand that you do not like to sell books, or you cannot sell books."
Bhūrijana,Actually I've never really tried.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Bhūrijana,I've never really attempted very much.,Prabhupāda, Those who are selling books you think of them they're not very advanced.
Bhūrijana,I don't think they can do it for very long.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Bhūrijana,I don't think that they can continue for a very long time if they are not advanced.,Prabhupāda, But actually they're doing. So why do you say they cannot continue long?
Hari-sauri; Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Hari - sauri : No, he's saying that if they weren't..., that they must be advanced actually if you look at it in the proper perspective. The ones that are continually distributing, they, they must be advanced. Otherwise one could not do it for a very long time.; When people... Often used to make me angry when people would collect money for..., using lying terms and say that they're collecting money for the welfare center here, or to feed the children here, or to bus the children there, and they'd collect money like that but it wasn't very straight forward.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda has many times given the instruction to the devotees that they should try as much as possible to distribute the books on their own merit. [break] ...wanting this knowledge.; But they... [break] ...so much (indistinct) is collecting, not distributing books.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No, but the point is that Prabhupāda's instruction is there.; But all the devotees want to hear is Prabhupāda also said ""by hook or by crook.""; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Sometimes it may be required to interest someone in a book, that they may find out their interest. Just like people are interested in philanthropic activity.",Prabhupāda, Just like our... What is his name?
Hari-sauri,Hari - sauri : Tripurāri? (laughter),Prabhupāda," Some lady inquired, ""Is there any instruction about the power shortage?"" ""Oh, yes."" (laughs) So she purchased, and the next day she said, ""There is nothing about power."" So suppose Tripurāri has sold one book. The lady inquired, ""Is there any basic instruction about power shortage?"" And he said, ""Yes."" So you think it is wrong. That is your version."
Bhūrijana,I think a simple lie like that is not bad.,Prabhupāda," But a devotee's view is that whatever may be her inquiry, if she purchases one book, she'll be benefited. This is the point. But you, as big moralist, you, (laughs) you think that he has cheated. He has not cheated. He has benefited her. Somehow or other he has given a book to her. Someday she'll read and she'll benefit. But you people, you think that why we should sell like that, that, ""Yes, there is some solution of power shortage."" Actually there is, but you think that he has lied. Just like there are sometimes the father's child is suffering from fever. So the father wants that the child may take the medicine, and promises, ""You take the medicine. I'll give you this cake."" The purpose is not to give the cake actually. The purpose is the child may take the medicine. That is the purpose. But when the father promises that ""If you take the medicine I'll give you the cake."" But cake is dangerous for the child who is suffering from fever, but still the father allures him. ""If you take the medicine and I'll give you cake."" So is the father wrong or right?"
Bhūrijana,No.,Prabhupāda," Similarly, similarly, if somehow or other one can sell one book to a person it is good for him. Don't take how he is selling, but he's giving the book to that person and he's paying something and that is good. But big moralist, they cannot understand. They'll see, ""Why the father has spoken lie to his son. He's not a good father."" They'll mistake. Father is always friend. Father cannot be enemy. But for the benefit of the rascal child sometimes he has to say like that. That ""If you take the medicine I'll give you cake."" So those who are mundane moralist, they cannot understand this thing, because they are mundane platform. The another example is that Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja . He was asked by Kṛṣṇa that ""You speak lie to Dronācārya that 'Your son is dead.' "" Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja refused. For this he had to see hell. He was more moralist than Kṛṣṇa . For this moral activity he had to visit hell. This philosophy cannot be understood by neophyte devotees. Our purpose is why we are pushing so much this sales of books. Because our missionary activities will be very widely known. That we want. Somehow or other let him purchase a book. That is our mission. There is no question of transgressing moral principles. Arjuna . Arjuna was arguing with Kṛṣṇa that this killing of my relatives, it is horrible, abominable. Better I beg and maintain myself than I kill my relatives and become a king. Did he not say? That is ordinary man's argument. But as Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja refused to speak lie, [break] Arjuna in spite of his conviction that it is sinful to kill my relatives, he still agreed to kill. Why?"
Bhūrijana,"That is supreme moral, Kṛṣṇa's desire.",Prabhupāda," What Kṛṣṇa desires, if one dies, he's above all this material. But it should not be manufactured. The thing is that our spiritual master wants to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he has repeatedly stressed to distribute books, we shall distribute books by any means, that is good. That is good. And if you become moralist that, ""Oh, they're taking this means, that means for selling of book, so I'm big moralist. I'm bigger than him."""
Bhūrijana,I don't think there is so much enmity because of the books themselves.,Prabhupāda," No, I think that.. I do not know what they are doing, but I have information that they're not selling books."
Bhūrijana,Some I think. I think some.,Prabhupāda, But not...
Bhūrijana,Comparable amount.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Others who were transgressing the moral principle, they were selling more books. And those who are big moralists, they could not."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They're also distributing one pamphlet printed by Siddha -svarūpānanda. Then if they like they can buy one of Prabhupāda's books. Prabhupāda's book comes second.,Prabhupāda, Sometimes I've heard so many things.
Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Bhūrijana,But they give those away for free. I mean just in the sense that someone maybe doesn't want to purchase anything. So they give him something for free about Kṛṣṇa .; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : First they do that.; Only because it's free. Not that a... As far as I know.,Prabhupāda," They get knowledge free, then why they should purchase? If you give them the opportunity that we take material, knowledge free then why they will purchase?"
Bhūrijana,"If we can become Kṛṣṇa conscious without following the rules and regulations, why follow the rules and regulations? That's what I was thinking a while ago.",Prabhupāda," They should follow what their spiritual master says. Book selling, there is no question of moral and immoral. They must sell. Just like in fighting. Where there is fight, the soldiers, to gain victory, there is no question of moral and immoral. He must."
Bhūrijana,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, but I think the thing I understand least, is that if they are not doing what you want... I mean... I'm sitting before you now and you're telling me and I'm listening, and you are my spiritual master. I must accept.",Prabhupāda," We want that book selling must be increased as much as possible. This we want. The same thing. Let the child take medicine. Never mind the father is speaking lies. That is... Because as soon as he takes the medicine he'll be benefited. End justifies the means. End is that everyone should have a Kṛṣṇa literature. Doesn't matter what is the means. Because he has taken one Kṛṣṇa literature, that justifies everything. This is the principle."
Bhūrijana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Hari-sauri; Bhūrijana; Hari-sauri; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Hari-sauri,"How about just collecting without giving any literature? Just collecting. Three months ago I saw it in Australia, with a lying line too. Not telling the truth. And that wasn't very long ago.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : (indistinct); Hari - sauri : Sometimes the devotees are just distributing incense.; Nothing.; Hari - sauri : They collect and distribute incense. Sometimes they don't distribute books.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Maybe they have to pay off a loan on the temple. All the devotees are well aware that Prabhupāda's books have first priority. Everyone knows it. The consciousness is very (indistinct) It's not a consciousness of giving.; Hari - sauri : Prabhupāda's point is that if you see fault with the method of implementing the spiritual master's instructions, you'll fail to follow the instructions.",Prabhupāda," No the point is not that they have not done any wrong. Don't think like that. But my point, that is, my instruction is sell books."
Bhūrijana,"I understand. In other words if you think they're doing it wrong, you do it better. If you see the wrong thing... But do it. Make sure you do it, but do it without the wrong thing.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhūrijana,I feel that this is...,Prabhupāda," Besides that, if you do not take to Deity worship, then you shall remain unclean. That's a fact. (end)"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : 5,000 copies each.",Prabhupāda," Yes, if possible, minimum 1,000."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Last time we were speaking, I was mentioning to you that in Russia they are particularly inclined towards an exchange program of books, where we give our books and they will give some useless books.",Prabhupāda," (indistinct), why should we do this?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You mentioned last time you will throw them away.,Prabhupāda, For us there is no readable books in the whole world.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda, We cannot waste our time.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, of course. But is there any, I mean, of course we would like to...",Prabhupāda," But only some of the authorized books, just to take their parts(indistinct) and to refute, otherwise, we haven't got to take lesson from anyone."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda," This is a fact. All rascal speculators, what value they have got?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Supposing there are many thousands of libraries in Russia and they are agreeable to placing say one of our books of each book in each of the libraries, but they are not willing to purchase all these books, but they are willing to give us some books in exchange, will we make this sacrifice? Because it will represent a loss of money?",Prabhupāda," No, if you can arrange for selling those (books) at any cost."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We can arrange to sell our books to them at any cost?,Prabhupāda," No, no, exchange."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We can sell, there is some set resale value. Then we can realize some money.",Prabhupāda," Yes, then it is alright."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They'll have value. There will be some money. We can request them to send some samples of the books that they will return to us. Then we can...,Prabhupāda," Find out cost. Some shopkeepers, stores. Some return. If we can get our cost price of the books."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We should get cost price.,Prabhupāda," Not should, but must as far as possible."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : I've heard that in Russia the people are so eager to read imported literature that any literature appears they immediately buy it.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There's a black market going on in Russia, particularly black market on books. Books are smuggled into the country and sold and they're very dearly read. People are very anxious.",Prabhupāda, Yes. They must be because they are keeping in darkness.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," These nasty countries, in the name of giving them material facility, they'll kill them, even they're independent. Such a horrible country. How people can tolerate loss of independence? It is very horrible. I am sitting here 24 hours, this is another thing, but if I understand that I cannot go out, I have to sit down here, oh it is horrible. It is a horrible condition. Simply this impression that I have to keep myself within this room, although I am keeping myself, I am not going, only for walk maybe. But if the impression is that I cannot go out from this room, then my life is lost. This is psychology. So, they are keeping their young men. They are not allowed to go out of the country, in Russia. Similarly in China."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Even more so.,Prabhupāda," So what kind of government it is? It is a horrible government. And they are hackney only in literature. These communist country, the people are forced to accept the government regulation. And that is all bad. I have seen in Moscow, generally the people are morose, their face not very happy. They are also Europeans, they want freedom to go here and there (indistinct) and to work. The taxi driver-first of all there is scarcity of taxi, you can not get taxi..."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Even in Moscow, big city.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That Professor Kotofsky, I asked him, ""Please arrange for a taxi."" (indistinct) ""Well, Swamiji, this is Moscow."" So he came down to the gate —he was very virtuous—he showed me, ""You go this way, actually there was 3 or 4 lane then you find a short lane , then you go this way, this way, then you get to your hotel. He showed me some short cut, personally. They... He could not call a taxi. And somewhere we went, we got a taxi, private taxi, and that man was begging for more than the fare."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That means the system...,Prabhupāda," ""Can you not give me little more?"""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That means the system is a failure.,Prabhupāda," And then I could understand. And they have got that there is tourist bus, taking here and there, that bus is third class. Even less opulent than in India."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : How many days were you there?,Prabhupāda, One week.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Short. You were only in Moscow?; Guru - kṛpā : That is the rich city. People are fighting to get into that city, they only allow so many people to live there.",Prabhupāda, Everything restricted.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : You cannot just decide to move to Moscow. You cannot do that. You must take permission from the government to live in Moscow.,Prabhupāda," Everything..., and we could not get nice food. There was no nice rice, wheat, fruit, flour, nothing. Fruit means the strawberries. I don't remember we could get any other fruit."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Perhaps you went at a bad season.,Prabhupāda," No, no. Everything is controlled. Whatever government will give you, they have to accept. And all the stores, it is just like, what is called? The old?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Grocery store?,Prabhupāda," Antique, antique, antique shop. That means no purchaser. People have no p..., no bank. People have no money, simply bare necessities of life their government supplies. And bus transport, buses standing in one place, best time, and people are running after.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Or bicycles.,Prabhupāda," Bicycle, I did not..."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : I think they must all wear the same clothes.,Prabhupāda," I did not study so much. Yes, there is no gorgeousness."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In China they all wear the same clothes. Whatever you saw in Russia, China is ten times more oppressive. It is much more oppressive. They say that Russia is a complete failure, because they are allowing so much looseness. The Chinese are accusing the Russians of being very loose and very capitalistic inclined. China is very dissatisfied that Russians have given up the principles of Marx and they have taken after the western ways. Preferring one group above another group.",Prabhupāda," Because Russia was afraid of another revolution. People were preparing. So much pressure, intolerance, after all they are Europeans, so there was a chance of revolution."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Especially after Stalin. So many people were killed and sent to prison camps. That was the way that they enforced...,Prabhupāda, Stalin is calculated to be greatest criminal in the world. He has killed so many men. All rogues. We were taken through the neighborhood of all aristocratic men who were killed in the revolution.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : While reading about China, one of the books I was reading also described Cambodia, Vietnam and Korea. And the recent histories of these countries are so horrible, that the... Mostly in that part of the world now they have become totally anti -American. They are very, very anti -American because of what the Ameri... The Americans have simply gone there and...; Guru - kṛpā : Not Korea.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Huh ?",Prabhupāda, (indistinct)

He's left. He's in Japan .",Prabhupāda, Oh. He could not do anything?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : I don't know, he has left there. He went for 3 weeks and left. Now he's in Japan . I don't know where. He's doing something.",Prabhupāda," If he could not do anything, he can come back to America. What do you think?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I think that it's good for him to come back to America. He's been away from America for 5 or 6 years now.,Prabhupāda," Yes, let him come back."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He can preach in colleges. It would be a very purifying experience. Being by oneself for so long in that part of the world is very difficult.,Prabhupāda, To remain alone is risky. (pause) Now China wants to control India.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And also Russia.,Prabhupāda," Also Russia. China would have attacked, they once attempted, American equipment. They are thinking, that because the officers are corrupt, the people are dissatisfied and if we go, they will welcome."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Exactly correct. Oh yes, it's a perfect analysis.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They believe that the... Of course it's a fact, the leaders are very corrupt, but the people want the change, that's what they believe. ""And if we go, the people will work with us and overthrow this government and establish a true communistic government, a government for all the benefit the people."" That's their idea. They feel that way about the whole world, the Chinese. They feel in America also—of course that's nonsense—but they think like that. That in America there is a huge working class and the working class are feeling oppressed. But that's nonsense.",Prabhupāda, I think American working class are paid more than any country.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The average income in the United States now...; Guru - kṛpā : You know a man who lays bricks, a brick layer, in India he gets paid 10 rupees a day...",Prabhupāda, Utmost.

TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, twelve dollars an hour.; Guru - kṛpā : So one hundred dollars a day.",Prabhupāda," Oh, it is impossible to engage."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh yeah, very expensive.; Guru - kṛpā : Construction worker, just to build a simple building, they charge construction about nine dollars an hour, every man, minimum, unskilled man, nine dollars an hour.",Prabhupāda," Then, how it will be possible?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We were discussing this. The way to do it, is that you get some person... There are many persons all over the country who are knowledgeable, who can do the work, but who are friendly. Just like in many temples that I visited, they have people, professionals who are working, but they are young men and because they are friendly towards our society, they'll do the work for less money. I'm sure that there are people who can be found like that here.",Prabhupāda," American devotee, Asian, and Australian devotee."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : I think it can be done amongst our devotees.,Prabhupāda," Mm. We are not very anxious to get done immediately, we shall do slowly."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : So we are, me and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa , we have organized the saṅkīrtana here. The saṅkīrtana should increase about ten times. Before they were doing three hundred dollars a day, now they should be doing at about one thousand three hundred dollars a day.",Prabhupāda, That is nice.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Therefore I think if we have profit, fifty percent can go for books, and fifty percent can be banked. And when they have enough money, then we can build the temple. But it's the only question...",Prabhupāda," No, with what, whatever collection is there, fifty percent, go on. Why wait?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : And what about my collections in Japan ?,Prabhupāda, We also spent here for the time.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : 'Cause I will be getting nice collections this year.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : I will bank it here?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : It should come here?,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."

Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Oh, it's bigger.",Prabhupāda, Bigger?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Yes. And they say these neighbors back here are the ones that do all the complaining. So some were expressing that this might be better, they could come in off the street. Also, many tourists come to Hawaii, and if we make it very nice, then they can, many tourist buses may come here to see the temple. So if it is near the gate then you'll come right out. But it's just that I have no knowledge how to build anything.",Prabhupāda, So?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Myself, how to go about it. I don't have any experience or knowledge of that.",Prabhupāda," No, you have no experience. I know, so that Australian boy who works constantly, there is one temple,..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Guru-kṛpā,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Bhāskara .; Guru - kṛpā : Bhāskara , yeah he's in New York.",Prabhupāda, He can come and help.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I remember they were doing the first, ground floor, I think you told them to.",Prabhupāda, They are completing.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What about the other side?,Prabhupāda, That side also scheduled to begin.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And Bombay also has to be finished.,Prabhupāda, Mm.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So sufficient funds have to be sent for completing Bombay in 10 months' time and for those 2 buildings in Māyāpura.,Prabhupāda," Bombay, the slab is late, temple. Latest letter?"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Yeah.,Prabhupāda, Very nice. And the tower (indistinct). I think it will be finished earlier.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Any more news on the attempt of the government to take it back?,Prabhupāda," The government, I know it will be unable to take. They can not acquire temple, there is no such law. And even they acquire we shall say, alright take it. (indistinct) ...and the Hindus will... (indistinct) ...neglect, all right we will do it."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : A book should be written about the Bombay...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that... One lady, Nirmala ,..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, Dr. Singhal's wife.",Prabhupāda," Yes, she has already sent some article, why it is not published?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yeah, whenever I see her she asks, ""Why they don't publish?""",Prabhupāda," Yes, and they inquire."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So we should start to make enquiry now throughout the world, how to push these books forward. Just as you are pointing out-sending books from India to Russia—in this way there may be so many arrangements.",Prabhupāda, Oh yes. Just find out what is the venues to push our books. As much as possible.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Should I concentrate my time for this?,Prabhupāda," Yes, only. This will be your only business. All over the world, see how the books can be pushed. In their language or in English, now we have got several languages. You have seen the latest Portuguese edition?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Spanish.,Prabhupāda, Spanish. You have seen?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I don't think I have.,Prabhupāda, Give it to him.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : It's on the bottom shelf.,Prabhupāda, Last.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This one?,Prabhupāda," Last, last book, yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Whew, very handsome.",Prabhupāda," Yes, they have done very nice."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's the idea. If books like this can be introduced, I'm certain that every single Spanish embassy around the world will take a book like this for their library. And there's plenty of them, there's many nations.",Prabhupāda," Eventual standing order, in all the libraries. So they will take. And the get-up is so nice."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Beautiful. Yeah, that book is nice, the color is good.",Prabhupāda, This is printed in America also. American books.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Devotee,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Printed in...; (indistinct),Prabhupāda, USA .
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : USA .,Prabhupāda," In this way if possible print in Russian language, in black market."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Devotee,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that's possible and they'll be eager.; The young people are dissatisfied, young student.",Prabhupāda," Small books print first of all, see. How the black market takes it, and then big books."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There is also all of the eastern European countries.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they have got black market. There must be intermediate man who deals in black market."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There is.,Prabhupāda," Oh yes. Get them. Let them make good profit. We want to put up, that's all. And let them take money, we don't mind. Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret. When there is trickery, you become trickery. Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret. Kṛṣṇa's play, those who are plain, Kṛṣṇa is very kind and plain. Those who are tricky, ""All right, I am also tricky."" We shall adopt all the means of the materialistic persons, simply for Kṛṣṇa . [break] Just like Kṛṣṇa's rāsa dance, any materialistic person at the dead of night will be glad to dance with young girls, what is the difference? [break] But because it was Kṛṣṇa's dancing, so this association of the woman and Kṛṣṇa is taken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the first class worship. ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja - vadhū - vargeṇa yā kalpitā . Kṛṣṇa should become a little tricky with the gopīs, ""Oh, you have come in dead of night, what your husband, father would think, and there are so many (indistinct) and saintly (indistinct), please get out immediately."" You have got that?"
Devotees,"Mm, hm.",Prabhupāda," And the gopīs were thinking ""What this rascal says, say?"" (chuckles) They are so sorry that, ""We have come leaving everything and this rascal is giving us moral instruction."" This is love, they can chastise Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...somehow or other, black market, white market, red market. Let them make... And as soon as there is taste, there will be very good demand. And this black marketeer will make profit and they'll do. This Chinese policy or the Russian policy will not stand. Simply we require to make ourselves strong. As soon as we become stronger than the communist movement, we shall finish it."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Finish everyone?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You mean attack them?,Prabhupāda," That I shall tell later. You become little strong. We cannot allow them. Because Kṛṣṇa's policy is, paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam [Bg. 4.8 ] . You have to take that policy."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In Vṛndāvana , one day, on a walk you were saying that Kṛṣṇa's soldiers will walk all over the world and they will approach everyone and say, ""Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa ?"" And if they say, ""No,"" immediately, kill them.",Prabhupāda," Not kill them with weapon, but kill them by saṅkīrtana . They are already dead, so physically killing is for very big, big, strong man like Mao, or this Lenin, like that. Not common people, they have to be shown mercy."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : More a question of revival, for the common people, more a question of revival.",Prabhupāda," If they allow us to forward our movement, then we are satisfied. And when there is hindrance, the person who is hindering, finished. But don't do it now, (chuckles) then you will be finished."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Do you think the time will come when we will...?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Because Kṛṣṇa has two business, paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam [Bg. 4.8 ] . We are for delivering all people. Anyone who will put hindrance, then we have to finish. Not small, big. That is going on all over the world, politics."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Cāṇakya Paṇḍita , he also...",Prabhupāda," That is the way everywhere. [break] They will be automatically finished. Just like the Rāmakrishna Mission, who are advertising that they have got wonderful importance. They are now finished. They are simply making false propaganda in India. Actually, they have got fangs, what is called, fangs?"
Devotee,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, The quality?
Devotees,Fangs.,Prabhupāda," Fangs, fangs. That is broken. So make... First of all try to push books, everywhere all over the world. They have got so many languages, like Russian or... Blackmarket. Chinese also. Blackmarket, they cannot check."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, no, and you don't need permission either.",Prabhupāda, No.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And there's more profit too.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In black market.,Prabhupāda," Ah yes, if there is demand, then you will make good profit also. And there will be demand."
Hari-śauri; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hari - śauri : They'll be big demand for your books.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very big, very big.",Prabhupāda," (indistinct) They sent one translation of Tulasi dāsa's Rāma - caritra - mānasa . It was sold, all, in a week. And therefore they have stopped now."

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Sometimes I wonder that—of course we want our books to be translated by our own men—but in the absence of sufficient translators...,Prabhupāda," (indistinct) ...that thing you see that er, our men means they know the philosophy. Otherwise they do not know, that is the difficulty."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Supposing we have—I'm just using this hypothetical...,Prabhupāda," Any, ""our man"" who knows Russian language, he should check."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Professionals may translate, but one of our men may check?",Prabhupāda," Yes, just like our books are being done in Germany now."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. Yeah, then you can have quite a few books translated. Because if we only depend on our men for the entire translating work, it will never get done.",Prabhupāda," No, no, then get professional man, but he may not create the havoc."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, he must be checked by someone who knows. Whew, this is exciting. I'd love to see your Bhagavad- gītā , the most widely read blackmarket book in Russia.",Prabhupāda, Then that will create revolution.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Whew. These books are very revolutionary. You are very strong. You have put everything in a very clear-cut, strong words. You have attacked everyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, as fools and rascals.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) This is fact, it is not exaggeration."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In your article in Back to Godhead about Marx, you call him a nonsense, you call Marxism nonsense.",Prabhupāda," Yes, what is his philosophy? (sic:) Dialectitude?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Dialectic Materialism.,Prabhupāda," So, we have written one Dialectic Spiritualism."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Harikeśa's.,Prabhupāda, Harikeśa .
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, he read it to us. He's preaching, I think in Eastern Europe sometimes. We got a report. Has he written you?",Prabhupāda," Yes. I heard that, but is he being alright or not?"

But once or twice he says, he starts speaking direct Krishna consciousness and the translator looks at him and won't translate it into the local language. Sometimes he forgets himself and starts speaking about Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the translator suddenly looks at him. Usually he covers everything.",Prabhupāda, He has done a good job.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He is a fit person, very intelligent.",Prabhupāda," So in this way... You are all intelligent, you can plan. The aim is how to distribute books. That is first consideration. [break] In Bhāgavata it is very figuratively described that we have got this body and the different parts. Just like Arjuna is sitting on the chariot. There is chariot driver, there are horses, reins. There is field, and the arrow, and the bow. They have been figuratively. So this can be used for killing the enemies of our Kṛṣṇa Consciousness and then give up all this paraphernalia, chariot, we... Just like after fighting, only victory, then you kill them. And similarly this body is there, the mind is there, the senses are there. So utilize it for conquering over this material existence. And then give up this body and go back to home."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Does the devotee, I mean just like you are always enthusing us to push on...",Prabhupāda," That is sharpening your weapons. That is also described. By serving the spiritual master, you keep your weapon always sharpened. And then take help from Kṛṣṇa , the words of spiritual master sharpen weapon and yasya prasādad bhagavata ..., and the spiritual master is happy, then Kṛṣṇa immediately will help. He gives you strength. Suppose you got a sword, sharpened sword. But if you have no strength, what will you do with the sword? Kṛṣṇa will give you the strength, how to fight and kill the enemies. Everything is described. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu (said) guru - kṛṣṇa - kṛpāya [ Cc. Madhya 19.151 ] , make your weapon sharpened by the instruction of the spiritual master and then Kṛṣṇa will give you strength, you'll be able to conquer. This figurative explanation I think last night I did. Here is a verse, acyuta bala , acyuta bala . Is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa here?"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : (calls out) Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," We are soldiers of Kṛṣṇa , servants of Arjuna . Simply you will have to act accordingly, then you will finish up enemies. They have no power, although their number is hundred times. Just like Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. They have no power, yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bg. 18.78 ] . Keep Kṛṣṇa in your side, then everything will be successful. Tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtiḥ ."

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : In other words, they are theorizing that ""Death is a very peaceful state of sleeping. Why are we protesting so much""?",Prabhupāda," But that is not sleeping. After sleeping you have to awake, and you have to bark like dog, ""Give me food. Gow! Gow! Gow! "" You are not going to sleep after death. You are awakening like a dog, and bark and disturb others. That is your mistake, that you are sleeping forever. No sleeping. You have to wake up again."
Rādhāvallabha; Devotee (1),"[break] ...told me that he was.... He said that spirit and matter are the same. So I grabbed him and threatened to punch him in the nose. He said, ""No, no, that is different.""; [break] So if we have to wake again, then there's no really.... Why should we have to stop birth and death?",Prabhupāda," So you have no experience? Do you sleep perpetually, whole day and night? Why do you wake up? Is it not your experience that you sleep at night and wake up at daytime?"
Devotee (1),"Yes. But if I'm going to wake again, then why should I want to stop it? I go to sleep; I wake up.",Prabhupāda," No, but your waking.... You are going to wake up like a dog. That is the privilege. You sleep perpetually..., not perpetually, for seven months, and then you wake up as a dog. The body is changed. And go on barking. That you do not know. That is ignorance."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : That's amazing. You go to sleep in a human body, and you wake up in a dog body.",Prabhupāda," Ah, that's it. What is this conglomeration?"
Devotee (1),[break] ...wakes up the next morning. I am not afraid to go to sleep because I know that I will wake up. So if I'm going to die and I know...,Prabhupāda, Die means you sleep as a man and wake up as a dog. That is dying.
Devotee (1),But it is okay to be a dog. It is okay to be a dog.,Prabhupāda," Yes. But if you are so foolish that it is okay to be dog, then it is very nice."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : But if we live forever, then where's the harm in changing bodies a few times? We can enjoy in all different kinds of bodies and have a good time whilst we're here. And if we're eternal, then what is the big rush to get out?",Prabhupāda," That is going on. For the foolish person, it is going on. [break] ...land there is?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...farms all over the world, even in India, they have to irrigate the land.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They have to irrigate the land artificially like this. Either they dig a ditch and they pour water into the ditch by some method, or sprinkling like this. So in a society where everyone is God conscious, Kṛṣṇa says how He supplies the rain. Was there any need even for such irrigation?",Prabhupāda, Irrigation?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Irrigation means digging a hole beside where the vegetables or grains are growing. Or will the rain just fall from the sky naturally?,Prabhupāda," You have to work. Otherwise.... This is material world. Without working, you cannot get anything. [break] ...between material world and spiritual world. In the material world you have to work to get your necessities. In the spiritual world there is no need of working."
Rādhāvallabha,[break] ...talking about the spiritual world is pie in the sky. They say that we should just talk about how to take care of things here.,Prabhupāda," You cannot take care. There are so many problems. You cannot take. You are simply crying, ""The problems are there. Problems are there."""
Rādhāvallabha,"Then they will say, ""Well, how will talking about the spiritual world help solve the problems here in the material world?""",Prabhupāda," [break] ...concerned with the material world, you remain."
Rādhāvallabha,"[break] ...put out by the karmīs, and it is a book on how to become peaceful and happy, and it shows pictures of dogs and cats sleeping, and it says, ""This is how you do it. You should lie down like this and everything will be all right.""",Prabhupāda," The dog is lying peacefully because he has got sense that ""I have got a good master."" Therefore he is sleeping. They do not sleep peacefully without master."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that the scientists have been proven guilty. Now we have to decide what their punishment should be.",Prabhupāda, Nature will punish them. [break]
Devotee (1),...kind of programs should we develop to defeat the scientists? Just like we distribute books in the street. A lot of times the scientists may not get some of these books.,Prabhupāda," Defeat is that ""You are scientist. I don't want death. Please stop it."" Ask him. ""I don't want disease. Please stop it. Then you are scientist. Otherwise I kick on your face."""
Devotee (1),Should we go to the colleges and universities and make program?,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...these rascals are being controlled at every step; still, they are thinking independent. That is the difficulty. They are being kicked in every moment, and still they are thinking, ""I am free."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Everyone is following the scientists, too.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Everyone is following the scientists.,Prabhupāda, Not everyone. We don't follow. You may follow.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Rādhāvallabha; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No, Śrīla Prabhupāda.; One professor was telling me that he didn't think you should write about all these things about the universe in your books, because none of the scientists will believe it. So I told him that all the scientists were hogs, dogs, camels and asses, and he became enraged, and he left.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : But it's not so unbelievable.",Prabhupāda," And what is, the scientists will not believe? We say, tathā dehāntara - prāptiḥ : [Bg. 2.13 ] ""As the child is becoming boy, boy is becoming, similarly you have to change body."" What scientist has to challenge this? But they are obstinate dog. Dehāntara - prāptiḥ you have to accept. Can the scientist say, ""No, no, no, the child is not going to be a young man or boy""? Can he say like that? Then why they challenge unnecessarily? They are changing the body. Can the scientists stop it? But if they are unreasonable dogs, then what can be done? What argument will reach them? A dog cannot understand."
Rādhāvallabha,Just stick.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, they will not understand even with stick. You see? They are less than dog. Bhagavad- gītā days, dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. 2.13 ], very simple argument, that ""As the child is becoming boy, boy is becoming young man, young man is becoming middle-aged man, and middle-aged is becoming old man, similarly, you are changing body."" So where is the difficulty to understand? But they are so obstinate rascal, they will not believe. As soon as the child is dead, does he become boy?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda, So what is that? What is the scientists' reply?
Rādhāvallabha,They say he's dead.,Prabhupāda, So why dead?
Rādhāvallabha,They say the brain and the heart stopped working.,Prabhupāda," So you replace it, rascal."
Rādhāvallabha,We're working on it.,Prabhupāda," There are such.... Obstinate dogs. [break]...difficulty. Mūḍha . They are mūḍhas, and they will continue to remain mūḍha . Then how you can make him enlightened? They cannot answer properly. Why a dead child born does not grow, does not change body? The body is a lump of matter. Analyze the body. Where is life? These are all very reasonable. But they will not. Dog's obstinacy. How you can convince them? Simply waste of time, talk with them. Therefore they should be neglected."
Rādhāvallabha,They did one experiment where they took a...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Rādhāvallabha,"They did an experiment where they took an embryo of a child, and they put it in a test tube, large bottle, and they were growing it by feeding it, and it just turned into a shapeless blob.",Prabhupāda," So why did you take embryo from the child? You make embryo. You cannot make even an egg which can be..., give a chicken. So to waste time with these rascals is very difficult."
Devotee (1),Such programs are minimized in the temple. Should there be a college program in each temple? Or should everyone just work along with the BBT Library Party? Should there be a college program?,Prabhupāda," No, it is useless to talk with them. If you can peacefully sell some books, that's all. Don't enter into very long arguments, because they are all rascals. They cannot understand. Better peacefully, as far as possible, sell some books. Dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya kāku- śataṁ kṛtvā ca ... This is the process. They cannot understand that because there is soul within the child, therefore child is becoming boy. As soon as there is no soul, the child does not become a boy. This simple philosophy they cannot understand, so what is their position? Now, this car is standing because there is no driver. Anyone can understand. Stand still. It will remain there for thousands of years unless a driver comes. Simple reason. But they are so rascal, they will not understand. So what is the use of talking with them? Simply waste of time."
