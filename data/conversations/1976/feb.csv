Jayapatākā,"Bhārata - bhūmite haila manuṣya - janma jāra . Those people who are born on the sacred land of Bhāratavarṣa, they should perfect their life, janma sārthaka kari', and help others. Purpose of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to perfect one's own spiritual knowledge and then to go and help other people. So people that are born here in Bhāratavarṣa have a special facility because of the Vedic culture, Aryan culture, to perfect their lives. And just as Śrīla Prabhupāda has gone all over the world spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness—one person from this Bhāratavarṣa has been able to do so much—if other pure devotees would come and preach as Śrīla Prabhupāda has done, then how many unlimited amount of fallen souls could receive the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...in so-called transcendental meditation, go to the Himalaya and go to the forest. We are not interested in all this nonsense. Our only business is to spread Bhagavad- gītā As It Is, door to door, town to town, city to city. We are not going to seclusion. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, ""This is professional bluff: 'I am going to the Himalaya . I am going to the forest.' "" Prahlāda Mahārāja condemns that ""These are professional bluffs."" Or they may be sincere, but still, they are trying for their own salvation. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, ""I am not interested in that sal... I am interested for everyone's salvation. Everyone must go back to home, back to..."" That is Vaiṣṇava , not that ""For my own salvation I go to Himalaya or in the forest and transcendental meditation, nonsense..."" We are not interested in those things. (laughs) And our men... Just like that Gaurasundara. He is doing all nonsense, transcendental meditation. Is it not?"
Sudāmā,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Rascal. He is doing transcendental meditation. He got so much opportunity to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He did it in the beginning very nicely. A rascal, he became victim. These things are for ajitendriyāṇām. Those who are not able to control the senses, they make this business, transcendental meditation, and secretly doing all nonsense. The whole thing, this transcendental meditation, that, what is that, Maharishi Yogi , they are doing all nonsense and advertising, ""We are transcendental meditation."""
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : They openly advertise that ""If you do transcendental meditation, then you can do your business better, you can have better sex life.""",Prabhupāda," And that's all. So you can do your sense gratification process, yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi tuccham , what is condemned by Prahlāda Mahārāja , that ""This kind of happiness is most abominable and insignificant."" Tuccham . Tuccham means very insignificant. Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha - duḥkham . It is just like itching between the two hand, and after-result is misery. That's all. Iva duḥkha - duḥkham . Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ [SB 7.9.45 ] . They know it, that after this enjoyment of itching sensation there will be so much trouble. But neha tṛpyanti : they are not satisfied. Again and again. Bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ . Begetting one child... Just see. It is going on. (children in background) No shame. That is animal. No shame. In Western countries they are learning... I have seen. In Los Angeles beach they are having sex open. Just like these birds or beasts. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ . They are trying to make birth control. Why? Bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ . That illicit or legal sex, the after-result is very miserable."
Jayapatākā,"It seems that as a country, India's got the best chances for becoming fully Kṛṣṇa conscious again.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Everywhere chance. Kṛṣṇa does not say for India.
Jayapatākā,But first.,Prabhupāda," No. That is not... You are making better progress, Western countries. Kṛṣṇa is not limited anywhere. But in India they have got the facilities. But they are becoming rascals, so they are not taking the facility. The facility is there. That is everywhere, especially in India. You see everywhere, every day, the sunrise, so beautiful. In Western country, some places, sometimes. But here you'll find every day. That is the facility. This is Gāyatrī mantra . Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi . This facility is in here. You get sufficient sunlight, and in sunlight you keep very healthy and happy. That facility is here."
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, last night you were saying, ""The sun is moving."" We can see the sun has just come up and is moving across the sky. So what do they base their statement that the sun is stationary? They have no basis in fact.",Prabhupāda," Therefore rascals. They see one thing and speak another. That is rascal. Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala - grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta ... Huh ? Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala - grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta - sura -mūrtir aśeṣa - tejāḥ . Aśeṣa - tejāḥ . The... aśeṣa - tejāḥ , unlimited temperature and light. They are studied. This is aśeṣa - tejāḥ . If they have studied the quality of the sun, how they can say something wrong about the movements? That is also right. Yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta - kāla -cakro govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi . This is statement. Bhramati . It is never discussed, sthira . Fixed up means sthira . Bhramati saṁbhṛta - kāla - cakraḥ . And that is also... That movement is also within the time limit fixed up by Kṛṣṇa : ""Morning, half past six, you get up."" ""Yes."" You cannot stop it. Kṛṣṇa's ājñā . It is order of Kṛṣṇa . You stop it, you scientists. You make it conveniently. Not half past six, make it eight. Can you do this? You rascal, you are claiming scientist. Yasyājñayā. It is only by His order you can... You ask him to rise from this side. Why from this side? Is there any scientist can change? Then why they are claiming that there is no God? Huh ? What is the answer? Hm? Yasyājñayā. There is some arrangement. What is their answer? Hm? Jagadīśa Prabhu ? What is the answer?"
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : There is no... We don't see how God is working. We don't see...,Prabhupāda," Are you blind? God is working. Yasyājñayā bhramati . Yasya , by His order he is rising. Why don't you see God? It is not your order or your scientist order. Somebody's order. That is God."
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : But there doesn't seem to be any meaning. There doesn't seem to be any meaning.,Prabhupāda, What is the meaning?
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : There is no meaning.,Prabhupāda, What is the meaning?
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : It's just evolution. There's no meaning. What's the meaning?,Prabhupāda," I do not follow what is the meaning. The sun is rising half past six, exactly at the time. So there is no meaning?"
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : We can't tell what the meaning is.,Prabhupāda," That is... Because you are rascal, you do not know. You learn it. One who knows the meaning. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . You are fool, rascal. How can you know the meaning? You must have to go to the real person."
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : Who knows?,Prabhupāda," Guru . Therefore we go to guru . Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21] . One who is actually serious about inquiring, he must go. Guruṁ prapadyeta . Must surrender to guru ."
Śāstrījī,Śābde pare ca niṣṇātam .,Prabhupāda," Ah. That is... Therefore there is guru . Ādau gurvāśrayam. If you know, want to know, first of all take shelter of guru . That is the injunction."
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Then we will ask, how do we know who is really guru ?",Prabhupāda," That is another rascaldom. You see how others are taking guru , paramparā system. You are rascal. You will place so many questions. But the answers are already there. Evaṁ paramparā - prāptam [Bg. 4.2 ] . Guru is he who knows Kṛṣṇa , who explains Kṛṣṇa . That is guru . Otherwise he's not guru ."
Dayānanda,Samit - pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma - niṣṭham [MU 1.2.12] .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, who knows Kṛṣṇa , he is guru . Otherwise all rascals. Why should you go to a rascal? Immediately you can understand he is guru who has fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa . He is guru . Others? They are all rascals. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . Who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa , he is under these four groups: duṣkṛtina, mūḍha , narādhama, māyayāpahṛta- jñāna . They may talk of so much knowledge, but they are rascal fools because they have not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa . All the Māyāvādīs, they are all rascals. They have not surrendered. This is the test. Why don't you take lesson from Bhagavad- gītā ? He is guru . One who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa , one is servant of Kṛṣṇa , he is guru . That is the test. If you want to select a guru , you have to see ""Whether this person is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa ?"" Then he is guru . Huh ? What is the definition of guru given by...? Why don't you read all these things? Why you remain fools and rascals? Why...? We are following Caitanya Mahāprabhu . Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, āmāra ājñāya guru hañā . You become a guru . How? Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa - upadeśa [ Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] . That's a guru . Why don't you see all these instructions? And you are presenting yourself as following Caitanya Mahāprabhu ? Why? Answer. Why you remain fool and rascal? If you want to remain fool and rascal and question, that is not very good. You must know who is guru . And you say, ""I do not know who is guru ."" Why? Hm? What is the answer? Guru is defined by Caitanya Mahāprabhu . We are chanting daily, śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī advaita gadādhara śrī ... Take their lesson. Otherwise why you are praying, śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda ? You, rather, glorify Hitler or Mussolini. Make them guru . Everything is there. You cannot say that ""I do not understand."" Do not understand means you do not take. What is the...? All right? (laughter)"
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : You are giving one version of Bhagavad- gītā , but there are so many versions of Bhagavad- gītā .",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : You are giving one version of Bhagavad- gītā , but there are so many versions.",Prabhupāda," If you can learn one, then your life will be successful for many thousand years. Hm? Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati . You simply understand one verse of Bhagavad- gītā ; then you understand everything. This is the meaning. Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati . (Bengali)"
Sudāmā,"I remember once you said, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that it took Arjuna less than forty-five minutes. He understood. But for us it is taking, for materialistic men...",Prabhupāda," Forty-five thousand years. (laughter) Who is therefore mūḍhas ? Intelligent men can answer, understand everything, in a minute. And if he's a fool, rascal, even forty-five thousand years he cannot understand. We are giving the best service to the whole world, trying to make them educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
Sudāmā,"[break] ...very curious: ""What is the power and mystery of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, how he is doing so many things but yet he does not appear like these others yogis who are..., like Satya Sai Baba who is making magic and...""",Prabhupāda, But why? Because they have no eyes. Has Satya Sai Baba so many properties all over the world? He is creating gold but has he got so many properties? One property like this? Huh ? I started this business with forty rupees; now it is forty crores. Has this rascal has any property like this? (laughter)
Jayapatākā; Bhavānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"He is producing ashes. (laughter); Bhavānanda : Just like Yogi Bhajan came, remember Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Berkeley, and he said, ""I am simply here to try and understand how you are doing so greatly, how you are opening so many temples."" He said, ""I have simply come to try and understand that point, to learn your secret.""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But his idea is that he will then sit and enjoy all of those things.",Prabhupāda, (laughs) Nowadays all these yogis and swamis are going. Even that blind saintly person...
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Gange...,Prabhupāda," Gangesvarananda. He also went. But coming back, he is disappointed. Nobody took care of him. Although in India he is known as a great saintly person. They have no asset. They have no Kṛṣṇa ; therefore they are beggars. Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ . If one gets Kṛṣṇa , then he gets everything."
Sudāmā,"Therefore we pray, ""viṣṇu- pādāya kṛṣṇa -preṣṭhāya bhūtale , śrīmate bhaktivedānta- svāmin iti nāmine. """,Prabhupāda," Not viṣṇu - padāya . Viṣṇu - pādāya . (pronounces with long ""a"") The Prabhupāda and Viṣṇupāda, the same thing. Viṣṇu is prabhu . Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ . They say like that? Who says that?"
Sudāmā,"Oh, that, how they are trying to understand your powers? Oh, yes, in one college I was lecturing in Kansas. Some students came to me, and they said, ""We are amazed."" They were disciples of this one bogus yogi . I cannot remember his name. And they were asking me, ""How your swami, how your guru has got some power, we are trying to understand.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Sudāmā,"I told them, ""Yes, even we may be unwilling, still, we are forced to serve Kṛṣṇa by his grace and mercy.""",Prabhupāda," And even the students are asking. That means it has become widespread, if the small boys are asking. They are also studying. So why did you not say, ""You are asking why he has become so famous, and still, you do not say more than other yogis? You are asking this question, 'How he has become?' That means he has already become more than. So why you are asking this question?"""
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think you are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : You are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa. No one else has fulfilled that...,Prabhupāda," At least historically it be proved. [break] ...cause of envy of my Godbrothers. I was known. Although they knew that Prabhupāda liked me very much, because I am gṛhastha , I was known as pacā- gṛhastha . Pacā- gṛhastha means a rotten gṛhastha . And now they say, ""This gṛhastha has come out more than us? What is this?"" [break] Śrīdhara Mahārāja's chief disciple...?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Gaura .,Prabhupāda," He always used to say to Śrīdhara Mahārāja that ""You are seeing Abhay Babu as gṛhastha , but he is more than many yogis."" He was telling."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Even before.,Prabhupāda," When I was gṛhastha they were my tenant. So, and he used to say. And then..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He knew. He saw you in your activities.,Prabhupāda," Yes, he said that ""Mahārāja, you are seeing he is gṛhastha . He is more than many yogis."" He used to say, that boy."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He has good sentiment, then.",Prabhupāda," And Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya , yei kṛṣṇa - tattva - vettā sei guru haya [Cc. Madhya 8.128 ] . It doesn't matter whether one is gṛhastha or a sannyāsī . (Bengali) [break]...all big, big men, he was present. [break]"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda, another twenty thousand dollars was transferred. [break]",Prabhupāda," He cannot complain. There is money; there is men; now you have to complete. You cannot say, ""For this purpose, it..."" No. [break] ... Mādhava Mahārāja , you can say that ""Have you seen ever twenty thousand at a time?"" And I am bringing daily twenty thousand. Twenty thousand dollars. Not money..., rupees, but dollars. ""Have you seen twenty thousand dollars at a time?"" [break] Detroit temple, you know? Jagadīśa ? Are you going to negotiate."
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : Where is this?,Prabhupāda," Detroit, the temple."
Jagadīśa,"Jagadīśa : Oh, yes, Detroit temple, yes.",Prabhupāda," And he was asking 350,000. So I told, ""All right, you take cash, 300,000,"" and he immediately accepted, though I had not three paisa even in the bank. So immediately... The girl has paid?"
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, She agreed to pay half and our Ambarīṣa agreed to pay half. It was purchased immediately.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Cash. And you only had three paisa . That means one who is servant of the richest, he also becomes rich. You always said, ""Serving the greatest, you become great.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. A big man's son squanders money and the father pays. Similarly, if you become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa , the father will spend for you. Why do you care wherefrom money comes?"
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Just like, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you had Dai Nippon print fifty thousand dollars in books in the beginning.",Prabhupāda," (chuckles) Yes. Yes. I gave him five thousand and I ordered him fifty-two thousand. And I told him, ""The money will come."" And he said that ""Five thousand he is giving advance. Money will come."" So they immediately published Kṛṣṇa book, forty thousand dollar worth."
Sudāmā,"And they told me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, later, that that was the first time in the history of their company that they would ever make any such concession.",Prabhupāda, They told?
Sudāmā; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. Mr. Ogata and Mr. Kugimoto said, ""Somehow by his... He is such a great man, His Divine Grace, somehow we accepted."" They were surprised. Remember when he went?; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They were mystified by you, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," When I was coming back from America at that time, I came via Japan for this purpose. At that time you were in charge."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Your dealings with them were very memorable.,Prabhupāda," They said, ""How we agreed?"" (laughs) They were surprised."
Sudāmā,"And whenever I would see the president... That one meeting you had with him... Whenever I would see the president after that, he would always ask me, ""How is His Divine Grace? How is he feeling and where is he?""",Prabhupāda," I challenged him, ""You are Buddhist."" ""Yes."" ""You are eating meat?"" ""Yes."" ""What is this?"" (laughs) That was my first talking with him."
Sudāmā,They were wanting to talk business for a long time. You were simply preaching to them.,Prabhupāda," Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the Kazi. His first question was that ""What kind of religion you are following? You are killing your father and mother?"" This was His beginning of the talk. ""What kind of religion it is?"" ""How is that? I am killing my father, mother?"" ""Yes, cow is your mother and bull is your father. You are killing them. The bull is giving you grains by working in the field, and the mother is giving you milk, and you are killing them."" This was his first question. So this is a civilization of killing father and mother. All over the world they are killing bulls and cows. In England there is law that you can maintain a cow but you cannot maintain a bull. It must be killed. Yes. When I was a guest in John Lennon's house the manager in charge, he was telling me. ""You cannot keep bull. This is our law."" I learned from him."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Only for breeding purposes. Only for breeding. All the rest are killed.,Prabhupāda, This is law in England? So you cannot keep even bull privately. Must be killed. This is the law.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What is the reason for that law?,Prabhupāda," Bull will not supply milk, so there is no use. It must be killed. Otherwise they are ferocious animal. You have made this law. The cows may be given some time to be killed, but the bulls should be killed immediately. This is their law."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Nor do the farmers actually want to keep them anyway.,Prabhupāda, No.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : They are useless animals.,Prabhupāda," Simply expensive. But here in India they know how to utilize bulls—for transportation, for plowing and so many other things."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Such a shortage of fuel, but there is no shortage of fuel with a bull.",Prabhupāda," No, rather, it will supply you gobar, fuel. Whatever he will eat, he will give you fuel."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In return.,Prabhupāda, In return.
Jayapatākā,But now the government is trying to teach the people that they should buy tractors and kill the calves.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Jayapatākā,"They want to have..., make tractors popular and then...",Prabhupāda, Kill the bulls. They were criticizing us because in our gośālā we maintain the male calves.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Wow. Karma .,Prabhupāda," No. There will be no accident because this..., the acci...You know that?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I heard about the accident.,Prabhupāda," There was some accident, and he was taken to hospital. So he was advised, ""Because you do not kill the bulls, therefore this is the accident."" As if without killing..., by killing the bulls there is no accident. And they do not cite the accident by motorcar, greater bulls. Accident will be there."
Jayapatākā,"Yesterday we planted paddy, paddy field.",Prabhupāda, Oh. That's nice. But this is going to be a lawn?
Jayapatākā,Yes. It will have flower bushes and tulasī around after the construction. The botanical director suggested that on the one end we make a little arbor type covering of vine that Your Divine Grace could sit there and give lecture from there.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Jayapatākā,And the devotees could sit on the lawn.,Prabhupāda," Yes, very nice. Mr. Agarwal said?"
Jayapatākā,"Not Mr. Agarwal. Mr. Mitra , the deputy director of the botanical gardens.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Jayapatākā,He came out here and gave one design. From Howrah Botanical Garden?,Prabhupāda, Oh. He is the in-charge? Superintendent.
Jayapatākā,Yes. He came with his wife and family. They were very pleased. He stayed for a day or so and then made a whole plan for us.,Prabhupāda, [break] Sun is moving—that uttarāyaṇam and dakṣiṇāyanam. This ayanam means gamanam . Is it not?
Jayapatākā; Devotee (1),"Northern and southern course.; In Bhagavad- gītā there is mention, when yogis ...",Prabhupāda, Everywhere it is ment...
Śāstrījī,Agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ - māsā uttarāyaṇam .,Prabhupāda, That is in the Bhagavad- gītā . [break] ...line there will be pillars? No.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Arches. Just like on your veranda.,Prabhupāda," Oh, arches."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Exact same pattern. It will keep the same pattern.,Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Sudāmā,But on this one time should we bathe directly?,Prabhupāda," No, you can bathe śālagrāma ."
Sudāmā,Bathe śālagrāma .,Prabhupāda, Bathe the śālagrāma - śilā .
Sudāmā,Place Him... Place the Deity there and śālagrāma in front of Them and then bathe śālagrāma .,Prabhupāda, [break] ...made so gigantic and so opulent. And we make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate ? How foolish they are. The doorkeeper?
Jayapatākā,"I challenged them that ""Why you are putting Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gateway?"" So they say, ""Well, this was in memory because when..."" They say when Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was a magistrate that he used to go there and he used to watch the local people do their..., do some sports and horse-racing and things, and so as memory they are making there.",Prabhupāda," So you are so intelligent, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was not so intelligent that he could place him. But you are so very intelligent, you are surpassing Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī . So you are intelligent or fool? You should answer like this."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Jumping over guru .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Monkey's business.,Prabhupāda," He could not understand where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura should be placed. You have understood. You are so intelligent, overintelligent. That means rascals. Overintelligent means rascal. Bhaktisiddhānta Ṭhākura, he remained so many years and he could not understand. You have understood to make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura a gatekeeper. You tell him next time when you..., that ""You are overintelligent."" [break] ...statue of..., picture, I think, of Bhakti ... That Sakhi Babu ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Which bābu ?,Prabhupāda, Sakhi Babu .
Jayapatākā; Bhavānanda,"Yes, Sakhi Babu , he is there.; Bhavānanda : Opposite.",Prabhupāda, So that means he is on the same level. [break] ...Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate is the proof how fool he is. He has not shown respect to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura; he has disgraced.
Jayapatākā,Now the government is saying that they have to knock down those temples because of the encroaching on the roadside.,Prabhupāda, Now where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura...?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Will go now? What was... What was your guru mahārāja's plan for where he...? I don't understand. I mean, did your guru mahārāja want a...",Prabhupāda, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's statue was there.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So why was...,Prabhupāda, Bhaktivinoda... Because it was their... My guru mahārāja never tried to bring him here.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So what happened?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So they did it?,Prabhupāda," No. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's picture was there, not that on the gateway."
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : In the back.,Prabhupāda," They should have taken away that building which was constructed, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and placed him there as separate temple. You see? That red... That was constructed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhavānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You mean that school building?; Bhavānanda : No, no, in the back.",Prabhupāda, Just on the side of the temple.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Old building.,Prabhupāda, Yes. If they wanted to show some respect they should have installed him there.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Just next to the temple. Your guru mahārāja did not build because there was something already in Svarūpa Gañja.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So why don't they be satisfied...?,Prabhupāda," No, they are bigger than Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's not their position.,Prabhupāda, Overintelligent.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I remember one time Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to a picture of Bhaktisiddhānta. You chastised him and said, ""What is your connection with Bhaktisiddhānta? Your connection is with me.""",Prabhupāda, Who said?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Sudāmā; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You did.; You did. I remember.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : When Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to your guru mahārāja's picture, you said, ""How you can connect with him? Your connection is with me."" (end)",Prabhupāda," Then, in the morning, it rises reddish. So why it does not look reddish always if it is fixed?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, the material scientists say it's because of the atmospheric condition. It refracts the light in such a way that it becomes reddish. That's what they say. Because it's thicker atmosphere. You have to look through more atmos...",Prabhupāda, Then how it comes so high? After few hours it goes so high.
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, there is less atmosphere to look through. Why it goes up there?",Prabhupāda, So that means move?
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : No, no. Because we're moving this way. The earth is rotating.",Prabhupāda," You are moving, but why you say sometimes this position and sometimes that position?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Because the earth also moves like this. It's going around the sun, and then every day it rotates once.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : It rotates on an axis like this. So therefore the sun seems to go around, but actually it's the earth that goes around.",Prabhupāda," Now, if you measure when this sun and when it comes meridian distance, so do you think the earth is moving so quickly? It is... According to their modern science, the earth is moving twenty-five thousand miles only throughout... No, within twenty-four hours."
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : That's around the sun.,Prabhupāda, Huh ? Then is it possible...
Jagadīśa,"Jagadīśa : Twenty-four-hour day, twenty-five thousand miles circumference.",Prabhupāda," So how earth has gone so quickly round that it is seen, the different position of the sun? This means sun is not fixed. Sun is moving. And in the Bhāgavata it is said that it is moving at the rate of sixteen thousand miles per second. I think I have calculated that. Sixteen thousand miles."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda? Does that mean that the sun is going around the earth?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Is the sun going around the earth?,Prabhupāda, Sun is going around the whole planetary system.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhavānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The scientists think the whole planetary system is going around the sun.; Bhavānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda, earth is also moving?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Earth planet is also moving?,Prabhupāda, Along with all other stars. That you can see at night.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are all moving around the polestar.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So that means that the more we learn material education, (we're) just becoming more and more foolish.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Material education means mūḍha . This is also material education, the movement of the sun. But they are not perfect."
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda, if the earth is moving so fast, why isn't everything blown off?",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Why are we not blown off the surface of this planet? Now it's moving so fast. How are we able to remain here and not be blown off?,Prabhupāda, I do not follow.
Bhavānanda; Harikeśa; Hṛdayānanda,"Bhavānanda : The planet is moving...; Harikeśa : He's saying, ""We're moving, so therefore the wind should blow everybody off, the speed.""; Hṛdayānanda : Why is everything so peaceful if we're moving so fast?",Prabhupāda, Which is moving so fast?
Hṛdayānanda; Bhavānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Well, Bhavānanda said...; Bhavānanda : Planet, this planet is moving so fast, but it doesn't appear to be moving at all.",Prabhupāda," Suppose a small ant is on some big wheel, does it feel anything, movement? A big wheel and a small ant. What he will feel? This is called relativity. Law of relativity. Why you are thinking that relatively you are very big? That is your foolishness. You are nothing, insignificant. Therefore you are surprised when Kṛṣṇa appeared as Varāha - mūrti , to take the whole earth on His nose. Who will say it is mythology? You do not know how great Kṛṣṇa can become. Mahato mahīyān . Aṇu ... What is that?"
Hṛdayānanda; Śāstrījī,Hṛdayānanda : Aṇor aṇī ...; Aṇor aṇīyān anusmared yaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyāt. So He is greater than the greatest. Yaśodāmāyī thought that ""My child are eating earth? So show."" She saw all the planetary system within His mouth. So she thought, ""What is this? All right, don't do this."" (laughs)"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So to accept a spiritual master means that one has to learn everything again.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : That to accept a spiritual master means that we have to learn everything over again. Practically everything we learned was incorrect.,Prabhupāda," It is correct to some extent but... Just like you can see to some extent, but that does not mean you can see everything. You have got limited potency. This is called unlimited and limited. We are limited."
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Actually I think it makes much more sense, because when the scientists say that the earth spins around this way very quickly, then his point is valid. Why we don't fall off or why we don't feel good?",Prabhupāda, It is not quickly. It is only...
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : But when the Bhāgavata says the whole thing moves, then there is no friction.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Therefore it is still. It's not rubbing against everything because everything is moving.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like this earth also. According to them it is going around the sun. But we don't feel anything. According to them. And according to..., it is running at the rate of twenty-five thousand miles, and if you, in airplane, it is going six hundred miles per hour, and still there is so many jerking. That is your creation, tiny machine. And God's creation, it is moving. Even it is moving, you cannot understand. That is perfect creation. Pūrṇam . The word is pūrṇam idam , everything perfect. Pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate [Iso Invocation] . Because God is all-perfect, whatever He has created, they are all-perfect, relatively, all perfect. Just like this earth. It is all-perfect. Whatever you want, you inhabitants of this earth, they are all there. You want air, water, light? Everything is there. Pūrṇam idam . Pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate , pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya . So you are using so much water, so much light; still, it is perfect. Just like the cultivation. Every year you are taking so much production. Still, again you can take. This is pūrṇam idam , perfectly done. That is God's creation. This is body, you see. You have to capture something. You require some solid thing here. It is there. If it is..., it was soft, only skin, then you could not catch this. How perfectly it is done. It is required here, not the whole finger. This is called perfect creation. The sensation of sex is in a particular position, not everywhere, because if that sensation were not there, then nobody would feel sex, and there would be no creation. This is called perfect creation. The same sensation could have been here, there. No. That particular sensation is there to induce him. Similarly, everything is going on. How to fix it? Every body is made... Every body is made according to the work it has to do. You see? The pig, it has to eat stool. His mouth is made in a different way. The tiger has to eat meat; his mouth is made differently. This is called perfect creation."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : And also among human beings, different human bodies are made differently.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. According to... Kāraṇaṁ guṇa -saṅgo 'sya sad -asad- yoni - janmasu [ Bg. 13.22 ] . So according to the guṇa he's infecting, the body is made. If you infect some disease, smallpox, then you must get the disease. There is no excuse."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So a devotee... It is said in Bhagavad- gītā that a devotee is above the modes of nature.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : It is said in Bhagavad- gītā , sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. 14.26 ] . So when a devotee becomes very advanced, does that means that he should not feel a particular, an inclination to do a particular work but simply want to serve Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Otherwise how they can give up sex life? Unless he is liberated, how he can give up sex life?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : That's something which puzzles all the materialists.,Prabhupāda," Mater... They are rascals, mūḍhas. Their only title is "" mūḍha , "" ass. Viśvanātha Cakravartī has described the karmīs as mūḍhas. Karmīs are lowest grade of mūḍhas. And above them the jñānīs. And above them, muktas, liberated. And above them, bhakta . And above all bhaktas, kṛṣṇa - bhakta . This is the graduation. So karmīs, they are all mūḍhas ."
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : There are other kinds of bhaktas other than kṛṣṇa -bhaktas ?,Prabhupāda," Huh ? Yes. Nārāyaṇa - bhakta , viṣṇu - bhakta . They are all Kṛṣṇa , but above all of them is kṛṣṇa - bhakta ."
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Many people in India, they say they are śiva -bhaktas.",Prabhupāda," They are all in the material world, karmīs. Karma - kāṇḍa , ritualistic ceremonies. Prahlāda Mahārāja has described them. What is that very word used? And meaning is ""one who cannot control their senses."" Avijita - indriya . Ajitendriyāṇām, ajita , ""one who could not conquer the senses,"" they are called karmīs. Ajitendriyāṇām. So all these penances, silence, meditation, then studying the Vedic literature, and so many things are there. Prahlāda Mahārāja , in one word he says, ""They are meant for ajitendriyāṇām, one who could not conquer over the senses, for them."" And for a devotee, one who is actually pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa , he is sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. 14.26 ] . Not that a tiny devotee can claim that he has overcome the influence of this world. No. This is called paramahaṁsa . Sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. 14.26 ] . Not that because you have taken to devotional..., you have become immediately. The process has begun immediately, curing process. But we should not think that we have become perfect. That is wrong. Yajña - dāna - tapaḥ - karma na tyājyam . Therefore you must follow the regulative principles. As soon as you become a rascal—""Now I have become advanced. I don't require to chant sixteen rounds. I can do whatever I like""—then he has gone to hell. Upstart, immediately he becomes paramahaṁsa . He's a rascal. He was given the path of becoming paramahaṁsa . One is admitted in the school, he must learn, and one day he will become M.A. But simply by entering in the school, if he says, ""I am M.A.,"" that is rascaldom. This is a chance. To become jitendriya is very difficult task. But it is easy if he immediately becomes a pure devotee. Anyābhilāṣitā- śūṇyam : [ Brs. 1.1.11] ""Everything make zero, all desire, except Kṛṣṇa consciousness."" That is wanted. But that does not become very easily done. One has to try very rigidly; then he'll be paramahaṁsa . Therefore amongst the devotees, there are three grades: kaniṣṭha - adhikārī , madhyama - adhikārī , and uttama - adhikārī . So if the kaniṣṭha - adhikārī thinks that ""I have become uttama - adhikārī , "" then he's a rascal. He's a rascal. If he wants to imitate the uttama - adhikārī , then he's a rascal."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Is that cheating propensity?,Prabhupāda," Not cheating. Foolishness. It may not be cheating, but he does not know. Arcāyām eva haraye pūjāṁ yat śraddhayehate... What is that? Na tad - bhakteṣu cānyeṣu..."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ . The beginning is arcā , arcana . And because he was given the chance of arcana , if he thinks that ""I become paramahaṁsa , "" then he's a foolish. It will take time. The process is there. Therefore preaching is madhyama - adhikārī . One should take to preaching work gradually. When the preaching... Preachers, they have got discrimination, ""Here is abhakta ; here is bhakta . "" But in the paramahaṁsa stage, uttama - adhikārī , he sees ""Everyone is devotee. I am not devotee."" That is uttama - adhikārī . Just like Kavirāja Gosvāmī said, purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha [ Cc. Ādi 5.205 ] . Sanātana Gosvāmī said that ""I am born in low-grade family. My work is low grade."" [break] ...issued that complaint? ""I am the counterpart."""
Śāstrījī,Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī .,Prabhupāda, The laborers have not come yet? [break] ... Bhagavad- gītā verse? Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca ? What is the full śloka ? Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca . That this flavor of the rose ...
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ""Original fragrance of the earth""?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Out of that, most fragrant flavor, Kṛṣṇa says, ""I am directly that."" So if you are Kṛṣṇa conscious, having this flavor, he'll understand, ""Here is Kṛṣṇa ."" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca . This flavor is there all over this earth, but you cannot see it. That does not mean there is no God. But He is there."
Viśvakarmā,"Viśvakarmā : It would be easier for them if they didn't live in the cities, because the cities make it so hard for anybody to understand there is a God.",Prabhupāda," After all, understanding... Therefore they are mūḍhas. They have to understand. If they do not understand, they remain mūḍha . That is human life. The human being should understand that ""I am mūḍha , so I'll have to learn."" And the Vedas says, ""Then go to guru ."" Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: [MU 1.2.12] ""You must go if you want to learn."" And if he remains mūḍha and speculates, then he remains mūḍha . He never gets the enlightenment. He remains continually... Mūḍhā janmani janmani mām aprāpyaiva [Bg. 16.20 ] . He cannot get God. Life after life, he will go on like that, mūḍha . Asuriṣu - yoni . Asurika- yoni . He'll remain completely ignorant about God, what was his function, only function to understand God during this life of human form of life. And so-called science wants to keep him rascal and mūḍha , that's all. Therefore we fight so much with these rascals, big rascals. They want to keep them. He is mūḍha , he is blind, and he's trying to lead other blind men. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa- tantryām [SB 7.5.31 ] . Rascal does not know that he is hand and bound..., hand and leg, bound up by the laws of material; still he denies, that ""I am independent. I can think independently. I can avoid God,"" and so many things. Therefore they are mūḍhas. He cannot do it. In every inch he is bound up, and still he is thinking, ""independent."" That is the first-class mūḍha . Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam [Bg. 7.25 ] . Every... Dark, darkness. He keeps himself in darkness. This life was given to him by nature to become liberated by understanding God, but he does not take care of. He is making plan: ""We shall be happy like this. We shall be happy like this. We shall be happy like this."" Therefore they are mūḍhas. That will not help him. He does not know that. And if he simply tries to understand Kṛṣṇa , he becomes immediately liberated. Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti.. [Bg. 4.9 ]. . Everything is there. But he will do so many plans, and nothing will be successful. He'll avoid Kṛṣṇa . This is the first-class mūḍha . Athāto brahma jijñāsā , the Vedānta philosophy's first instruction: ""Now you inquire about God. This is the only chance. As cats and dogs you cannot do that. Now, atha , ataḥ . You have enjoyed your senses so much as cats, dogs, tigers, so on, so on. Now you devote to understand, inquiry."" Athāto brahma jijñāsā ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's about five minutes to seven, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, We shall go? No.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : If you like. It's a little early still. You could walk out to the front gate today and see how they are painting.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Yes. So let us go. [break] ...says, uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpta - varān nibodhata . (?)Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo. Still he will sleep in this human form of life and remain animal, cat and dog. A simple word, jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo. This is Vedic instruction. Uttiṣṭhata jāgrata: ""Get up. Be awakened. You have got this body. Try to understand God."" That they will not do. They'll come to fight: ""Oh, you are playing mṛdaṅga at four o'clock and disturbing my sleeping?"" This is going on. ""Let me go to the police. You are trying to awaken me from my sleeping? You are trying to make me intelligent? Let me remain fool. Why you are disturbing me?"" Māyā's influence. Kota nidrā jāo māyā -piśācīra kole . Simply wasting of time. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau **. The Gosvāmīs, they conquered over sleeping first, nidrā , then eating. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. What is this?"
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : It says, [break] ""...when not in use.""",Prabhupāda, What is this?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's for the gate .,Prabhupāda, So why it is like that? People may fall down.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In other words, it should be up there in the day.",Prabhupāda, [break] ...again mūḍha .
Sudāmā; Hṛdayānanda,"[break] ...speaking about how they are complaining that we are waking them up. A very interesting story... In Hawaii for one year every day this one man living next door to us every morning would call the police force at guru - pūjā . So many cars would come, three, four police cars. So finally, after one or two weeks' coming, they would come very happily, and they would take prasāda . So they came because he called, they had to follow his complaint, but they told me personally, ""We are coming not to arrest you or complain. We like your activities. Please give us some prasādam . ""; Hṛdayānanda : Also in Caracas many, many police cars come to the temple for prasādam .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hṛdayānanda; Hari-śauri; Hṛdayānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda, I think your dhoti is pulling...; Hṛdayānanda : [break] ...that the people against us were trying to prove that we're not actually a real religion. So the judge became very angry at the other lawyer and stood up on his bench. The judge stood up and said, ""Are you trying to say that these people are not a bona fide religion?"" And the lawyer said, ""No, your honor. No."" (laughter); Hari - śauri : In Sydney they spent ten thousand dollars, the council, compiling a case against us. Every day they used to come and film us and take names. And we didn't contest the case but just carried on saṅkīrtana , and the judge threw them out of court. They spent ten thousand dollars—it was a big scandal—and lost the case. The judge said, ""Why not let them go on the streets? They add a lot of color to the city.""; Hṛdayānanda : [break] People are always asking about you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Hm. [break] No, I shall go now. Is it direct flight? No."
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : It is very far away. Everyone is... Even the guests, everyone is always asking about Śrīla Prabhupāda.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I was wondering whether—I was speaking with Sudāmā Mahārāja —whether it would be possible for him to come and be in the boat program with Sudāmā Mahārāja . (end)",Prabhupāda, ...kinds of rascals.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : One theory is that there has always..., the material nature has always existed. It was never created, and it will never be annihilated, and there is no other cause. It's simply an eternal fact.",Prabhupāda, But how always existed? Nothing here ever exists... This house was never existed. It's created.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : But the elements existed.,Prabhupāda," Elements exist, that's all right, but the format, how it is created?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : They say it's not created. It's an eternal, unexplainable fact.",Prabhupāda, Ha ha. That he is a foolish. That is rascal. Immediately rascal is captured.
Indian man,Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Hindi),Prabhupāda," [break] Unexplainable, that means why he is trying to explain, rascal? Immediately captured."
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : You may all laugh now, but in the future we're going to find a solution.",Prabhupāda," That is another rascaldom. ""I am rascal, and future I am going to be very intelligent."" Talk of presence. You are, at the present moment, you are rascal. That's all. Don't talk. Rascal cannot talk."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Another theory which is taught...,Prabhupāda, So this theory is rascaldom. Then another theory...?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Is that actually God created everything, but after creation God is no lon...",Prabhupāda," No, then... No, that's all right, ""God created everything."" That means acceptance of God. Then we come to the science of God, what is God."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Well, God created, but now God is...",Prabhupāda, Don't imagine. I am asking what is the current theory.
Hṛdayānanda; Harikeśa,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes, that God is... God now is in a dormant condition.; Harikeśa : God is dead.",Prabhupāda," God is dead. After creating, He is dead."
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : He used Himself up.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : No, but, no, they say... No, that's not what they say. They say that God created, and now God is in a dormant condition.",Prabhupāda," Whatever condition, there is God. That you have to accept."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Now, what is that God?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Well, God does not directly take part in the material creation. He simply created...",Prabhupāda," That's all right, but He creates by His energy. Just like I am creating this institution, but I am not doing directly, but my men or my assistants, they are doing it. (sound like conch) What is this sound?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Intercom.,Prabhupāda, So why this intercom? Inter...?
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : To speak from one room to another.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It connects the pūjārī room and... It connects the pūjārī room, the office, your secretary, and up here, Bhavānanda Mahārāja .",Prabhupāda," [break] ...accepted, now He created and that... What is that next? Explain."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Now God is dormant, in a dormant condition.",Prabhupāda, What is that dormant?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : He has no more activity. He simply created, and now He has no more activity.",Prabhupāda," Well, ""no more activities,"" that's all right, but He is active. Suppose I am walking. I may not walk half an hour. That means I have got the capacity of walking. That you cannot say, that my walk... Because I have now stopped walking, you cannot say that I cannot walk. Is another nonsense. How you can say ""dormant""? He is active."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Dormant implies He was active.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Was active, He is active, but you, you rascal, you cannot see. You cannot say, ""Once He was active. Now He is no more active. He has finished His activity."" That you cannot say. Dormant? What do you mean by dormant? Huh ? Dormant means potential. He can act. And He is acting. That acting you have to learn, how He is acting. He appears to be not acting, but He is acting. That is knowledge. Just like airplane is running. A intelligent man knows that ""The pilot is there. He is acting. Therefore it is running."" And a foolish man will say, ""The airplane is going automatically."" That is the question of observation. A foolish boy... I have given this example many times, that I was thinking that in the fan there is a ghost. But the idea is, there must be somebody. Although I was a child... I could not explain how the fan is running in my childhood. I was thinking there must be some ghost. And in the gramophone box I was thinking there must be one man within this box. So this is foolish thinking, but I was convinced that without somebody, it cannot sing or it cannot run. Even one is very innocent child, he can think like that. So whole thing is going on, prakṛti , the activities of material nature... Just like there was cloud and rain. Now it is not raining. So there is activity already. It is being managed. So you cannot say that God is dormant. He is acting because His creation is acting, and God says that mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram : [Bg. 9.10 ] ""Under My direction the nature is working."" How you can say He is dormant? The nature is working?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, just like a man may make a chemical reaction in the beginning by mixing two or three chemicals, but then the reaction takes place by itself. It doesn't need the man once he started it.",Prabhupāda," No, doesn't need the man... He is needed for another reaction. That will not take automatically."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So another theory is why you have to say that there is a cause? It was always there. There was no cause. It was always there...,Prabhupāda," No, it is caused. Why do you say ""God created""?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, we say there is no God, and the creation was always there. There's no question of it not being there.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There was always there. There was always...; Harikeśa : It's eternal.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's eternal. There's no question of any creator being required. It is there.,Prabhupāda," No. Then why do you say, ""God created and He became...?"""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We don't say.,Prabhupāda, He said.
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : He's another rascal. (laughter); Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He has... He is some sentimentalist, a fanatic, religious fanatic.",Prabhupāda," Then you talk. He said ""God created."" You say not. Then you talk. Now you decide. Now he has accused you that you are a nonsense."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He's a religious fanatic. I told him, he's a religious fanatic.",Prabhupāda, Not fanatic. Hare Kṛṣṇa .
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You have no explanation, so you're simply giving it the name God.",Prabhupāda," No, why not explanation? Why not explanation, that ""Nature is working""? He said that ""God is dormant. God created,"" and he accepted. And ""God is dormant. He is not doing anything."" But no, that's not the fact. The nature's work is going on."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Nature is going on.,Prabhupāda, So the nature is directed by God.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda, Why not?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's not. It's moving of its own accord.,Prabhupāda, Then he is another rascal. Nature cannot work automatically. Just like mother. Nature-mother. The mother cannot produce child without father.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Right. Father and mother required.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So how do you say, ""The mother is producing child without any father""? That you cannot say."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, but why are you comparing nature to a father and mother?",Prabhupāda," This is also nature. Everything is nature. Are you outside nature? That is another nonsense. Your body is nature; your activities are nature; everything is nature. How you can say you are out of nature? Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. 3.27 ] . He has got some intelligence, I have got some intelligence, but the intelligence is coming from nature. Otherwise how you are intelligent? Somebody is intelligent; somebody is dull. Unless there is some background, how do you find the difference? Here you see some flower is red, some flower... Why? How it is being done? You cannot say ""automatically."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, we say... We agree, everything came originally from some elements.",Prabhupāda," That ""some"" He has explained. He is God."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, we don't... We say that those elements were always there. There is no need of any creator of those elements. They were always there.",Prabhupāda," No, no."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are the basic elements.,Prabhupāda," Yes, ""always there,"" but there must have been creation of these elements. Just like in the laboratory, you... Soda bicarb. Carbonate mixed with soda makes soda bicarb. Sulfuric acid. You take sulphur and turn into acid by mixing with something else. That is going on."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But the original elements were there. There's no need of any creator.,Prabhupāda," You are already... That you know, do not know, but the original elements also produced. That is not automatic. Anything you are taking..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, we have no... How can you say what happened so many years ago?",Prabhupāda," We don't say, ""so many years."" We say it is created by..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What is your proof?,Prabhupāda, Proof? What proof you want?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, what is your proof of what happened millions of years ago at the beginning of creation? You say that...",Prabhupāda," No, the same thing is going on. Millions of years there was sunrise. Now sunrise is still going on. Do you think that millions of years there was no sunrise? It is going on. The same thing is going on now here. Because you are foolish, you cannot see. Nothing has changed. The same thing is going on. Millions of years the father-mother combined and there was child, and that is going on still."

You do not know what is enjoyment. You suffer. Just like you are voracious eater. You eat and then suffer. Then no eating. That means you are nonsense. You do not know how much to eat. Just like you require little salt with your food, and if you put one ser of salt, then that is your foolishness. Because salt has to be eaten, it does not mean that you bring the whole ocean to make it salty. Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1]. That is the instruction."

Now you say, ""Oh, the good medicine. Let me eat the whole thing. I become cured immediately."" Then you die. You have to take, enjoy, but according to direction. God does not say that ""You don't enjoy."" You are, what is called, ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt ( Vedānta - sūtra 1.1.12) . A living entity means ānandamaya, enjoyment. But that ānanda , where it is permanent ānanda , how we have to reach that permanent ānanda , that is being taught. Otherwise, you foolish, you'll eat the whole medicine and die. That's all. Therefore the varṇāśrama - dharma . Varṇāśrama - dharma means that is real human civilization. There is direction that ""You enjoy like this."" And if you become mlecchas and yavanas, then you'll not enjoy. You simply suffer. You do not know how to enjoy."

Just like state affairs going on, but ultimate aim is to keep the government satisfied. Then you'll get everything nicely. Similarly, the supreme government or supreme governor is God. That is your duty, to keep Him satisfied. Then you get all direction, all facilities and life. That is the aim. But these rascals, they do not know what is government or who is the governor. They are doing anything whimsically, and they're punished. Prakṛti is there. Prakṛti is there. Government does not want that you suffer, but you violate the government's law. Therefore you suffer. That these rascals do not understand. They declare, ""There is no government."" So this is foolishness, ignorance, mūḍha . There is government, he sees, and still he is rascal.

Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : A person already has the position where he doesn't have to experience birth, death, old age, like that. So if they argue like that, ""Why doesn't God give us that position where we can enjoy without God consciousness...?""",Prabhupāda," God has given, giving you the position that ""You obey Me, and you get the position,"" but because you are rascal—you are not obeying—you are suffering."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Just like a hog takes stool instead of sweetmeat. The hoggish mentality.,Prabhupāda," That is God's mercy that he wants to eat stool, and God has given you, ""All right, you eat stool. Take this body."""

This was spoken by one scientist in Delhi, that if a man has learned how to imitate the dog barking, people will go to see him by purchasing ticket. But he won't hear the dog, real dog, barking. So we are like that. We are trying to imitate dog."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Is it here, Jayapatākā? Yes, here.",Prabhupāda," [break] ...fective, what you can see from the observatory?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's why they use a telescope, to make their eyes perfect.",Prabhupāda, Everything is imperfect.
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : Telescope also imperfect.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : With the help of the telescope, then their eyes become perfect to an extent.",Prabhupāda," To ext... That is not perfect. As soon as you say, ""to extent,"" that means imperfect. Perfect to the point, that is perfect."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Limitedly perfect.,Prabhupāda, That is not perfect.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Your philosophy will be very unpopular with the general masses, Prabhupāda, because you are condemning everyone.",Prabhupāda," Yes, because they are fools and rascals."
Hṛdayānanda; Indian man (1); TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jagadīśa; Indian man (1); TamālaKṛṣṇa; Indian man (1); Dayānanda; Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : No, but Prabhupāda presents it so nicely that people will like it.; Especially...; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's true, Prabhupāda. Sometimes you call them ""rascal"" to their face, and they like it.; Jagadīśa : That's what happened to us.; Especially Indians. Lot of people like strong words. This rascal means...; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In America it's not such a strong word. In America that word ""rascal"" is not so strong as in India. In India when you use that word, they become very offended.; Yes. Very strong.; In America they like to be rascal.; Hṛdayānanda : In America if the father chastises the child, he calls him ""rascal.""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It has a nice connotation.",Prabhupāda," [break] māyāra adhikāra . Now the ruling of this, what is called, fog is finished."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Night also.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Night also?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Everything darkness finished. The sky is clear.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : The fog was just on the ground. It wasn't up...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : I saw in the morning the fog was low but it was not high up.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, it is finished, high or low. Explain that there is such-and-such things in the sun, eh? They say?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then why do they not manufacture another imitation sun? If they know what is the composition.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : They're so puffed up that they think that actually the credit is to them for discovering. Just like they...,Prabhupāda, Where is discovering? It is covering.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : They give the example that if a tree falls in the forest and there is no man there to hear it, then actually it has not fallen.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : This is a philosophical example which is... This is the most common example they give, that if a tree falls in the forest but there is no man there, there is no one there to hear it, then actually it has never happened. Unless someone perceives it, then it does not exist. So they feel that when they discover something, at that time it begins to exist by their becoming conscious of it.",Prabhupāda, What is that explanation?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So if you're sleeping and I kill you and you weren't conscious that I was killing you, then you're still alive?",Prabhupāda," You are not killed. Then it comes as a... You can go to the court: ""It is not killed."""
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : They will say that... No, I will say. I will take the part of the rascal.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : I'll be the rascal. ""No, actually I am killed, because even though I may not be conscious of it, someone is conscious of it. As long as someone must be... Just when something... It is necessary that someone be conscious of it.""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, supposing in the woods. You're in the woods and I kill you during your sleep. There is no other human being there.; Hṛdayānanda : ""But you were conscious of it. You were conscious of my death, so therefore my death is a fact.""",Prabhupāda, Then in the forest there are no animals?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, They cannot... They are not conscious?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Well, if an animal hears, that's all right also. As long as someone is conscious.",Prabhupāda," In the forest there are many animals, hundreds and thousands. They are conscious that tree has fallen. Then?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Then it would also be acceptable. As long as some living being has...,Prabhupāda," Then what is this? Everywhere someone is conscious. There is no vacancy. So this is useless talking, fool's talk."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : In the outer space there is no consciousness.,Prabhupāda, Who says? The fools say. There are consciousness. There are so many birds flying from one planet...
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Higher up.,Prabhupāda," Higher means it is higher for you because you are so dwarf. You are so dwarfed, you'll find that this tree is very big tree. You see? A small dwarf man, a pigmy, he'll say, ""Oh, it is a big tree."" So it is all relative. What is called? Relative world? Higher and lower, this is all relativity. You are so low that you see a tiny thing very high. It is due to your lowerness. Where there is no tree, these trees will be considered: ""Oh, very high tree."" So your scientists and your appreciator, all, they are like tiny dwarfs. What do they know about the universal affair? That is their fault. They are so small... That, the same example, Dr. Frog, calculating Atlantic Ocean. This is the fault. They do not consider their position. Just like there are thousands of ants. We can immediately kill them. And they are thinking they are very big, the ants, that ""We are very busy. We are very big."" So these rascals' position is like that. If the devatās in higher planets like, all the population of this material, this earth, they can kill like this-finish. Just like we can kill the ants."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, in the Sixth Canto, second part, I haven't read it yet, but I saw a picture of a big demon who was fighting, and everyone else was just like little ants.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. That was described in some English book, the man?"
Hari-śauri; Bhavānanda,Hari - śauri : Gulliver's Travels.; Bhavānanda : Gulliver's Travels.,Prabhupāda," Ha , ha , yes. These rascals, they do not know there is Gulliver. They are thinking very big."
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when there is some natural calamity... Like I read in the newspaper, four thousand people were killed immediately in Guatemala.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : That is also the demigods?,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, greater than you, you admit it, demigods or God or anything. But why you are thinking yourself so big? That is your fault. That is foolishness. I am a big man amongst a small, tiny living entities. But why you are thinking you are biggest of all, you can understand everything? That is your fault. This is the folly of the conditioned soul. He is nothing. He has no value. Still, he is thinking he is very great. Everything is big and small relatively. Just like here if one man has got 100,000 rupees, he's a big man. But what is 100,000 rupees in America? Nothing."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hṛdayānanda,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : One year's salary for an average man.; Hṛdayānanda : A worker.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Lakhpati. Here they call, lakhpati. Lakhpati means owner of 100,000 rupees."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Lakhpati.,Prabhupāda, So what is this lakhpati there?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This fog appears just like an ocean, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Oh, yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It looks just like the ocean.,Prabhupāda," Frozen. Frozen ocean. Means they are defeated; they are coming down. By the sun they are defeated. They were high. ""Now go down."" Now it will be finished."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Burnt off. [break] What is the way to draw the line between the following three things: blasphemy, fault-finding, and calling a spade a spade?",Prabhupāda," A spade a spade... Just like I am saying that ""What you are? You are small fig only."" That is reality. And what is the other?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The other is fault-finding and...,Prabhupāda," Fault-finding, that is another fault, that... vraṇam icchanti , makṣikā vraṇam icchanti , madhum icchanti (?) Just like the flies, they are finding out where is sore, and the bees, they are finding out where there is honey. So two animals, they have got two business: fault-finding and collecting the good things. These are two... Just like creature. They are two classes. Similarly, there are many rascals who are simply fault-finding."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And blasphemy?,Prabhupāda," Blasphemy means you have good qualities, but still, I am defaming you."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So the saintly person tends to overlook the bad qualities and see the good ones.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Like Kṛṣṇa's dealing with Pūtanā .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Hundreds and thousands of miles, this fog, simply by two minutes' light of the sun—finished. [break] ...working. If there was no sun, then so many ships are standing on the ocean. The cars, they are ""bong, bong, bong, bong,"" so many disturbances. You see? You cannot do anything. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī [Bg. 7.14 ] . What you can do? Immediately He can kill you all. Thousands of planets immediately finished. Bring your science to protect them. No, not possible. Māre kṛṣṇa rākhe ke . When Kṛṣṇa desires to vanquish, nobody can save you. Finished. Still, these rascals say, ""There is no God."" Simply rascals. At least expose these rascals. We have no power to kill them, but at least we can expose them. That is also great service."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Sometimes, Prabhupāda, when we expose them, their argument is, ""Oh, you are a saintly person. Why are you criticizing me?""",Prabhupāda," No, it is not criticizing. It is opening your eyes. You are blind, you are thinking yourself as very big, so we are opening eyes. You are not big. You are not even pig or fig. That is... ajñāna -timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā. You are blind with ignorance, so we are trying to open your eyes. See things as they are. It is favoring you. It is not criticizing you. [break]...words, vibhu , the great, and aṇu , the small. So these rascals, they do not understand these two important words, ""God is great; I am small."" They think, ""I am as good as God."" This is the folly. [break] ...English proverb? ""Where angels dare not, the fools rush in."" Eh?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : ""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.""",Prabhupāda," So the angels, Lord Brahmā , Lord Śiva, they are offering their obeisances, and these rascals are claiming, ""I am God."" How great rascals they are. Śiva- viriñci -nutam [ SB 11.5.33] . Śiva- viriñci -nutam. Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā , they are offering their respects, and these things are: ""I am equal with God."" This Māyāvāda philosophy. Mūḍhas."
Dayānanda,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, that tendency to be puffed up seems to be so strong, as soon as they get just a little bit of so-called qualification, then they... Everyone is becoming puffed up, even great personalities like Lord Indra and Lord Brahmā .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dayānanda,What to speak of all the...,Prabhupāda, Lord Brahmā is also one of the living entities.
Dayānanda,"So how is it possible that... We're so insignificant, but at the same time we become so puffed up? How is it possible for us...?",Prabhupāda," That is material consciousness, that you are nothing you are thinking very big. That is material consciousness. And as soon as you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, you'll simply think, ""Kṛṣṇa is great; we are nothing, insignificant."" That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And so long you think that you are independent of Kṛṣṇa —you are also another Kṛṣṇa —then you are fool, rascal. Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam [Bg. 7.25 ] ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : That's our madness.,Prabhupāda," Madness. The whole world is going on on this foolish understanding. Therefore they have been described, mūḍha , all rascals. Anyone who is thinking, ""There is no God, there is no Kṛṣṇa , it may be He is impersonal, there is no personality, and I am equal to Him""—these are all rascals, fools."
Dayānanda,So actually there is no way to become detached.,Prabhupāda, The only way is that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.
Dayānanda,Except through Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Mām eva ye prapadyante . You surrender to Kṛṣṇa and everything will be clear, just like as soon as the sun rises, everything is clear, no covering. That is our propaganda, that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious; then you become fully aware of everything. Otherwise you remain rascal, fools, gādhā , asses. If you prefer to remain asses, you can do so, but we are servant of Kṛṣṇa . We must preach real, reality."
Dayānanda,Even the jñānīs and yogis become...,Prabhupāda," What is these jñānīs ? They are also another rascal, another edition of rascals. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. 7.19 ] . Therefore so-called jñānīs, after many, many births' practical realization, they surrender to Kṛṣṇa . Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā [Bg. 7.19 ] . Then he understands that Kṛṣṇa is everything. But such great person is very, very rare. Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ , very, very rare."
Dayānanda,But what about the persons who may be a little bit devoted but who have not achieved that unalloyed devotion?,Prabhupāda," Kaniṣṭha - adhikārī . They are not devotees, but they are called bhaktābhāsa. There is some signs of bhakti . Actually they are not bhakta . Bhaktābhāsa. Ābhāsa. Ābhāsa means a simple, a little light."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So devotee really means one who has love for Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes, unalloyed, without any condition. Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [ Brs. 1.1.11] , zero, all other, that ""I am this, I am that, I am jñānī , I am yogi , I am karmī , I am minister, I am king""—all these are thinking like that, they're all nonsense. ""I am servant of Kṛṣṇa""—that is greatness. Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya - kṛṣṇa - dāsa [Cc. Madhya 20.108 -109] . That is self-realization, ātma - tattvam ."
Dayānanda,"So because that person is very rare, then, I guess, the only way we can possibly know how to become like that is to find one pure devotee and exactly follow that way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness that he has.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Dayānanda,"I mean to say that because a pure devotee is so rare, the only way must be to find out a pure devotee and exactly follow.",Prabhupāda, Yes. If you try to find out... (end)
Devotees; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jayapatākā,"Wow!; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You want a real planetarium just like in the West.; That's what I told them, Prabhupāda...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Jayapatākā,"...that this is not a temple; this is like a big cultural exposition, museum, planetarium.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Boy, Prabhupāda, the people will pay... Everyone will pay a rupee to go in and see that. One rupee for that, one rupee to ride the escalator.",Prabhupāda, And there will be escalator to take them to different planetary system. Mention there.
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : My father... In those planetariums, they use a machine in the center that shoots out light. My father helped to invent that, so we could probably...",Prabhupāda," So bring your father. Father and son, both together. He is... Where he is?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : In America.,Prabhupāda, So call him. He'll not come?
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : I don't think so, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Demon?
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : No, no. He reads your Bhagavad- gītā every night.",Prabhupāda, Then? Then why he'll not come?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : I think he's too much attached to my mother.,Prabhupāda, (laughs) Your mother is not old enough? What is the age of your mother?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Sixty-eight.,Prabhupāda," Oh, still she is attractive? (laughs) A girl of sixty-eight? That's nice. Very good husband. And what is your father's age?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Sixty-eight.,Prabhupāda, And mother?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Sixty-eight.,Prabhupāda, Same age.
Bhavānanda; Jayapatākā,Bhavānanda : Same.; American system.,Prabhupāda," No, here also, some cases. Gandhi's wife was one year older than Gandhi , yes. Kaustubha Gandhi , she was seventeen years old, and Gandhi was sixteen years old, and they were married. There are many cases."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That was arranged by their parents, or they did it themselves?",Prabhupāda," Yes, by their parents. Except in Bengal, in other provinces they do not take much care of the age. Generally the bridegroom is older. Boy is older than the girl. [break] ...was married, he was eleven years old."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Eleven years old.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And his wife, my mother-in-law, was seven years. Dr. Rajendra Prasada , the president, he was married when he was eight years old."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : (laughing) How old was his wife?,Prabhupāda," He was sleeping. The marriage party goes to the bride's house. So it was to be... The time fixed was at twelve o'clock or one o'clock. So the bridegroom was sleeping. So all the men made: ""Oh, get up! Get up! You have to be married! Now you get up! Get up! Get up!"""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He didn't understand.,Prabhupāda," He did not know what is marriage. ""Get up! Get up! You have to be married now."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So in such cases they would live separately, though, until they grew older.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Until the girl is twelve, fourteen. She must be pub..., be puberty period. Then..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But still, they know who they are married to.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So they don't have any anxiety.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...age was at that time eleven years. So she came to live at the age of thirteen years, and at fourteen years she gave birth to a child."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : How old were you, Prabhupāda, when you...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : How old were you when you got married?,Prabhupāda," I was student, so we were living separately. When she was thirteen years old, after puberty, then she was at... But there are many mothers still—the difference between the child, first child, and mother, twelve years. There are many mothers. At twelve years they gave birth to a child, especially in Bengal."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In America that is considered very horrible.; Hṛdayānanda : Why?; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Catastrophe.,Prabhupāda," All my sisters were married within twelve years. My second sister, she became twelve years, and I heard my mother become so disturbed: ""Oh, this girl is not being married. I shall commit suicide."" (laughter)"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : At twelve!,Prabhupāda," Twelve years. And she was given to a boy, my brother-in-law, for the second marriage. Means that my brother-in-law lost his first wife, and still, he was twenty-one years old. My sister was twelve years old and brother-in-law was twenty-one. In the śāstra ... I do not know exactly what is that śāstra , but they say that if the girl before marriage has menstruation, then the father has to eat that menstrual liquid. Means it is, mean, very strict. And if the father is not living, then the elder brother has to eat. [break] ...ty of getting the girl married rests on the father. In the absence of the father, the eldest brother. The girl must be married. That is it. It is called dāya , kanyā - dāya ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Dāya .,Prabhupāda," Dāya . Dāya means legally inheritance. That is called dāya . Just like your father's money you get automatically. So similarly, kanyā - dāya means to get the girl married is a dāya . You cannot refuse it. It is incumbent, you must do it."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So many of our, the girls in our society, they have reached that age, but they are not getting married.",Prabhupāda," No, your society is different. Now it is here also."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I mean in ISKCON, in our society.",Prabhupāda," ISKCON is not going to be social reformer, but as far as possible, we can help. Our main business is how to make everyone Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our business. We cannot take up, but if possible, we can take up all the system of varṇāśrama ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : If varṇāśrama is neglected, then how can there be proper functioning of society?",Prabhupāda," No. If the society chants Hare Kṛṣṇa seriously, then it is all right. Never mind whatever is done. It doesn't matter. Pāpī tāpī jata chilo, hari -nāme uddhārilo. This is the power of hari - saṅkīrtana . If one is absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all benefit is there. So long in the bodily concept of life, we require this varṇāśrama - dharma . Otherwise there is no necessity."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Caitanya Mahāprabhu you have read in the eighth chapter, Madhya - līlā , talk between Rāmānanda Rāya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu ? So ""Perfectional life how begins?"" This question was raised by Caitanya Mahāprabhu , and Rāmānanda replied, ""It begins with the varṇāśrama - dharma , regulated social life."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He rejected that.,Prabhupāda," Not rejected. ""Yes, it is not very important."" Eho bāhya : ""This is external."" Āge kaha āra : ""If you know something more."" So the varṇāśrama - dharma is a good help undoubtedly, but it is not important for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise how could I start this movement in the Western country? There was no varṇāśrama - dharma . But that did not hamper my movement. Now people are surprised: ""How these people have become such great devotees."" So it was not based on varṇāśrama - dharma , no, because the whole movement is spiritual. It starts from the spiritual platform, ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya - kṛṣṇa - dāsa [Cc. Madhya 20.108 -109] . Samāśritā ye pada - pallava -plavaṁ mahat - padaṁ puṇya -yaśo murāreḥ , bhavāmbudhir vatsa - padaṁ param . Now just like here is a gap. So you can go by the bridge, and if you can jump over, that is also going. That is also going. So to become Kṛṣṇa conscious means to jump over to the spiritual platform immediately. And this varṇāśrama - dharma , sannyāsa , varṇa - tyāga , karma - tyāga , these are different steps only. But if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious seriously, then you jump over all these steps; you go immediately. That lift and the staircase. By staircase you go step by step. By lift you can go immediately, faster."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Even some of these women, they're not married but they are serving Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ [Bg. 9.32 ] . This striya , generally they take it, ""Even she is prostitute,"" striya . Te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim : ""They can also go back to home, back to Godhead."" Māṁ hi pārtha ... If he takes Kṛṣṇa very seriously, then everything is possible. No impediment. Ahaituky apratihatā . Kṛṣṇa devotional service is so strong that it cannot be checked by any material impediments. The smārtas, they are thinking like that, ""How these mlecchas and yavanas can become a brāhmaṇa ?"" But they do not know that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can jump over. Māyām etāṁ taranti te . Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] . Māyā is very strong. Therefore there are gradual process. Varṇāśrama - dharma , karma - tyāga , this, that, so many things, pious activities, rituals. But this is the process, step by step, to cross over māyā . But Kṛṣṇa said, mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te . Anyone who surrenders to Kṛṣṇa sincerely, immediately he crosses over. As Kṛṣṇa says in another place, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi : [Bg. 18.66 ] ""I'll do immediately."" So māyā means pāpa . Unless one is sinful, he cannot be in māyā . So if one surrenders, then he, means, immediately crosses over māyā . So these smārta brāhmaṇas, they consider this thing. They are thinking, ""How a person born in other families, they can become brāhmaṇa ?"""
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So they have no faith in devotional service.,Prabhupāda," No, they are..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What was the conclusion last night with Caitya - guru and Mr. Motilal. I couldn't follow in...,Prabhupāda," [break] Then you come to Gītā's instruction, guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] . And Nārada Muni also says that one must be qualified, not the birth. Just like this Mullik, and we had the same gotra , but the marriage cannot take place within the same family."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Within the gotra . In the same gotra .,Prabhupāda," The same title, De , and same gotra ; therefore it is the same family. That is the proof. So in the same family there cannot be any marriage. Sa - gotra . Sa - gotra - vivāha - niṣedha ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So no member of your family could have married someone in the Mullik family.,Prabhupāda, No. There is another Mullik family. They are different from our family.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are not De's.,Prabhupāda, They are not De's. They are Sil's.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Cee?,Prabhupāda, Sil. Their title is Sil.
Bhavānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Bhavānanda : Sil. Sil.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, Sil.",Prabhupāda," Sil Mullik and De Mullik. There are two Mulliks. Their gotra is also different. So in the marriage, before marriage taking place, one has to calculate whether they belong to the same family, same disciplic... Then, if it is the same, the marriage will not... Same blood will not be accepted. Same family means same blood. So throughout the whole world same blood is not allowed, marriage."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that's going on other places in the world too.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : All over the world. They say that what will happen... One thing that will happen is that if there's any... Of course, this is scientists' explanation. If there is any weakness within the family line—that means bodily weakness, mental weakness, or anything...",Prabhupāda," No, even it is not weakness, it will create weakness, same blood. The different blood will create some incentive, different flow of blood. That is scientific. But who cares for that?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Nowadays...,Prabhupāda," The Mohammedans, they accept the same blood. Therefore they are not very intelligent. Throughout the whole world the Mohammedans are not very intelligent."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They marry within their family.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And uncle's daughter.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Uncle's daughter.,Prabhupāda," Yes. The father and his brother, so his daughter, his son can marry."
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : First cousins.,Prabhupāda," First cousin, yes."
Jayapatākā,"There was some case of that in the royalty in France, and they got some bleeding disease from that, hemophilia. If they got any cut, then that would never heal. It would only bleed until they died.",Prabhupāda, So it is very scientific not to get married of the same blood.
Jayapatākā,Many people ask us what gotra we are.,Prabhupāda, You are acyuta - gotra . You can say acyuta - gotra . Acyuta means never falls down.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Never falls down.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There is such a gotra as that?,Prabhupāda," Yes, acyuta - gotra . All devotees are... We are identified with Kṛṣṇa's family, acyuta - gotra . [break] ... madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me acyuta . Acyuta is Kṛṣṇa . So Kṛṣṇa conscious man means acyuta - gotra . (end)"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : They say that's just a figure of speech.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : A figure of speech. Not meant to be literal.,Prabhupāda," Everything is theory. No practical. [break] ...ten direction. Eight direction, corner, and northeast, east-west, and up and down. So everywhere He is present. So Kṛṣṇa has got ten hands. So my father used to say, ""When Kṛṣṇa takes your money or possession in ten hands, how you can protect it with two hands? And when He give you in ten hands, how much you can take in two hands?"" (laughs) So in my case it has become practical. Everything He has taken in ten hands, and now He is giving in ten hands. (laughter) I am practically experiencing. My Guru Mahārāja ordered me, ""You do this."" I was trying to save my business, my family, with two hands, and Kṛṣṇa took it in ten hands. And now, after making me beggar, He is giving me, ten hands: ""You take as much as you like."" Now I am thinking of my father's instruction. [break] ...ambition was that I become a great de ... bhāgavata . That was his... He used to invite so many saintly persons, and he would pray, ""Please bless my son""—I was very pet son—""that he may become a devotee of Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī may bless him."" That was his only prayer."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Fulfilled.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He was inviting so many saintly persons. That is the old system, to receive saintly person."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that you were not so much impressed by the saintly persons that were coming.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Why was that?,Prabhupāda," Not all of them were real Vaiṣṇava . That was my discrimination from the beginning of my life. I never liked these bogus swamis and yogis. I never liked. But my father had no discrimination. ""Never mind whatever he is. He is a saintly person. Receive him."" He was giving fortnightly... There was one Māyāvādī sannyāsī in Kālīghāṭa. So first of all the father was sannyāsī . Then his son was sannyāsī . So we had very good relationship with him. I also used to... Because father was going... So he would carry gāñjā for him—in those days gāñjā was very cheap—so much gāñjā and so much butter. Whenever he would visit, he'd give some red cloth, gāñjā, and butter."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Your father would give him gāñjā ?,Prabhupāda," That, to sannyāsī ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Why?,Prabhupāda," Well, he was smoking gāñjā."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But why did he supply him?,Prabhupāda," He did not discriminate that this is bad. He smokes, and he had some regard for him. ""All right, take gāñjā. "" (laughter)"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So Kṛṣṇa is also like that if we...,Prabhupāda," He was offering him something, ""Whatever he likes."" That was his theory."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Friendly.,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""It doesn't matter."" He did not know the gāñjā smoking was bad for sādhu . That is impression in India. We criticize, but in India, in every sādhu samāj they smoke gāñjā."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Still?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Not high class. These bogus swamis and yogis. They..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that Mr. Das, the lawyer who came here?",Prabhupāda, Ah.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I used to visit him, and he had one sādhu who used to come who was his guru , and he would also smoke gāñjā .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Gāñjā smoking is not taken as bad in India, by the sādhus, not ordinary men."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Right. He told me, Mr. Das, that it increased his meditation and ecstasy.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, gāñjā smoking by the sādhus, sannyāsīs, is not taken very bad serious. The hippies learned from them. Allen Ginsberg introduced... ""Yes. Gāñjā smoking is very good by the saintly person."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I think your Guru Mahārāja spoke strongly against such persons.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. And from him we learned that intoxication, any kind of intoxication, is bad."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura also was...,Prabhupāda," He was also not very serious, but Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was very serious, and we learned from him. No, it is śāstrīya. No intoxication is good."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : How is it that Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was not so strict in that regard, yet his son, who learned from him, became very strict, like a rod?",Prabhupāda," (chuckles) Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was so strict (laughs) that because he married twice, he used to say, "" strī - saṅgī , attached to woman,"" even his father. (laughter) He was very strict. Sometimes when he would be angry, he'd, ""You strī - saṅgī . "" And don't discuss this thing. (laughs) He was very strict. No excuse, no compromise."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's where you got all of that from.,Prabhupāda," My is imitation, but his was real. (laughs) All these Navadvīpa people were afraid of him."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Afraid.,Prabhupāda," Strong-hearted. They made a, what is called, conspiracy to kill him."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Who did this?,Prabhupāda," Oh, the Navadvīpa gosvāmīs. They raised 25,000 rupees and wanted to bribe this police officer that ""You take this money. We shall finish him. Don't take any action."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But the policeman said?,Prabhupāda," Refused. ""Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Why?,Prabhupāda," ""He's a saintly person. We cannot agree to that."" Everyone knows police takes bribe. They admit, ""Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases."" This was told by Guru Mahārāja , Bhaktisi..., to me. He was talking many things confidential."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda, what is that story that one time Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was invited to... He wanted to get invitation or he was invited to speak and they put so many conditions on his speaking. It was some place.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They said, ""Now you cannot speak on such and such subject."" He agreed, ""All right.""",Prabhupāda," I think there was a Vaiṣṇava meeting inaugurated by Mahārāja Maṇīndrānandī. You are referring to that. [break] When I was visiting, I used to sit on his couch. Yes, like... Guru Mahārāja was sitting on the couch, so I took him as ordinary gentleman. So then nobody asked me that, that ""You are sitting? Get down."" No. Nobody asked me. Then I was seeing that all other big, big disciples, they are sitting down. So then I began to sit down. Neither Guru Mahārāja told me, neither anybody told me."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What kind of a... It was a regular couch...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ...or a cauki ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Not cauki, couch. That padded couch, bench."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Sofa.,Prabhupāda," Sofa, sofa, yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, boy. You were a young man at that time.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But no one said anything.,Prabhupāda, Not very young. It was in 19... Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : 1923?,Prabhupāda," No. '23, of course, when I first met him, he was sitting ground. I was also. At Mathurā there was party, parikrama party, in 1933. So I went to see that party, what they are doing, Gauḍīya Maṭha , out of inquisitiveness."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It was at that time.,Prabhupāda, Hm hm.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You mentioned once that most of the parikrama devotees, they wanted to go on parikrama but he was speaking?",Prabhupāda," Yes. So I did not go to parikrama , so he very much appreciated. There was announcement that ""Now parikrama will start in the evening at five, and Prabhupāda also will speak. So anyone who wants to hear Prabhupāda, he can stay. Otherwise be ready for going."" So about a dozen men remained, and all went to parikrama . So I was at that time new man—not exactly new man, but not recognized disciple. I did not go. So he saw that I am sitting, I did not go to parikrama . He very much appreciated. I preferred to hear him than go to parikrama . That he appreciated."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : That was the same time that you took initiation?,Prabhupāda," Yes. After that, I took initiation."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Where was the initiation ceremony?,Prabhupāda, That Allahabad.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In Allahabad.,Prabhupāda, 1933.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So from Mathurā everyone went to Allahabad?,Prabhupāda," Yes, or they went to somewhere. But I came back. From Allahabad I went to Mathurā , and I came back to Allahabad at my own place."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Initiation was held at that Gauḍīya Maṭha in Allahabad?,Prabhupāda, Hah. At that time that Gauḍīya Maṭha also not there. That is at a rented house.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Did you help to build that one?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Did you help to establish that Gauḍīya Maṭha ?,Prabhupāda," No, majority was paid by one of my Godbrothers, that three thousand, purchasing land. Then gradually developed. We used to pay something. [break] ...before to here?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yeah. He has come many times, Tarun Babu .",Prabhupāda, He came many times? (end)
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : There are more, probably at least a hundred thousand, and at least, maybe 300,000 their home was destroyed. Small country.",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : In my zone there are many countries that are always being hit by earthquakes, tidal waves, floods, repeatedly.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So what is to be done?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : We'll go afterwards and preach there.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : We will go afterwards and preach there. There is another country right next to it...,Prabhupāda," Tell them that if you take to Hare Kṛṣṇa , then these things will not happen. Tell them."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes. In Caracas, where you visited, less then ten years ago there was a big earthquake and many big skyscrapers fell into the earth, completely disappeared.",Prabhupāda, Oh?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : The whole skyscraper just fell into the earth. That was in Caracas. They said that after that people became more pious. During the earthquake they were screaming to God, ""Have mercy, have mercy.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hṛdayānanda : Another country, Nicaragua, just a few years ago there was a big earthquake, and the capital city was entirely destroyed. It was all gone, the entire capital.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I have experience of an earthquake, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Hm.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I was in one in Mexico. It was at night. When the earthquake happened I was completely thrown right out of my bed.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hṛdayānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I was thrown right out of the bed by the earthquake. It shook the building so much, the whole building shook, and I was thrown right out of the bed. Fortunately that building I was in, it only sagged, but other buildings completely collapsed. The building was left slanting, though. We had to all evacuate the building.; Hṛdayānanda : So it reminds us of the Kṛṣṇa book, because in Caracas, when there was an earthquake, the whole sky became dark, and there were great roaring sounds in the sky.",Prabhupāda, Where?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : In Caracas. Great roaring sounds and the sky became dark, no one could see, and then everything began to...",Prabhupāda, When it was?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Less than ten years ago.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Eight years ago, perhaps. My zone is very well known for that. Many times they have these disasters, and thousands of people are killed.",Prabhupāda, So you can stop these things by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : When the capital was destroyed, the president of the country... He is named Samosa.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : This country's president's name is Mr. Samosa.,Prabhupāda, Samosa?

Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : No. [break] ...two British planes came with medicine and they wouldn't let the planes land because they have some diplomatic quarrel with England. So they preferred their own people die to save the diplomatic purpose. Also another country sent supplies to help, and they said that it was stolen. They don't know where it went.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Another plane from another country came, and when they delivered all their supplies they said that everything was stolen. They don't know where it went.",Prabhupāda, Stolen?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes. The medicine was all stolen. Also the government was making many people work hard due to the disaster, and when the people...",Prabhupāda, So they are suffering from disaster. Again work hard. Just see how benefit.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes. And when the people said to the government, ""You should pay us,"" they said, ""No, we cannot pay you, and if you don't work, we will cut off your food.""",Prabhupāda," This is Kali - yuga . Durbhikṣa-kārāpīḍita. One side, government disturbance, one side, no food, and they let them live very happily. That's all. This is their conception of happiness. Tactation(?), taxation, and no food, and natural disturbance."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : [break] ...country in my zone. Many times big tidal waves come and many, many towns are simply carried away into the ocean and destroyed. Thousands of people...
