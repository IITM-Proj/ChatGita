Acyutānanda; Dayānanda; Hṛdayānanda,"Acyutānanda : The atomic theory...; What is the atomic theory?; Hṛdayānanda : Atomic... That everything is constituted of different atoms, and the ultimate truth is the atomic particle, and by different combinations of these particles, different material manifestations are produced, and there's no other cause except this endless combining of atomic particles.",Prabhupāda, Wherefrom the atom comes?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : The atom is the eternal fact. It is inconceivable or it's unexplainable where it has come from.,Prabhupāda, Then what is the use of your explaining? Then you prove yourself you are a rascal. Inexplicable? Why you are trying to explain?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : ""We're not explaining. We're just accepting it's a fact.""",Prabhupāda," So everything is fact. But the real knowledge is to find out the source of the fact. That is real knowledge. Just like if we ask any gentleman—at least in India—for your identification, your father's name is required, your name of the village is required. If you go to the court, then such and such; father's name, such and such; village, this; religion, this; like this.... So father.... Why father's name? ""What is the source of your existence? Wherefrom you are coming?"" ""I am coming from this family."" So that is knowledge. Atom.... Atomic theory is there in Vedic conception, paramāṇuvāda. Kaṇada, the great sage, Kaṇada, he gave this theory, Kaṇada. Paramāṇuvāda. Paramāṇuvād. Paramāṇuvāda is accepted in Vedic philosophy also. But we know what is this paramāṇu also. Just like the sunshine. What is the sunshine? A combination of shining atoms. But we can see it is coming from the sun, incessantly coming. We can see. We can, immediately say, ""This is.... The source is the sun."" Similarly, the paramanu , the atoms, they are incessantly coming out. But wherefrom it is coming?"
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Does that mean that the atom is living entity?,Prabhupāda," Eh? No. Living entity is also atom. One class of atom is matter, and one class of atom is the living entity. That is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā .... Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca [ Bg. 7.4 ] . These are... This material, matter, everything is combination of atom, atomic particles. Either you take earth or take water or air or fire, everything is combination of atom. That's a fact. But we know that these atoms are coming out as the energy of Kṛṣṇa . Bhinnā . Bhinnā means the quality different; not of the same quality. Apareyam: ""This is inferior quality, but there is another, superior quality, jīva bhuta , and that is living entity."" So two kinds of atoms are coming from Kṛṣṇa . One is the spiritual atom, and the other is the material atom. So spiritual atoms, they are many, many times greater than the material atoms. And these material atoms is this universal, innumerable universes. Some of the spiritual atoms, when they want to enjoy independently, they are given the chance of enjoying this material atom. So in the material world it is combination of material and spiritual atoms. In the spiritual world, there is no material atom; everything spirit. That is three-fourth energy, and this is one fourth. Paramāṇu -cayāntara- stham . [break]"
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : If we say that Kṛṣṇa enters even within the atom, what is His business there?",Prabhupāda, Business is to guide the rascals like you. (laughter) Do you follow or not?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : Well, the material atoms...",Prabhupāda," Because Kṛṣṇa loves you so much that even you accept this material atom, He goes to help you. Therefore He is within. Because sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭhaḥ [Bg. 15.15 ] . The living entity has a..., enjoying this material world. So he has got everything. He's a person. He has got his heart. So in the heart there is Kṛṣṇa . Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭho. You read Bhagavad- gītā . Why? Why He has..., sarvasya cāhām hṛdi sanniviṣṭho ? Hmm? Who will say? Why He has...? Your question is ""Why?"""
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Mattaḥ smṛtir...,Prabhupāda," Ah! Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam . He's always trying: ""You rascal, why you are suffering in this way? Come back home."" This is the answer. He's so kind. That is His kindness. Sarvasya cāhām hṛdi sanniviṣṭho mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca [Bg. 15.15 ] . We are talking of this philosophy, ""How?"" Kṛṣṇa is giving intelligence. Otherwise, how it is possible? The same thing, as we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the dictation of Kṛṣṇa —Kṛṣṇa is asking, sarva - dharmān parityaja mām ekaṁ śaraṇa —so in the atom also He's doing the same business. Aṇḍāntara- sthaṁ paramāṇu -cayāntara- stham . Now your question is answered or not? Eh?"
Hṛdayānanda; Guru-kṛpā,Hṛdayānanda : Your question is answered?; Guru - kṛpā : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Why Kṛṣṇa is within the atom? That is answered or not? Wherever there is the living entity, Kṛṣṇa is there as friend. Su - parna , sayujā. So, from the śāstra it is understood, as many material atoms are there, so many spiritual atoms are there. Now you can imagine how many living entities are there. (sic:) Physists, they have not been able to find out the spiritual atom. Therefore they are puzzled, and their scientific research is incomplete. But the Bhagavad- gītā gives them information, ""You rascal, this is inferior. These material atoms are inferior."" Apareyam. They'll not take it. Apareyam itas tu : ""Besides this, there is another energy, spiritual energy."" ""What is that spiritual energy? We do find."" ""You don't find? Why don't you see jīva - bhūta , these living entities?"" But they are rascals. They will not see. They cannot understand what is this living entity, and Kṛṣṇa is saying, ""Here is another atom. Apareyam itas tu me viddhi prakṛtiṁ parā . "" But the rascal will not take it. This is their rascaldom. Kṛṣṇa is giving them information, and still, they'll not take it. This is their dog obstinacy. Solution is there. They won't have to make very difficult research work. Here is information. But they'll not take it. The atoms which you are studying, that is all right. That is material, apara , inferior. But there is another atom. And if you say, ""What is that atom? We do not find,"" ""Don't you find this living entity?"" And still, they are... They say the problems are solved. Just see how foolish they are. He's seeing the living entity, and Kṛṣṇa is pointing out: ""Here is the superior atom,"" and still they say, ""We do not know."" What to do with them? Eh? They cannot find out by their own research, and the information is there by Kṛṣṇa , and still they'll not take it. So, what is to do with them?"
Dayānanda,"We can show that they are fools by presenting your literatures, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dayānanda,We can show that they are actually fools by...,Prabhupāda," No, no..."
Dayānanda,...presenting your books.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Our Acyutānanda Mahārāja says... Eh?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, What do you think?
Acyutānanda; Hṛdayānanda,"Acyutānanda : I couldn't follow.; Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda said, ""What should we do with these scientists? They won't accept Kṛṣṇa's knowledge that there is a soul...""",Prabhupāda," They are find..., researching atom. They could not come to the ultimate conclusion. And we say that this atom is energy, but it is inferior, and there is another energy. So they, if they say that ""We do not find anything except this atom..."""
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : They cannot explain how, in the body, by eating food, it turns into...",Prabhupāda," No, no. It is not the question of... First of all, decide there are two kinds of energies working."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Material energy and spiritual energy. So, so far material energy, they have come to the point of atom, and they are searching out. But Kṛṣṇa says, ""Yes, this material atom is all right. But this is apara . This is inferior. There is another superior energy, atom."" What is that? ""This jīva - bhūta . "" So why don't you not see it? How rascal they are. Jīva - bhūta is there. He is seeing jīva bhuta , living... So Kṛṣṇa is giving information, ""Here is the superior atom."" Why don't do they not see to it?"
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Because they are so sinful, they cannot see.",Prabhupāda, Yeah. That is the...
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Like Duryodhana. Even people criticize Kṛṣṇa , ""Why He could not convince Duryodhana to be peaceful?"" Because there was nothing... He was so sinful that he had used up all his pious...",Prabhupāda, So that is the Duryodhana party.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Acchā .
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : The scientists are all sinful.,Prabhupāda," The Duryodhana party, and we are Pāṇḍu's party. So there must be war always, fighting. And they'll be smashed. Hṛdayāni vya... You know that? ""Breaking the heart of the Dhārtarāṣṭra."" So we have to make preaching in such a way to break the heart of this Dhṛtarāṣṭra company."
Dayānanda,Dhārtarāṣṭrān vyadārayat .,Prabhupāda," Ah, vyadārayat . Then it will be preaching. There are two energies everywhere. The example is given: just like the sun, the two energies working, heat and light. Everyone can see. Parasya brāhmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ . Śakti means energy. So whatever we are seeing, that is combination of two energies of Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa is also saying the same thing. Parasya brāhmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ . Any child can understand. The sun is situated in one place, localized, and his heat and energy, atomic particles, is being distributed all over the universe. What is this fog? Eh? What is this fog which is obstructing seeing the sun? What is this fog? Hm?"
Devotees,Water.,Prabhupāda," Yes. The water is also an energy of sun. Because heat is there, within the heat there is water. What is, the physists say? What is the source of water? What do they say?"
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : They say all the energy is created from the sun, all the planets...",Prabhupāda," That's all right. That's all right. The sun is heat. So the water is there from the heat. [break] ...these scientists, making research work to find out what is after atom, proton, neutron. They're searching out."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : They're never satisfied with their achievements.,Prabhupāda," No, they cannot be because they did not find out what is the ultimate source. They could not. Therefore they cannot be satisfied. If... A really scientist, how he can be satisfied? The goal is not yet achieved. How they can be satisfied? But we are satisfied because we know that the goal, the cause, ultimate cause, is Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...instruction is not blind. It is fact. Just like my body is there, and on account of my energy, so I am getting flesh, I am getting nail."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Yes, they cannot explain how the body transforms into...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : ...tissue.,Prabhupāda," Yes. But explain or not explain, I am seeing practically that two things are coming out: one, the skin, where there is sensation; and where, this nail, there is no sensation. This is matter and spirit. Where there is consciousness, that is spirit. Where there is no consciousness, that is matter."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Very good example.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Very nice example.,Prabhupāda," But both of them are coming from me. So this sensation, this consciousness, is perfect when it comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is developing, in every living entity is developing. The consciousness, the sensation, is there in the tree also, but he is not developed. When the same consciousness comes to the complete perfection, then he understands, ""Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa ."" Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. 7.19 ] . That is perfection. Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti : ""The real source is Vasudeva ."" Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya . Then he glorifies Vasudeva . But to know Vasudeva , you make research. That is one way, going on. But if you accept... Vasudeva says, ""I am everything."" Then accept immediately. The whole solution is there. Two, two ways: āroha - panthā , avaroha- panthā . You are trying to search out. Go on. It will take many, many births. But if you accept... The same Vasudeva is coming kindly ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo [Bg. 10.8 ] . You accept it, then the knowledge is perfect. Suppose I am making this sound (makes sound with cane). Underneath they are puzzled: ""Wherefrom this sound is coming?"" They are making research. And if I say, ""I am making this sound,"" then everything, knowledge, is there. The rascal will not surrender. Ask the man who is making sound. Then the knowledge is perfect. But he'll make research: ""Wherefrom the sound came?"" This is rascaldom. And one man is suggesting, ""It is... The sound may be like this. The sound may be due to this."" They are going on, researching. But if I say, ""You rascal, why you are contemplating like that? I made this sound like this (make sound with cane). That's all,"" So that knowledge they'll not take. Mūḍhāḥ . Therefore they are... Nābhijānati. Mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam . So if we call them all mūḍhas, what is the wrong? They become angry. But if we call them, all these rascals, mūḍhas, what is the wrong? They say, ""Oh, you are using very strong language. You are calling us all mūḍhas. "" But actually you are all mūḍhas because you do not know Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...ment of atom?"
Dayānanda,One ten-thousandth the tip of a hair.,Prabhupāda," Eh? No, no, atom, this atom. Scientists, they are studying atom. So what is the measurement of atom?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So small that...,Prabhupāda," ""So small that..."" A child can say like that."
Acyutānanda; Hṛdayānanda,"Acyutānanda : They are all different sizes.; Hṛdayānanda : That a million, they say that...",Prabhupāda," No, no. There are two sizes. One is anu , and one is paramanu . Six anus make one paramanu . That is statement. Six anus, and combine together it becomes a paramanu . That is atom. Therefore they are dividing atom. That is already there in the Vedic literature."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So the scientists' conception of atom is wrong?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : The scientists' conception of the atom is wrong.,Prabhupāda, Everything is wrong.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : But by their, even though they are, they are wrong, by their conception they are making an atomic bomb. They can utilize...",Prabhupāda," So far you can, can..."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : To show results.,Prabhupāda, That does not mean he knows everything. That does not mean...
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, but he can say...",Prabhupāda," Suppose you, you, if you can make a nice vegetable preparation, but that does not mean you know everything of the vegetable. That does not mean. You are still rascal. Although you can prepare a nice preparation with vegetable. But that does not mean you know everything of the vegetable. That is karu kārya . That is called karu kārya . Just like this mason worker. They know how to set up the bricks and doing nice work. But that does not mean... Wherefrom the brick has come? You can take this flower, make a, what is called, in a vase , can make a beautiful..."
Devotee (1),Bouquet.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1); Acyutānanda,Bouquet?; Acyutānanda : Arrangement.,Prabhupāda," Yes, bouquet, yes. That does not mean you know how the flower has come out. That is called visarga . Sarga and visarga . Just like Brahmā has created this universe, but that does not mean he is the ultimate cause. Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi - kavaye [SB 1.1.1 ]. Brahmā got knowledge from Kṛṣṇa how to do it. What is this? [break] ... āṇu -cayānthara- stham . [break] ... tejaḥ , heat, the sun, supplying heat and water, vāri and mṛt , and the earth, combination. These things are coming out. Tejo - vāri - mṛt -vinimayam. How these flowers and trees are coming out? There is sunlight, there is water, and there is earth. And there is Kṛṣṇa also, the seed. Bījo 'ham sarva - bhutanam [ Bg 7.10 ] . So without Kṛṣṇa , nothing can be... [break] ...there is spirit atom?"
Yaśodānandana,"Yes. The arguments are very convincing, especially this last point about how the plants are growing with the help of sunlight, earth, water and... Scientists only have very shallow explanations of how life comes about.",Prabhupāda, [break] ...such verse. Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati ( Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.3) . They do not know Kṛṣṇa . Therefore they cannot understand.
Yaśodānandana,"In the introduction to The Nectar of Devotion, you have also mentioned nicely that even though there are so many scholars and scientists, they cannot even follow these four principles of no meat-eating, illicit sex life and everything. They may have so much academic knowledge, but they cannot even control their senses. But by your mercy, even though we are very inexperienced in such knowledge, we are able to control the senses.",Prabhupāda," Ajitendriyānām. Without controlling the senses, other things, they are simply professional. It has no value. [break]... yogis, all their methods, they have been described by Prahlāda Mahārāja as a way of their livelihood. Actually, they have no knowledge. They are talking of, as knowledge, but they have no knowledge. This profession is their means of their livelihood. Otherwise, they have no value. Just like a magician. He shows some magic, but that does not mean he has all knowledge. He has taken these magic performances as a means of his livelihood. [break] ...ti ajitendriyānām. Jugglery of words, they are professional. [break] ...that big, big words. Then people engage them: ""Oh, here is a big scientist."" And if he's not engaged, his talking has no value. By the knowledge he has acquired, he can make some money. That's all."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : That's exactly what's happening.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And if you ask, they will say, ""That we do not know."" So why you are taking money? Exactly they say so. Our Svarūpa Dāmodara challenged that professor who came to lecture in California University. He challenged, ""If I give you chemicals, can you produce life?"" He said, ""That I cannot say."""
Kirtirāja,"""We are trying,"" they said.",Prabhupāda," Then why you are, you are bluffing and taking money from us? You do not know. [break] I'll have to go to you, and both of them, I'll have to... The Marwari this... Gujaratis, they use too much oil. Similarly Bengalis, too much oil. Imli, imli water?"
Indian devotee (1),"Yes, and chili.",Prabhupāda, And chili. That's all.
Indian devotee (1),"Actually, Prabhupāda, in Jaipuriya, when they invited us, when we were in Kanpur, all the devotees, for three days we were eating very simple food, but the devotees liked so much. They were eating lots.",Prabhupāda," Oh, Jaipuriya invite them?"
Indian devotee (1),"Yeah, Jaipuriya, yeah, when we were in Kanpur.",Prabhupāda," Oh, Jaipuriya is that whole name? (land?)"
Indian devotee (1),Mantura.,Prabhupāda, Mantura. He came to our temple.
Indian devotee (2),His son came here.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Indian devotee (2),Yeah. The other day his sons came here.,Prabhupāda, Here?
Indian devotee (2),"Yes, to see you one evening.",Prabhupāda," Oh. [break] ...country which is desert practically, but they are luxurious, they are rich. Wife. But they're devotees at the same time. In their country also, they have got many cows. They get sufficient milk. And from that milk, they prepare so many things, milk, ghee and then they get channa . So they know how to prepare so many things from channa , laddus. [break]"
Indian devotee (1); Jayapataka,Laḍḍu. [break]; They're maintaining the rules.,Prabhupāda," Yes. All over India, they're not so fallen as the kṣatriyas and brāhmaṇas. (end)"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : There is a... There is a problem to some extent, but I don't think it should be exaggerated.",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : ...that you should be disturbed. It's not that everything is collapsing like that.,Prabhupāda," No, no, they should be engaged in some..."
Devotee,How can you say the situation...?,Prabhupāda, ...cottage industry. Cottage industry.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, And we can manufacture so many things.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda :: Yes.,Prabhupāda, The engagement must be there.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, It can be organized. The children should be raised Kṛṣṇa devotees. The woman can be engaged. Everyone can be engaged. I can give you suggestion if you can execute.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking that it would be nice to have the cities, city-centers, for the preachers, and those, for example, women, children, it's much easier to maintain them on our farms. That way they can do a little work and produce their own food and...",Prabhupāda," Yes, in the farms they can live and do some handwork."
Hṛdayānanda; Guru-kṛpā; Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes.; Guru - kṛpā : They won't do it, though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.; Hṛdayānanda : They must do.",Prabhupāda, Then you don't allow. Don't allow that. Don't allow.
Guru-kṛpā; Hṛdayānanda,"Guru - kṛpā : That's good.; Hṛdayānanda : Maintenance is much more simple, easier, less expensive for them on a farm.",Prabhupāda," If they do not follow the rules and regulations, then what is the use?"
Hṛdayānanda; Yaśodānandana,"Hṛdayānanda : We were thinking that unless someone is a preacher, he has no real business in the city. Let him go have a peaceful life out on the farm.; It has been seen that when many householders come together in many of our big communities, because there are so many women and children, there is a great atmosphere of laziness a lot of times. I have seen in Los Angeles and also in many other temples. But when there's a lot of brahmacārīs preaching, it's much more enlivening.",Prabhupāda, So now you make some regulation. Otherwise... Attending class? No.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Excuse me?,Prabhupāda, They attend class?
Gargamuni,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gargamuni,"Yeah, they attend aratikas and class because there's no other activity there.",Prabhupāda," No, that is also good."
Gargamuni,"No, they should attend. They are attending. I have... We had nice... Bhakti ... Your Guru Mahārāja appearance day, we had nice program.

Gargamuni; Guru-kṛpā; Gargamuni; Guru-kṛpā,"...a burden for maintaining our temples because there's so many of these women and children with no husbands.; Guru - kṛpā : Actually, in...; Because they do not take marriage life seriously in this age.; Guru - kṛpā : In the temples, they engage the brahmacārīs to support the householders.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : The brahmacārīs are supporting the householders.,Prabhupāda, How?

They were working much harder.",Prabhupāda," When a man takes his work in his own hand, it is sure to be done. So all of you encourage them."
Jayapatāka ,"Maheśvara commented that although all day we're yelling at the men, when the work is over, they are laughing and saying, ""Hare Kṛṣṇa .""",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is association, a mass movement. [break] ...our boy, especially boy, in solitary place, then spoiled. Then the māyā is there immediately. That is very dangerous. (end)"

Devotee (1),"Yes, Jaipuria, when we were in Kanpur.",Prabhupāda, Jaipuria is that old man?
Devotees,(indistinct-microphone noise),Prabhupāda," Kanpur, which is desert practically, but they're luxurious, they're rich, why... But they're devotees at the same time.

Haṁsadūta; PustaKṛṣṇa,Forgiving?; Pusta Kṛṣṇa : Forgiving.,Prabhupāda," Forgiving. Kṣamā - rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ . Did Christ said that ""Father, they did not know...""?"
Haṁsadūta,"Yeah. ""Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Forgive them for they know not...""",Prabhupāda," Just see how much forgiving. This is saintly character. They're killing, and still forgiving. Kṣamā - rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ . Christ is very ideal character, but these Christians, they not dignified him-degraded. So you can get on?"
GopālaKṛṣṇa,Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : Yeah. [break],Prabhupāda," ...how to respect food grain. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone should understand, ""This food grain is supplied by Kṛṣṇa for our living.

We must appreciate that Prabhupāda is approving all of these ways, including how Siddha - svarūpa Mahārāja is preaching, and we must be more tolerant and accept each other. This is not un-bona fide.

So, (chuckles) in India they appreciate me only on this point, that I am Indian; how I am controlling so many Americans? That is their appreciation.

He fought his best that ""This resolution should be withdrawn, boycott of British court,"" but it was not done. But although he was very strong protester, still he had to do it. This is modern democracy. If the majority votes is in favor of something, even if I do not like it, I'll have to accept it. That is, of course, the so-called democracy. That..., we do not accept that. Our obedience is to the spiritual master. So in this way we should... If there is any misunderstanding, this should be adjusted and we should work wholeheartedly, because our responsibility is very great. We are trying to contribute something to the whole world. It is not a fashion. It is not a fashion.

And, at last, He says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . Now we have to adjust. That is not contradiction. That is suitable to the time and circumstance. Karma is also recommended in the Vedas. Karma - kāṇḍa . There are three divisions: karma - kāṇḍa , jñāna - kaṇḍa and upāsanā - kāṇḍa . Trayi . Therefore Veda is known as, what is called, trio. The trio word has come from ""trayi."""

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : For example, there is, as we have been discussing, there is between the brahmacārīs and the gṛhasthas... The brahmacārīs have this tendency—at least, this is the attitude—towards renunciation. And so far we can see, a brahmacārī who gives up his brahmacārī life means he's more inclined towards the enjoying spirit, at least to some extent. So how do we deal with this situation?",Prabhupāda," You can... If you want to enjoy, who can stop you?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But we cannot..., we cannot support it. We cannot support his enjoyment. That he should take on his own self to do.",Prabhupāda," They... According to different position and attitude, the four āśramas are there: brahmacārī , gṛhastha , vānaprastha, sannyāsa . This means that everyone is not on the equal platform. Different platform.

So we're finding also within our society that those who are inclined towards remaining celibate, they're finding the association of persons even within our movement who have this enjoying spirit to be somewhat detrimental to their own spiritual life.; Guru - kṛpā : Gṛhe thāko vanete thāko...",Prabhupāda, Then.

And sometimes the gṛhasthas will criticize the sannyāsīs and brahmacārīs that ""This is fanaticism,"" or it's, to the other end, ""It's just as bad as the enjoying spirit, because you're meditating on the same thing, but only you're averse to it."" So what is the...? Bhāgavata dāsa's question is ""What is the condition?"" Is it better to be neutral or to be averse?; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Neutral.",Prabhupāda," These are all fanaticism. Real unity is in advancing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva ... In Kali - yuga , you cannot strictly follow, neither I can strictly follow. If I criticize you, if you criticize me, then we go far away from our real life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So is it correct to say that if we're not Kṛṣṇa conscious, then if it's not the gṛhastha problem, it would be some other problem?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We'll find something or another to absorb our time with besides Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," No, you should always remember that either gṛhastha or brahmacārī or sannyāsī , nobody can strictly follow all the rules and regulations of them. In the Kali - yuga it is not possible. So if I find simply fault with you, and if you find fault with me, then it will be factional, and our real business will be hampered. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended that hari - nāma , chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , should be very rigidly performed, which is common for everyone: gṛhastha , vānaprastha or sannyāsī . They should always chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra . Then everything will be adjusted. Otherwise it is impossible to advance. We shall be complicated with the details only. This is called niyamāgrahaḥ. I think I have explained."
Madhudviṣa,In the Nectar of Instruction.,Prabhupāda," Niyamagrahaḥ is not good. Niyama means regulative principles. And niyama - āgrahaḥ is niyamāgrahaḥ. Āgrahaḥ means not to accept. And niyama - āgraha . Āgraha means only eager to follow the regulative principles, but no advancement spiritually. Both of them are called niyamāgrahaḥ. So the basic principle is that niyamāgrahaḥ is not recommended. The real business is that.... And if we advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simple method, chanting twenty-four hours, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ [ Cc. Ādi 17.31 ] , then things will be automatically adjusted. You cannot find in Kali - yuga everything is being done very correctly, to the point. That is very difficult. Just like our poet, Allen Ginsberg. He was always accusing me, ""Swamijī, you are very conservative and strict."" Actually, I told him that ""I am never strict, neither I am conservative. If I become conservative, then I cannot live here for a moment. So I'm not at all conservative."" (laughter) I was cooking, and I saw in the, what is called, refrigerator of Yeargen, Yeargon?

Yes, we are businessman. I was student of economics. I know how to do business, and the business principle means you require four things: land, labor, capital, organization. So, ordinary man cannot do that. Otherwise, everyone would have done some business and become millionaires. But it requires these four things: land, labor, organization, and capital. So where you have got these? You have neither land, neither capital, neither place. So how you can do business? I am doing business because I have got all these things. I went to America-land. Then I worked-labor. Then I earned some capital, and I have got brain how to do it. (to Lokanātha ) Hare Kṛṣṇa . So why you are becoming paramahaṁsa ? This is paramahaṁsa dress."
Lokanātha,"Lokanātha : Yeah, I have to dye it today.",Prabhupāda," Don't become paramahaṁsa immediately. Paramahaṁsa is the last stage of sannyāsa . First stage is kuticaka. Second stage is parivrājakācārya. Third stage is.... No, first stage is kuticaka. Then second stage is bahudaka, bahudaka. And third stage is parivrājakācārya, and fourth stage is paramahaṁsa . Therefore paramahaṁsa stage is the topmost."
Lokanātha,Lokanātha : They have got white? Do they wear white?,Prabhupāda," They are not under any rule and regulation, paramahaṁsa . Paramahaṁsa means, just like mlecchas and yavanas, they are not under any rules and regulation. Similarly, a paramahaṁsa is also not under any rules and regulation. He can do whatever he likes. Śāstra is not meant for him. Avadhūta . He is not in the material world, mahābhāva . So that is the last stage of sannyāsa . Kuṭicaka means when from family life, vānaprastha, and then one takes sannyāsa , that is kuṭicaka. Kuṭicaka means he does not remain at home but goes outside home, outside the village area and makes a kuti , cottage, and lives there. But because he is not accustomed to beg, from his house some foodstuff is sent. Just like you are sending to that Sharma some food? This is kuṭicaka. But after some time, when he's little experienced, then he goes from door to door: ""Give me a piece of bread."" Madhukārī . Madhukāra . Madhukāra means the bee, honeybee. What is called?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Bumblebee.,Prabhupāda," Bumblebee. He collects little honey here, little honey there, wherever.... And not one place so much honey. So this is called bahudaka. Not to collect lump sum, food, from anywhere. To any gṛhastha a sannyāsī can go: ""Please give me a little piece of bread."" So that is not difficult. ""All right, take."" Because many sannyāsī may come, so it is not burden, little piece. So as soon as it is sufficient piece, that's all. It is called bahudaka. Then, when he's further experienced, then preaching country to country, place to place, go on preaching. That is parivrājakācārya. And when he has sufficiently preached, then he can sit down anywhere. That is paramahaṁsa . [break] ...system. In every big temple there is shenai.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There's been a feeling that all year their hard work has all become worthwhile simply by coming here.,Prabhupāda," Hm. Yes. Make it more.... Therefore I wanted first of all this house, not the temple, because where they'll stay? They'll come to the temple. Where they will stay? If you get staying place, then you can act your brain and improve. And if you are harassed—no place—then brain will not work. Therefore I wanted first of all the residential place. And they criticize me, ""Oh, you did not construct temple first."" And a temple of the devotees is first, our temple. Then God. God will come if there are devotees. Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyantī mad - bhaktāḥ . Unless there is devotee, where is God? God is not a stone. Any stone is God? Unless there is devotees, there's no God. Therefore, without devotee: the idol, this is idol worship. That is not worship. Therefore they cannot understand what is the form, what is the distinction between form of the Lord and idol. They do not know how to worship in devotion. Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. 4.11 ] . They are thinking, ""It is stone, and God is remaining here, stone. He will never speak,"" because they are not devotee. If you become devotee.... Just like Sākṣī Gopāla . For devotee He went to give witness, ""Yes, I'll walk."" That is God. And if you are not devotee, how you can expect the stone statue is walking? You have read that Sākṣī Gopāla ?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, very nice.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Gopāla was saying that ""You are asking Me to go to give witness. Do you think a statue can go?"" So he is devotee. He said, ""Yes, if statue can speak, he can go also."" So he had firm faith. So Kṛṣṇa had pledged him, ""Yes, I'll go."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I think you also have that firm faith, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," No, without firm faith there is no beginning of God worship."
Devotee,Niṣṭhā .,Prabhupāda, 
Jayatīrtha,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Śraddhā, this faith, means so strong faith that one will know it perfectly well that simply by worshiping Kṛṣṇa , everything is there. That is the beginning of faith. Otherwise there is no faith. And without faith there is no beginning. Ādau śraddhā . Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu - saṅgaḥ [Cc. Madhya 23.14 -15] . If you have got that firm faith, then next stage is to live with, to deal with devotees. Then the faith will increase because by seeing their behavior your faith will be increased. Then bhajana kriya . Wherefrom this shenai was...?"

Jayatīrtha; Yaśodānandana,"Jaya .; Many temples also in South India, they have all the functions in the morning-waking up the Deity, bathing the Deity, dressing the Deity, they have different shenai tunes for that. Every temple.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Similarly here introduce.
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : You should play your flute. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa knows how to play the flute.,Prabhupāda, No flute.
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : He can learn to play the shenai, though.",Prabhupāda," No, shenai, yes. Very good."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There's a man here that's been here. He knows how to play shenai.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I'm bringing him to Taiwan.(?),Prabhupāda," No, it is not difficult. Anyone can learn. Yes."
Lokanātha,Lokanātha : [break] ...ing flute imitate Kṛṣṇa or what?,Prabhupāda, There is no flute. You say simply Kṛṣṇa plays flute and nobody plays?
Lokanātha; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Lokanātha : You said no playing flute.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Means in the morning.,Prabhupāda, So they are coming here?
Jayapatāka,Circumambulating the temple.,Prabhupāda, That's nice. [break]
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jayapatāka,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ...very colorful with all the devotees.; In South India, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the ācārya goes out...",Prabhupāda, So you are taking this bamboo down? This?
Jayapatāka,It's already down.,Prabhupāda," No, this down?"
Jayapatāka,"Hah, down. Cleared out.",Prabhupāda, So it is cleared. You men can live there.
Devotees in distance,Jaya !,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break]
Jayapatāka,They have big umbrella overhead.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they did it. They did it in South India when I was there."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jayapatāka,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In Nellore. That was wonderful.; We can make such arrangement?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Ācāryopāsanam. That is in the Bhagavad- gītā . Ācāryopāsanam. It is not self-aggrandizement. The ācāryopāsanā goes to Kṛṣṇa directly. Therefore it is needed. Not that it is a pompous thing. Ācāryopāsanā. Kṛṣṇa says. That is the way of knowledge. Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau [ ŚU 6.23] ."
Pañcadraviḍa,"How does that work, that if somebody has the association of a pure devotee for only a lava , one-eleventh of a second, that he attains all perfection?",Prabhupāda," If he is so sincere.... Just like dried wood immediately ignites. And if it is moist, it does not. It is the quality of the wood. One takes three hundred years; one in three minutes. That's it. [break] One is dry from the material moist of contamination, he becomes immediately ignited in spiritual..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What is that drying process?,Prabhupāda," Drying process is for many, many years one has tried to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, for many, many lives, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. 7.19 ] . When he actually becomes man of knowledge he surrenders unto God. Otherwise he is lost. His drying process may take three minute or three millions years."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : But that knowledge that Kṛṣṇa is everything comes by Kṛṣṇa's mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa's mercy is already there, but if you are not able to take it..."
Pañcadravida,Then you don't even have to hear from a self-realized soul. Simply by seeing him you can become completely purified.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Both required. The matches must be also all right, and the wood must be also. Then there is fire. If one of them is defective, then, it will not.... But when you go to the fire, you become dry. But willfully we put again water. This nonsense business makes us late. This process is already there, how to become dry. But instead of taking the process, we put water. Then how it will be ignited? The rules and regulations is the drying process. But without following the rules and regulation, if you again become a victimized by māyā , then there is water and again dry it. So this is going on, watering and drying, watering and drying. No staightforward process for drying. That will help. But difficulty is that we dry and again water."
Viṣṇujana,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, how did Choṭa Haridāsa achieve perfection by killing himself after apparently pouring water on his devotional creeper by talking to a woman?",Prabhupāda," His instance was that even an associate of Caitanya Mahāprabhu can fall down. And if one falls down, his punishment is that, suicide. There is no other punishment. He must commit suicide. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruc.... Otherwise he is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's personal servant. He cannot fall down. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed this instance that ""Even one is My personal servant, he can fall down."" And if anyone by any cause he falls down, his punishment is he must commit suicide. This is instruction."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very strict.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. ""You have fallen down? You must commit suicide. No more My association."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Is that the same as in the Bhagavad- gītā where Kṛṣṇa says, ""For one who is honored, dishonor is worse than death""?",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is another thing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally taught this. To be victimized by māyā is possi.... There is possibility.... Just like Jaya and Vijaya . They were gatekeepers in the Vaikuṇṭha . They also fell down, Hiraṇyakaśipu. So this falldown, there is possibility in any moment because we are very small. We can be captivated by māyā at any moment. Therefore we shall be very, very careful. And if you fall down, then punishment is you make suicide. That's all. Then next life we shall see."
Satsvarūpa,"But Śrīla Prabhupāda, in The Nectar of Devotion it says devotional service is so pure that there's no prāyaścitta necessary. Just again engage in your service.",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is not prāyaścitta . This is exemplary punishment. He was not liable to be punished, but they played that ""This is the.... This should be done."""
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : He did not kill himself immediately. He waited for a year.,Prabhupāda," He was waiting if Caitanya Mahāprabhu would accept him again. But when he saw that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not so lenient, he committed suicide. Vajrād api kaṭora. Harder than the thunderbolt and softer than the rose . This is the position."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But, Prabhupāda, if you were as strict as.... If you were that strict...",Prabhupāda," No, I am not Caitanya Prabhu . I am not.... Why you are comparing me? I am an ordinary man."
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : So in ISKCON, if someone falls down, it means that he should commit suicide?",Prabhupāda, No.
Gurudāsa; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"We wouldn't have much of a movement, then.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : We're too attached to our bodies anyway, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," No, no, if he falls down, that is automatically suicide. If he falls down, that means it is suicide. He got the chance. If he falls down, that is suicide."
Guru-kṛpā,Guru - kṛpā : Spiritual suicide.,Prabhupāda," Spiritual suicide. If one gets the chance of becoming eligible for going back to home, back to Godhead, and if he commits mistake and it is stopped, is it not suicide?"
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : You once gave the example, Śrīla Prabhupāda, of taking your plane off the ground and then bringing it back to land again.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guru-kṛpā,"Guru - kṛpā : You once gave the example that you take your plane to a destination, and you have to turn around and come back and start all over again, take off again.",Prabhupāda, There are so many. Dṛḍha - vrata . Bhajante mam dṛḍha - vrata . So we should be very strong-minded and continue our devotional service very strongly.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Gargamuni's doing some transaction.,Prabhupāda, Gargamuni...
Jayatīrtha,"I think he went to see about the electricity. He said that he was going to go early this morning to see about the electricity, why it is always going off.",Prabhupāda," Oh, Garga , garga means ""big jug,"" and ""money,"" full of money. Big jug full of coins. Formerly they used to..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Keep.,Prabhupāda," Not.... Cheat the government. There was no income tax, but still they used to keep in big, big jugs all gold coins and put into the..., underneath the ground. Nobody could understand where is the money. Very easy thing."
Pañcadravida,Hoarders.,Prabhupāda," And he did not disclose at the time of death; then it remained. And then, after some years, somebody digging, he got."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There's a nice example given in Nectar of Devotion about the digging for a treasure.,Prabhupāda," Hm? Yes. [break] ... shenai on the gate , that is nice. Jayapatāka?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jayapatāka,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Jayapatāka.; Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," They should play shenai on the gate , and here kīrtana will go on, not that kīrtana will be stopped to hear their dundubhi ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Shenai is not a replacement for kīrtana .,Prabhupāda, No. Shenai is meant for.... That is navadhana. That is called navadhana. [break] ...must be played. Not this dundubhi . They are playing as a dundubhi . That will not work. And along with shenai they can play.
Madhudviṣa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Getting his reeds together. ( shenai starts); Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...businessman.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. We are selling Bhāgavatam ; they are selling fish. (end)

In Vṛndāvana life we see they were not interested to know what is Brahman . They were interested how to please Kṛṣṇa , how to see Kṛṣṇa smiling. That is Vṛndāvana . Huh ? Is it not? From Vṛndāvana picture you see they are simply busy to see how Kṛṣṇa is smiling. They didn't care for studying. What they will study? They were all village girls born in the ordinary class, and they did not know. [break] That is the... Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim : [ Nārada -pañcarātra] ""If Kṛṣṇa is served, then where is the necessity of tapasya ?"" No more tapasya . Tapasya is meant for the third-grade men to come to the stage of serving Kṛṣṇa . And one who is, with heart and soul is serving Kṛṣṇa , he has finished all tapasya . Tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur ārya [SB 3.33.7 ] . They have already finished all this tapasya . Therefore they have come to this stage. Kṛta - punya - punjaḥ [ SB 10.12.11] . What is called?

Mahāprabhu , He immediately gives how to love and serve Kṛṣṇa , because this Kali - yuga , they will not be able to follow the regulative principles and become elevated. So He is therefore mahā - vadānyāya . He is giving a process-immediately, if followed, he becomes a lover of Kṛṣṇa and His service, immediately. Namo mahā - vadānyāya kṛṣṇa - prema - pradāya te [Cc.

If you look closely you will see...; The gopīs, they didn't like very much being instructed by Uddhava ?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. That was dry for them. They asked Uddhava , ""Bring Kṛṣṇa . We don't want you any more..."" [break] What is his name? That...? Tapomāyā. Tapa ... He never sees whether it is watered. He is in charge of agricultural department? Where is Jayapatāka?

Jayapatāka,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Similarly, it can be understood how he is seeing, he is managing. He does not see."
Jayapatāka,Right now we only have about four or five men here that are managing everything. He is also purchasing all the things for the festival. The GBC's have been requested to give some men...,Prabhupāda," That means he has no time. Then why he says that ""I am in charge."" He is not in charge."

Yaśodānandana,"Instead of requesting ten paisā , they may be requested to offer something to the Deity.",Prabhupāda, Why? Nothing. Let them come and see. That's all.
Yaśodānandana,[break] Our Deity is not beggar.,Prabhupāda," No. He is bestower. He gives everything. If anyone voluntary gives, that's all right. You should not ask. [break] ...instead of doing this.

Voluntarily he should give that."

He took the money, and he said, ""I am going to check to see if this is stolen."" So one week later I was worried. I called him. I said, ""What is happening?"" He said, ""That typewriter was reported one year ago stolen from the school."" But he said, ""Because I think you're a good boy, I'm not going to arrest, you because I don't think you did it. If I thought for a moment you did it, I would immediately come and take you."" So I said, ""That's all right. What about the French horn? When can I have my money back?"" He said, ""You just forget about this. You leave it to me.""",Prabhupāda," To keep you honest. (laughter) To keep you honest, you just don't hope your money."

There was ten millions dollars worth of drugs confiscated from a boat, and they put it in the police lockup, and then it was gone.",Prabhupāda," In Navadvīpa ... You have heard the name of Vamsidāsa Bābājī. So sometimes, when his things were stolen, the disciples will cry that ""It is stolen."" So he said, ""Why you are bothering? One thief gives; another thief takes. That's all. Who gave the money, he is also thief, and who has taken away, he is also thief. So why you are bothering?"" One thief gives; another thief takes."

Satsvarūpa; Devotee (1),""" Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , the Indian classic par excellence on bhakti - yoga , attributed to Vyāsa , is one of the most important and influential religio-philosophical works within the Vedic tradition. Thanks to the devoted and scholarly endeavors of Śrī A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the entire work of twelve cantos will be available in a superb English edition for the benefit of the English-reading peoples. In his impeccable style the author presents each verse in original Sanskrit, followed by roman transliteration, English equivalents, translation, and elaborate commentary. The lucid and cogent exegesis brings into relief the theory and practice of Bhāgavata philosophy in relation to contemporary man and his problems of life. I have read the first volume containing First Canto, Part One, Chapter 1-7, with pleasure and profit. A brief account of the life of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu included in this volume illustrates the central theme of the entire text, the loving service of God. A glossary and index to Sanskrit verses and a general index have been added for the convenience of scholars. This monumental work is immensely valuable alike to historians of religion, linguistic scholars, cultural anthropologists, pious devotees, as well as to the general reader interested in spiritual matters.

Satsvarūpa; Devotees; Devotee (1),"""It is axiomatic that no book can be expected entirely to satisfy all its potential readers. Here is one, Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , however, which can be said to come remarkably close to that ideal. Clearly this book is intended mainly for those who are interested in, or may become so, transcendental science and, more specifically, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For them it could hardly be bettered, since the elaborate purports attached to each text explain elegantly and lucidly and in every possible detail the underlying meaning of the Sanskrit verses and their relevance to this increasingly popular philosophical outlook. The work is at the same time no less impressive to one who is a layman in the context of transcendental science. A student of Sanskrit or a general linguist with only a smattering of the language would gain much from going through this book and others in the set. That this is so is the result of the way the texts are presented. Each text in Devanāgarī is followed by an exact roman transliteration. This in turn followed by an English transliteration of each separate work. After this comes a translation in flowing English. The result is that with only a modest amount of effort one can succeed in reading and understanding the Sanskrit verses, and the experience is very rewarding. At the end of the book is appended a goodly amount of further helpful material. There is a glossary of important Sanskrit terms, a Sanskrit pronunciation guide, an index of Sanskrit verses in the whole of the First Canto of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , and a general index to the First Canto.

Unfortunately, many unscrupulous persons come from India, exhibit their imperfect and ordinary knowledge of yoga , cheat the people with their wares consisting of mantras, and present themselves as incarnations of God. So many of these cheaters have come, convincing their foolish followers to accept them as God, that those who are actually well versed and learned in Indian culture have become very concerned and troubled.
