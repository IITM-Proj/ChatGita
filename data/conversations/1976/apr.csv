PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Vṛndāvana morning walk, Vṛndāvana , April 2, 1976. Śrīla Prabhupāda is walking in the Vṛndāvana Municipal Park this morning. He drove here by car in his Mercedes. Now he's taking walk here.",Prabhupāda, Car?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes, car is locked, and the driver of the other car is watching it.",Prabhupāda," [break] ...small park, they cannot maintain it."
Tripurāri,"...reading in Caitanya - caritāmṛta , the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā temple. And towards the end, one Bengali Vaiṣṇava brāhmaṇa washed the feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu , and He became a little angry, outwardly angry, and unhappy within. And in one purport you mention that the spiritual master should not be offered obeisances or have his feet washed before the Deity. But the impression of most of the devotees has been that in the presence of the spiritual master one can stop worshiping the Deity and offer obeisances to the spiritual master. So I was wondering which is correct.",Prabhupāda, (chuckles) Dilemma.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : I mean, it's obvious if it was detrimental to our devotional service, then Prabhupāda would correct it.",Prabhupāda," They cannot also keep clean even Central Park. Then what to speak of Vṛndāvana ? Things are becoming very, very..."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Here in Vṛndāvana the people also pay taxes?,Prabhupāda," Yes, without tax.... [break]"
Tripurāri,"...in the day sometimes, and now they are giving prasādam to the devotees free, without charge. [break] ...stay?",Prabhupāda, They stay at the Rādhā - Dāmodara temple. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Tripurāri,Those are the originals?,Prabhupāda, (aside:) Jaya . Jaya .
Ādi-keśava,"Ādi- keśava : [break] ...the devotees are asking one question. They're wanting to know how it was that even though there is so much distance between, let's say, Govardhana and Rādhā - kuṇḍa and Vṛndāvana , Nanda - grāma , Varṣāṇā, how it was that still Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā could go and meet, and the cowherd boys could go and meet at these various places. They could go such great distances.",Prabhupāda," That is distance for you, not for them. Just like a small ant. It goes from here to here. It is a great, three hundred miles, but for you, one step. Why do you study Kṛṣṇa like you? Why do you think that Kṛṣṇa was like you? Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. 9.11 ] . Kṛṣṇa can do anything, so His associates."
Pañca-draviḍa; Tripurāri; Pañca-draviḍa,"Pañca - draviḍa : In the Upadeśāmṛta, in the translation you refer to this, the līlā - aṣṭa ...; Aṣṭakāla- līlā .; Pañca - draviḍa : Aṣṭakāla- līlā . What is that exactly? Eightfold līlā or some...?",Prabhupāda," Eightfold, but..., eight grahas."
Gurudāsa,Śrīla Prabhupāda? So the timings are.... At new Govinda temple the...,Prabhupāda, New Govinda temple?
Gurudāsa,"New Govinda and old Govinda , both. Starting at 7:30 is the dhūpa - ārati , and then, nine o'clock, is another ārati , then the rāja - bhoga ārati is at 11:30. Gopīnātha's temple is staggered, a little after 7:30, and the Rādhā - ramaṇa temple is 8:30. So they stagger like that. So the next ārati will be 7:30.",Prabhupāda," But in the morning, before..."
Gurudāsa,Five o'clock. They start at five. The maṅgala -āratis start at five. (end),Prabhupāda, All of them are South African?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No, actually, he's from South Africa and he's from South Africa. These two devotees are going down for the first time, and Jagat - guru was preaching there once before.",Prabhupāda, So they will get visa ?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They don't require visa except for Jagat - guru . He's British, he's Canadian. He's South African boy. He's South African.",Prabhupāda," Oh, they don't require visa ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Only Jagat - guru dāsa , American.",Prabhupāda, Oh. So he'll get visa ?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda," So all five, you are going?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Now, we have studied this South Africa. They like our movement. They are purchasing books. That is very good sign. Is it not? They are purchasing? Who are purchasing books? Educated circle?"
Devotee (1),Colleges.,Prabhupāda," College. That is.... College, universities, that is educated.... So I was surprised when, after my meeting, they purchased books, because these South African white men, they do not like very much Indians. Is it not?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : It's a fact.,Prabhupāda," But still, they like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is very good sign."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Even the Indians are attracted to our Indian culture.,Prabhupāda, They lost their culture.
Jagat-guru,"Jagat - guru : Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking that this is 1976, and in July there is Ratha - yātrā . So by next year, '77, we hope to be able to have Ratha - yātrā in Durban. There may be a quarter of a million, half a million Indian people. One cart and three deities on one cart.",Prabhupāda, And whether government will allow?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Jagat-guru,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : I think so. They already have permission.; Jagat - guru : They can give permission, will do probably. And also we want to establish also, apart from the temple, one bus program which will reach all the towns and villages there in South Africa.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Jagat-guru,"Jagat - guru : And also we will go to Rhodesia and probably Malawi and maybe Mozambique, which are countries in our area. And also I spoke to the boys from Mauritius, and...",Prabhupāda," Mauritius, we have got now devotee."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, You have kept his address?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Two devotees.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : One is that gentleman, Mr. Narayan. He's an engineer with the city electrical department, and the other is a full-time devotee. I have his address, Mr. Narayan's address.",Prabhupāda, So they are still here?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Jagat-guru,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : He's anxious to go back. He's going to London until August; then he's going back to Mauritius with his family.; Jagat - guru : We will invite him to come to our Durban festival. And also I've suggested that they also arrange something big, festival, because there are 600,000 Indians there, and that some of our men can go to the island and give them association.",Prabhupāda, So they'll give visa ? Me?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : For you? Oh, yes. I think we have to make a chest x-ray again and take several shots for you, (laughter) no problem.",Prabhupāda, So when you are going back? Tomorrow?
Jagat-guru,Jagat - guru : Yes.,Prabhupāda, When? Early in the morning?
Devotee,Yes. We're making the arrangement tomorrow to go. We're getting tickets and some books. Then Jagat - guru will follow a few days later.,Prabhupāda," Make vigorous propaganda all over the world. From South Africa, Australia, there is direct service."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Direct service.,Prabhupāda, Perth.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Perth.,Prabhupāda, From Perth to...
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Sydney.,Prabhupāda," No, South Africa...?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : How many hours? It's about nine hours.,Prabhupāda, Not much. Nearer than India. From India to Australia takes so many hours.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Five hours it was, from Bombay to Mauritius.",Prabhupāda," Five hours, again nine hours."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : And then it was about three hours to South Africa from Mauritius.,Prabhupāda," No, from Mauritius they can go directly to Australia. No?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Direct to?,Prabhupāda, Australia.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Hari-śauri; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes. If the flight is broken up like that, it's a little easier, from South Africa to Mauritius to Perth, or even to Bombay. It's about the same distance from Bombay to Mauritius as to Australia from Mauritius.; Hari - śauri : Prabhupāda is thinking about going from India to South Africa to Australia to make the flight easier.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : I don't think it makes the flight easier, because you're going like a triangle, this way and then this way. Let us arrange some nice program first, so that when you come again we'll have something nice to offer you.",Prabhupāda, I think in Mauritius there is good field. They adopted culture.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : The problem in Mauritius has been that either they don't know how to collect, or they say it's a very poor country and they're not able to get funds to start any kind of a dynamic program.",Prabhupāda, They cannot chant even?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Chanting they do.,Prabhupāda, That is wanted. We don't want money. So give them directly.
Jagat-guru,"Jagat - guru : Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.... (too faint)",Prabhupāda," South African mission, very good."
Devotee,"At this present moment, Prabhupāda, we have a really unique situation, the best of all.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"A unique situation in South Africa, because there are many Europeans that are being drafted into the Army, but they will not allow the Indians to be drafted. They don't want them to go into the military forces because they're afraid they're too intelligent.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Some of our brahmacārīs, they've been drafted into the army. We've lost several devotees like that, because it's very hard for them to maintain their Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the army.",Prabhupāda, Conscription.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes, conscription. But the Indians are not drafted. There's no army for them. So we're hoping that in Durban, where you first preached at the City Hall, the young people there, if we can get them sufficiently enthused, that they'll also join, and then we'll be able to have a very big movement amongst Indian community as well. We won't lose any devotees like that from the draft.",Prabhupāda," I think our students who are going to be ministers, they are excused from draft."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Devotee; Jagat-guru,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : No, even in South Africa the ministers.... No excuse. It's a very strict situation. If you don't go into the army, you go to jail. Even if you're a minister, they don't care. There is no religious grounds for objecting. But only the Europeans are in the army, no one else. They're afraid that if the Indians had guns, they might use them against the Europeans.; So we're going to try and make more devotees this year, more Indian devotees especially. We've never really tried before.; Jagat - guru : Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you have seen on our altar, Gaura - Nitāi ? We have large Gaura - Nitāi and two small, three actually, three small sets of Gaura - Nitāi Deities. The ones on the far left, just under Lord Nityānanda's feet, They are going also to South Africa. They came originally from East Africa. I mentioned it when I first came to Māyāpura(?). So we will be taking them. We have a very nice siṁhāsana built for Them, finished tomorrow, and we'll be displaying Them at all our programs, preaching programs.",Prabhupāda, Do the needful. That's all.
Devotees,(offer obeisances) Jaya .,Prabhupāda, Jaya . Hare Kṛṣṇa .
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : They're very enthusiastic to preach.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is life. One who is enthusiastic to preach, he is living. Others are dead. Just see how beautiful. Who is the rascal scientist can manufacture that by combination of chemicals?"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : They can imitate the fragrance. (laughs) They can imitate like monkeys.,Prabhupāda," If you see only to the flowers, you become invigorated."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : If you see only?,Prabhupāda," Invigorated, get a refreshment."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : If you just see a flower. Yes, just to walk through a nice garden, it's very pacifying.",Prabhupāda," How many different colors and set up, craftsmanship. There is no brain behind."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Chance.,Prabhupāda," It is not chance. In this particular tree, this flower will grow. Color will not change. (pause) So somebody is preparing?"
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Who? (end)
Indian,"[break] ...nobody. Only (indistinct) would come here, they would stay here for a few hours and then go back.",Prabhupāda, The tank is not with water.
Indian,"Yes, they used to have water at both sides of the inside. Now, probably, they are short of water or they have switched on to agriculture. So many they used to have flowers and tulasī and all that. Now they have come to agriculture-wheat, barley.",Prabhupāda, Money. Such a nice tank is vacant.
Indian,"I remember my young days. People, young boys, they used to come swim here.",Prabhupāda," Oh. Just see. So you may pay them, say, 150, 200 rupees each. Then it will be all maintained, and that much money you can spend."
Indian,"And if it's nicely maintained, possibility you can get some return out of it.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That way we shall get fruits and flowers.
Jayādvaita,I was seeing yesterday in Rādhā - Dāmodara Mandira that nothing is nicely maintained except for your rooms.,Prabhupāda, (Hindi) Rādhā - Dāmodara temple (Hindi).
Indian,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, Oh. (Hindi)
Indian,"Oldest place in Vṛndāvana . I am not even aspirant of religion or psychology, but people are very much interested in Hinduism there.",Prabhupāda, (Hindi)
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : [break] ...should have a nice path all the way around.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (Hindi)
Lokanātha,"Lokanātha : We should buy some for you, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," No, we can buy the whole thing. (Hindi) I'll talk with him. (Hindi—Prabhupāda bargaining with chili seller in long exchange) You have got money?"
Jayatīrtha(?),Yes.,Prabhupāda," (Hindi) So give him two rupees, eight annas. (Hindi)"
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Bargain.,Prabhupāda," My father used to do that. He'd go to a vegetable vendor. He has got a big basket, and he'll say, ""What do you want for all, the whole basket."" So he is ready because he'll sit down so long, so at very cheap rate he'll give it. And it was not required in the family so much. My mother became very angry, that ""You are bringing so many, so much vegetable, it is being spoiled."" But he would purchase like that. If you give him in those days fifty rupees to go to the market, he will spend all the money and bring at home. Hare Kṛṣṇa . (Hindi) We are prepared to spend. [break] ...from saintly person."
Vrajavāsī,Vrajavāsī : Haribol!,Prabhupāda, Haribol. Jaya ! Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Vrajavāsī,Vrajavāsī : Jaya Rādhārāṇī ki !,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . (Hindi)
Vrajavāsī,Vrajavāsī : Haribol!,Prabhupāda, Haribol. Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Vrajavāsī,Vrajavāsī : Haribol. Haribol. Haribol.,Prabhupāda," (Hindi) Oh, when our festival?"
Gurudāsa; Pañca-draviḍa,"Guru dāsa : Sixth, seventh, and eighth. Tomorrow, next day, and the Rāma - navamī . (Hindi—break); Pañca - draviḍa : In the Bhāgavatam it says that if a person cannot offer a straw mat like that to a saintly person when he visits, he doesn't live in a house...",Prabhupāda," But if he hasn't got extra straw, how can he do?"
Pañca-draviḍa,"Pañca - draviḍa : He may offer obeisances. If he can't do that, simply cry.",Prabhupāda," Straw? Straw is offered. Oh, not taken care of."
Pañca-draviḍa,"Pañca - draviḍa : You said if he couldn't, if he cannot do that, he does not live in a house, but he lives in a tree full of snakes.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So he has offered seat.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda? In the Bhāgavatam it says that although Lord Viṣṇu is the controller of everything, He is particularly in charge with the mode of goodness, and He is associated with maintenance. So is it that in order to maintain something in this material world also, there has to be the touch of the mode of goodness?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Evaṁ prasanna -manaso?,Prabhupāda," Evaṁ prasanna -manaso bhagavad- bhakti - yogataḥ [SB 1.2.20 ] . Then he becomes prasanna - manasaḥ , happy mood. Then he can cultivate devotional service. Otherwise not possible. Ceta etair anāviddhaṁ sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati . Unless one is situated in sattva - guṇa , there is no possibility of peacefulness. (Hindi) (end)"
Indian,Return with interest.,Prabhupāda," Anyway, so he was the father of the Yakṣas, this Kuvera . So Dhruva Mahārāja was a great devotee. You have heard the name of Dhruva Mahārāja . He was insulted by his stepmother. When he was young, very young child, so his father had two wives. So the junior wife was very pet to the husband, and the senior wife was not so much pet. But both of them had two sons. So the junior wife's son was sitting on the lap, a small child. So Dhruva Mahārāja was the son of the senior wife. As a child, he was also trying to sit down on the lap of the father. The other brother, he does not know stepbrother is brother. But the junior wife, she said, ""My dear son, you cannot sit down on the lap of your father because you are not born in my womb. And that boy, the other boy, he is sitting on the lap of your father because he is born in my womb."" So it was sarcastic remark, but Dhruva Mahārāja , although he was a child, four or five years old, he took it very seriously. A kṣatri..., kṣatriya ... (Hindi) He became very angry. So he immediately left the place and went to his own mother, that ""Stepmother has insulted me like this."" He began to cry, and the mother said, ""My dear son, what can I do? Your father does not treat me even as a maidservant, so I cannot take any step."" ""So how I can take revenge on it?"" She said, ""If Kṛṣṇa likes, then you can take revenge. Otherwise there is no possibility."" ""Where is Kṛṣṇa ? I want to see Him."" Child.... (Hindi) She said, ""I have heard that Kṛṣṇa is in the forest. Big, big saintly persons go there and meet Him, so far I know, my dear son."" ""So I'll go there."" So this four-year, five-years-old boy went to the forest, and he saw Kṛṣṇa within, Viṣṇu , within six months by his austerity, by meditating and observing austerity, living on water, on folio (foliage?), air, in this way, six months, he got the opportunity of seeing Viṣṇu directly. And there is a big story. Later on he was enthroned on the father's seat. He became very big king. But his younger brother, the same brother, was killed by the Yakṣas in the fight. So he wanted to take revenge on the Yakṣas, and he was killing the Yakṣas like anything. Then the Yakṣas' father, Kuvera , he came to him with other, recommendation of other demigods, that ""You are a Vaiṣṇava . It is not good for you that you are killing so many Yakṣas indiscriminately. Now, whatever is done, you stop it."" Then this Kuvera was very much pleased because his descendants were being killed and the fight is stopped, so he was very pleased. This is our point to understand. The Kuvera was very pleased, and he offered Dhruva Mahārāja that ""You have become so kind. You could kill all my descendants, but you have stopped, so I am very much pleased upon you that you saved my family. So I want to give you some benediction. Whatever benediction you want, you can take from me."" Now this benediction.... He is Kuvera . He is the treasurer of the demigods, unlimited wealth. And he offered him that ""Whatever you like, you can take."" But what Dhruva Mahārāja did? Dhruva Mahārāja said that ""Kuverajī, I am very much obliged to you that you are offering me benediction and you are the treasurer of the demigods. I can take money from you as much as I like. But my prayer to you—that I don't require any money. Kindly give me your blessings that I'll remain a devotee of Kṛṣṇa ."""
Devotees,Jaya . Haribol.,Prabhupāda," So I have got now the Punjab National Bank, so you are ready to give me money, but I request you that you bless me that I may remain a servant of Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotees; Indian,Jaya !; Should I represent Kuvera ?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian (1),"Now Mahārājajī has told you the story about the Kuvera of the old days. I will tell you the story of the Kuveras of the today. That is us. In fact, it was in a paper. There was a cartoon. A bank manager, means today's Kuvera , was sitting in an office, and he received a call, such and such big Dalmiya or Birla, ""We want two lakhs of rupees just now."" He said, ""Yes, come along. Here is our Swamiji. He'll pay you two lakhs. "" Then there was another call. There was some industrialist or a small-scale industrialist man. He said, ""I want to start an industry. Could I get a lakh of rupees as a loan from you?"" He said, ""Yes, yes. Please do come along and we'll make some arrangements."" Then he also. And ultimately the third picture in the cartoon, that the manager—that is today's Kuvera —he goes out of the bank. He is standing on the gate , and he says to that caukidāra, (Hindi punchline-laughter). It is today's Kuvera is not in any position to give anything. He also wants your blessings, you see, in fact.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Indian (1),"So if about the bankers, if you permit me, I'll give you another interesting story. There was a man who was very ill in America and he had a heart trouble. In fact he had no heart, I would say. So, you know, they can replace the hearts nowadays. He went to a hospital, and the doctor offered him two or three hearts, ""Which one would you like? One is of the general, the other is of a big businessman, and the third is of a banker. What would you like?"" So he thought, ""Let me have the heart of a...""",Prabhupāda, Banker.
Indian (1),"""...banker."" (laughter) So the doctor said, ""Why do you want to have the heart of a banker?"" He thought, ""Because I'm sure it has never been used."" (laughter)",Prabhupāda, I'll recite another very nice story...[break]
Indian (2); Indian (3); Indian (1); Gurudāsa; Indian (1),"(Hindi—about opening a branch of the bank); (Hindi); There seem to be little misunderstanding, not that we are short of any space or any accommodation or anything for which we can't open, but there's a little technical thing that bank license does not permit, and we are immediately taking or mending the license, and as soon as it is, we'll start. We have no problem of this.; Guru dāsa : Prabhupāda, did you want to tell another story?; But I had only two. I won't be able to...",Prabhupāda," (laughter) The story is that one poor man was informed by his friend that ""Money draws money."" That's a fact. If you have got money, you can draw money. So he went to the bank, and the cashier was counting huge amount of money, and he threw his coin on the cash..., (laughs) and he was waiting: ""When the whole money will come to me?"" Then the cashier saw this man is standing: ""What is the...? Why you are standing?"" ""Sir, I heard that money draws money, so I had one coin. I have dropped with your money. I am waiting when it will come to me."" So he said, ""No, no. The fact is that, money draws.... Now my money has drawn your money."" (laughter) So.... (Hindi)"
Indian (1),"Perhaps it is in the Bible that ""Those who have shall be given more. Those who have not shall be taken of what they have already."" I don't whether it's right or not, but more money draws the lesser money.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (Hindi)
Indian (1); Devotee,"The new license will be.... (Hindi to end; Morning walk, April 7, 1976, Vṛndāvana , Raṅga Gardens. (Hindi) [break]",Prabhupāda, ...dozen carts.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : It looks like it came from...,Prabhupāda," [break] ...cannot say, Hare Kṛṣṇa . There is such competition. (Hindi with others) I like this garden very nice. (Hindi) It is maintained very nicely. We can get flowers. (Hindi) Water is supply there? (Hindi)"
Indian man,"There are two wells. (Hindi) The river is very near. Just after that garden, Yamunā . (Hindi)",Prabhupāda," These people, they like Vṛndāvana . (Hindi) What is our telephone number?"
Akṣayānanda; Devotees; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Indian man,179.; 8.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Vṛndāvana 178.; 178. (Hindi),Prabhupāda," So they are not tres.... (Hindi) Whatever you think, as you like, we can ex.... [break] (Hindi) [break]"
Tripurāri,"I can remember from Caitanya - caritāmṛta , one devotee of Lord Rāmacandra was always chanting the name of Rāma , but Lord Caitanya convinced him to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," (laughs) There is competition like that. One will say ""Hare Rāma ."" Another will say ""No, Hare Kṛṣṇa ."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Hari-śauri,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : He was very obstinate.; Hari - śauri : Or that man in Delhi.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : That man in Delhi thought we had something against Lord Rāmacandra .,Prabhupāda," There are many versions like that. Somebody will say, ""Your Rāmacandra may be very important person, but when Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa , Lord Rāmacandra becomes His (Her) guard with arrows..."" (laughter) When Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa , and Rāmacandra has to serve Rādhārāṇī with arrows and bows. (pause) This is gorur.(?)"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Hm.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : What is that six-pointed star significance?,Prabhupāda, Cakra .
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Hari-śauri,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Oh.; Hari - śauri : What is the symbol on the right-hand side, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, I think śaṅkha . That is the conchshell.
Akṣayānanda,"[break] ...thread from the Deity, the old sacred thread, and they tie it on their wrist. They tie it here.",Prabhupāda, Who?
Akṣayānanda,Some of the devotees have started to do that now.,Prabhupāda, Why?
Akṣayānanda,"I don't know. It's just like wearing beads. The sacred thread from the Deity, after replacing, they take the old one and they wear it here.",Prabhupāda, Who has told them?
Akṣayānanda,I don't know.,Prabhupāda, Then why...
Akṣayānanda,"Well, I told one boy to stop it, and because I couldn't quote any authority, he keeps wearing...",Prabhupāda," No, no, there is no author.... Where is his authority?"
Akṣayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, This nonsense should be stopped.
Akṣayānanda,"Yes, I thought it was wrong. That's why I mentioned it. I wanted to make sure.",Prabhupāda, Stop this.
Akṣayānanda; Hari-śauri,"Okay. Sure.; Hari - śauri : I think their idea is that because it's prasādam , it's from the Deity, that they're able to wear it.",Prabhupāda," That is another concoction. The sacred thread is not used like that, in the hand."
Akṣayānanda; Hari-śauri,"I thought it was wrong. It seems like some kind of fashion or something, concocted fashion.; Hari - śauri : [break] ...small black beads that the devotees are wearing from Rādhā - kuṇḍa . They have a string of beads made of clay from Rādhā - kuṇḍa . Are they...?",Prabhupāda, Rādhā - kuṇḍa clay is not bad.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : So it's all right to wear them?,Prabhupāda, Not very constantly.

The persons from the ecclesiastical order, they are also so polluted, they are sanctioning homosex, abortion. What can be done for the common man?"

The difficulty is they have no education about human civilization. Bahir - artha - māninā . They are simply captivated by the external energy, bodily conception of life. They do not know what is the aim of life. This is Western civilization. Na te viduḥ svārtha- gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB 7.5.31 ] . This is not Western, this is the demonic civilization.

Madhudviṣa; Lokanātha,"Housewives think like that already. They take some pills, and they become very slim and they don't have to eat so much. They just smoke cigarettes and drink coffee and take pills. And they're saving money, they think. They don't have to buy so much food, and they're able to remain slim and trim.

(laughter) That was my program. And I was going to say that ""Don't eat meat. No illicit sex,"" and immediately they will kick me out. ""All right."" I never thought that you would accept it. That is the idea of my poetry. That is sung, no? You have got that?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," And I was asking Kṛṣṇa , ""I do not know why You have brought me here. As soon as I will say these things, they will kick me out. What is Your program, I do not know."" (chuckles)"

They are trying to sell the grains and get more money, and purchase wine and enjoy. And when the animal will be unable to work, sell him to the slaughterhouse and get money. And for these sinful activities, they are suffering."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Their idea is just to exploit.,Prabhupāda," Hah, yes. Everyone is trying to get more, and nature's order is that you take only to maintain your body and soul together. That's all. If you take more, then you are thief, you'll be punished by the laws of nature. This is going on. Laws of nature are so fine that by material activities you'll never be satisfied, and at the time of death, he'll lament that ""I could not satisfy my desires. Let me take..."" ""All right, take another body. Satisfy."" This is nature's punishment. Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB 3.31.1 ] . Simple things. We desire, and nature will give you another body. māyā -yantrārūḍhāni. He'll give you, ""Ride on this car, you wanted, on this body."" And this... This is creation of māyā . Īśvaraḥ sarva - bhūtānāṁ hṛd - deśe ... [Bg. 18.61 ]. Kṛṣṇa is there, orders māyā , ""He wants to enjoy life. Give him this body."" ""Come on, here is a hog's body, eat nicely, stool. Come on."" He did not like to eat prasādam . He wanted something rubbish. ""All right, come here. Take this stool."" These things are going automatically. The same way, as you infect some disease, immediately the disease is there. You haven't got to manufacture diseases. Because you have infected yourself with the disease germ, ""Take this disease."" Therefore it is warned, anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [ Brs. 1.1.11] , ""Don't desire anything except Kṛṣṇa's service."" Then you are immune. Otherwise you have to take birth. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they take the Absolute Truth void, so they have no good desires, again they come to material desires."
Lokanātha,Lokanātha : They want to be desireless.,Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
Madhudviṣa,"If the Māyāvādīs don't believe in the difference between the soul and the Supersoul, then how can they... What is their explanation of reincarnation?",Prabhupāda," They say that this is not incarnation, it is māyā . Just like the sky is covered in a pot, and as soon as the pot breaks, the sky mixes with the big sky. That's all. That is their theory."
Madhudviṣa,So therefore they say God is covered.,Prabhupāda, Not God. You are covered.
Pañcadraviḍa,"But you are God, they say.",Prabhupāda," So you are God, but you are covered by this body. So as soon as the body is finished, you mix with. Just like you take one pot and you take water. The water is there, but if you break this pot, the water comes and mixes with."
Pañcadraviḍa; Madhudviṣa,"Then what is their reason for not becoming the biggest rascal? Why not become the biggest rascal? The pot's going to break anyway. What difference does it make? Why not become a big rascal and enjoy?; Because the Māyāvādīs, they also perform some austerity and tapasya .",Prabhupāda, Just to break the pot. That is their (indistinct)
Madhudviṣa; Lokanātha,But what is the breaking of the pot?; Lokanātha : The pot doesn't refer to the body but the illusion. They want to get rid of not the body but the illusion.,Prabhupāda," No, illusion in this sense, that I am covered by the pot, it will break or I shall break, and when it is broken then there is no more pot. I become one with the sky."
Madhudviṣa,So why should you endeavor for it? It's going to happen anyway.,Prabhupāda, To break it as soon as possible. (laughter)
Pañcadraviḍa; Madhudviṣa,"That doesn't make any sense. ""Crackpot philosophy.""; If there's no individuality, I can't understand how can there be any desire for...",Prabhupāda," No, there is individuality, but these people do not understand it, because... In the Bhagavad- gītā , acchedyam. It is not that part is taken. The accedya. Because spirit cannot be cut into pieces, and while it is in piece, either you take it in part or something else, that is eternal. It is not that by the māyā we have become piece. Yes. That is not māyā . It is piece. All right, sanātana , mamaivāṁśo jīva - bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ [Bg. 15.7 ] , eternally that piece."
Lokanātha,Lokanātha : They did not take that to mean the constitutional position of the living entity.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they do not know. Therefore they are less intelligent. They are individual, but artificially they are thinking, ""I shall become one."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda, the karmīs may argue that to become desireless is against the natural order. Because we see that right from the beginning of our life we're desiring so many things.",Prabhupāda," Desireless. When he will desire less, you convince. They're always desiring."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda, Then where is desireless?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : But we're saying anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyaṁ jñāna -karmādy anāvṛtam [ Brs. 1.1.11] .,Prabhupāda," Anya , anya means anyathā . You are servant, you should always desire how to serve Kṛṣṇa . That is your natural. And if you don't want to serve, that is anyathā . Anyābhilāṣa. That is anyābhilāṣa. Anya means other, abhilāṣa means desire. So everyone has got desire, but that desire should be natural, according to position. But if you desire something else, nonsense, then you suffer. That... Caitanya Mahāprabhu said jīvera svarūpa haya nitya - kṛṣṇa - dāsa [Cc. Madhya 20.108 -109] . You are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa , so you desire only how to serve Him. Why you are desiring otherwise? They will suffer. We are desiring, ""I shall become God,"" ""I shall become one with God,"" ""I shall become this, I shall become..."" So many hundreds and thousands. So that you have to stop. Because you are servant, you should desire how to serve Kṛṣṇa . That is your natural... Eh? Just like in your country the women, they are thinking of equal rights. Eh? And how you can equal rights? You have to become pregnant. So you become pregnant and take care of the child; that is your duty. In India still, you'll find they are happy. And now they are, ""No, we shall be equal with the men."" And how you'll stop your pregnancy? And that they do not think. So they're thinking that ""We shall not be pregnant, and if we become pregnant we shall kill, and we shall have equal rights with the men."" This is going on."
Madhudviṣa,"They say they may become pregnant and have children, but the men should take care of the children, equally.",Prabhupāda," Why? Why you should take? You are meant for taking... The child does not go to the father for being taken care. It goes to the mother. Even animals. There are so many chicken, hens, they go after the mother."
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : They get milk from the mother, not from the father.",Prabhupāda, Yes. How to stop it?
Lokanātha,Lokanātha : How could father feed even the child?,Prabhupāda," Just see, in all there are so many husbandless girls, and the children have not gone with the husbands, to the man. They are after the mother. How you'll have equal rights? They cannot. At this your heart will cry, ""Oh, I have left my children, I am unhappy."" That is... Just like our Hari -śauri's grandmother's advice to his mother to kill him. He said. And she refused. This is natural inclination. How... Artificially they are thinking like that, violating nature's law. Therefore they must suffer. As soon as you break ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. 3.27 ] . These rascals, on account of being misled by misconception of life, ahaṅkāra , false ahaṅkāra , kartāham, I can do everything. Any little pinch of nature's law, if you break, you'll suffer. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] . You cannot escape. But still they're thinking, ""We're independent."" That is ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā, by false prestige, by false identification. He is (indistinct) and he's thinking so many nonsense. Ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā. Everything will be explained in Bhagavad- gītā . So try to explain. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order, yāre dekha , tāre kaha , 'kṛṣṇa- upadeśa [ Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] .' Bas, finished, ""You become a guru ."" The trouble(?) is there. You haven't got to manufacture your ideas. Just like I'm quoting from Kṛṣṇa's preaching."
Lokanātha,"Lokanātha : They take objection when we preach. They say, ""Have you seen God or Kṛṣṇa ?"" We haven't seen God, how could we speak about God? Sometimes they take objection.",Prabhupāda," Very good. You have not seen your grandfather, why do you take his will? To inherit the money. You have not seen your grandfather. You rascal, you are very much anxious to take his money, according to his will. What is the answer? You have not seen your grandfather, so why you take his will? Eh? What is his answer? Rascal while taking money: ""I will take my grandfather's will."" Just see. You have to learn how to capture the rascals. [break]"

But then again we see that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu listened, you know, attentively for so many hours to Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and also Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī . How is it can we understand...?",Prabhupāda," Just to see how the animal is jumping. (to passers-by:) Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya , jaya .

Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : He just waited till he dried up.,Prabhupāda," Jaya . He's foolish. He knows that he has got some limited stock; it will be finished very soon, so ""Let him finish, then I shall capture."" That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's policy."
Madhudviṣa,But should we take that example or...?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not?

Akṣayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Akṣayānanda,You must have known that before you went to the West.,Prabhupāda," No, it was Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. Kṛṣṇa wanted to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries, so He gave me the chance to take the credit, that's all. It is Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. But He liked that one of His devotee may take the credit. That's all. Nimitta - mātraṁ bhava savyasācin . Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna that ""I have already killed them. They are not returning, either you fight or not fight, but you can take the credit."" So it was arrangement of Kṛṣṇa that Western countries should now have this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And He wanted to give the credit to His poor servant. That's all. Kṛṣṇa likes that. He does everything, but He gives credit to His (chuckling) poor servant. That is my..., vairāgya .

With great vow and endeavor, kīrtana should go on. Then it is perfect. There is no difficulty. Teṣāṁ satata - yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti - pūrvakam [Bg. 10.10 ] . The kīrtana is bhajana . So if you are engaged, satatam , in kīrtana , then you are safe. Māyā's father will not be able to touch. In India as soon as you say, ""You give up your family life,"" immediately he becomes morose.

Hari-śauri; Akṣayānanda,Hari - śauri : There's some village on the other side?; I don't know.,Prabhupāda," No, for village the government is not going to keep such nice road. This government department, forest department.... The government policy is to develop these places for industry in future. This industry is the cause of falldown of the human society—industry. So the reaction is.... The industry, two things required—four things required: land, labor, capital, and organization. So now the industry is going on, and the capitalists and labor, there is fight. The laborers, they are finding out that ""We are working. Why the capitalists will take the profit?"" This is communism. Is it not?"
Akṣayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So the Communists, they are thinking, ""By changing the hand, things will improve."" But they do not know that very industry is the cause of falldown. They're simply trying to change the hand. The principle should go on, industry, only the proposal is that the capitalists should give up and the workers should take it."
Devotee (2),Which way is India headed towards? The capitalists or the Communists?,Prabhupāda," India has no, had no such ideas. They are borrowing ideas. India's idea is self-realization. Live very simple life— brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , vaiśya , śūdra . The brāhmaṇas, they are living simple life, becoming very learned scholar, pure character, advanced in spiritual life—one class, ideal. And kṣatriyas, they are supposed to be the king. They distribute the land on nominal taxation, and the vaiśyas utilize the land for cultivation and cow-keeping, and the śūdras, they are engaged as weaver, blacksmith, goldsmith, mean other necessities of life. In this way the whole society is simplified, and the central point is how to become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by cooperation. This is India's civilization. There is no question of industry. Ugra - karma . It has been condemned in the Bhagavad- gītā as ugra - karma , laboring very hard for livelihood. This industry means engage the poor worker class to work very hard, and there is huge profit, and some directors of the capitalists, they take it. And they have one dozen motorcars, palatial building, no work, simply wine and woman, that's all. This is going on. And the others, they are seeing: ""There is no classification, neither real brāhmaṇa nor kṣatriya nor vaiśya . So he is enjoying like that. He has got so many cars. He has got such a nice apartment. Why not me?"" There is struggle. This is actual picture. Our Vedic advice is that make life very simple. You must have some means of livelihood. Keep your body and soul together. So according to quality, guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] , there must be division and then simple life. The real aim is tam abhyarcya , how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Everyone is.... Brāhmaṇa is guiding, kṣatriya is ruling, and vaiśya is producing food, and śūdra , they have no brain; they are helping. In this way the society is very peaceful, and everyone is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is India's civilization. Now, due to this association of the rākṣasas... Even up to Mohammedan time this civilization was being continued. Mohammedan did not touch the Indian culture. Sometimes by, what is called, fanaticism, there was fight. Not like this. The Arjuna .... Aurangzeb began this. Otherwise, from, what is called, the first emperor? Akbar. Akbar, Jahanghri, then Shajahan, there was no trouble. They did not touch. Even there was some marriage connection. They want to remain as kṣatriya king, that's all. The other things were not interfered. So instead of a Hindu kṣatriya , the Musselman kṣatriya . People were satisfied: ""A kṣatriya ... We have to work. Somebody must be king."" So in this way the Indian people accepted the Britishers. ""All right, you remain king. Don't interfere."" But later on, to exploit the whole country, they began to plan."
Akṣayānanda,Industry.,Prabhupāda," Yes. The industry, railway, and this way, that way, European way of life. And the result was they were kicked out. And India is now trying to perfect..."
Akṣayānanda,The same thing.,Prabhupāda, Same thing. Yes.
Akṣayānanda,Tragedy.,Prabhupāda," Tragedy, yes."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Last year, when Governor Reddy was here, you were talking with him how ""Let there simply be the government's position to check and see that everyone is following their particular religion.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is government's position."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Jayādvaita,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So how would, for example, the government.... In a perfect society, how would the government check to see that the brāhmaṇas are actually practicing, and how would...?; So to be recognized as brāhmaṇas...",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Jayādvaita,"To be recognized, our men will have to be, as you were saying yesterday, perfect gentlemen.",Prabhupāda," Yes, brāhmaṇa means perfect gentleman. Brāhmaṇa means perfect gentleman. A rogue, thief, cannot become brāhmaṇa . (laughs) Brāhmaṇa is perfect gentleman. Who feels for others, that is gentleman. Who does not feel for others, for his sense gratification, he is a rogue. A brāhmaṇa , a gentleman, must feel that ""Why there should be animal killing?"" That is gentleman. If you are killed, you cry and you are.... Hundreds and thousands of animals you are killing on the plea that they have no soul? Lowest class, narādhama. They have been described as narādhama. So narādhama civilization, how he can be happy? There must be frustration."
Devotee (1),"Yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, four or five people stopped me while I was in a bus during the day, and they would stop me and look at me with tilaka and etcetera, and say, ""Why have you given up your Western life and taken to this life?"" (Prabhupāda laughs) They were amazed. And then I had a Bhāgavatam , and I'd show them your picture, and I'd show them the Bhāgavatam and say, "" Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [ Bg . 9.59] , a higher taste."" And then they would appreciate. They would.... They were so impressed by your Bhāgavatam . They looked at your picture, and they'd go, ""Yes, yes, you are right.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, in my Preface I have written that: ""What is the necessity of the human society?"" This is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is required. It is a mistake to understand that we are trying to push on Hindu culture. Where is the Hindu culture? To become a gentleman is Hindu culture? It is for everyone."
Jayādvaita,They think that their paraphernalia makes them gentlemen. If they have a big car and a nice house then they are gentleman.,Prabhupāda," And he may be great rogue, that ""Simply dress yourself nicely; you become gentleman."""
Devotee (1),Usually materially opulent people are puffed up and mean. They're not...,Prabhupāda," Gentleman means that if you go to a gentleman's store, ""Beware of the dog. Beware of the revolver."" This is your culture. And when you go to the airport everyone is searched out, pocket. So who is gentleman? Is that gentleman? There is no gentleman in the world. All rogues and thieves, cheaters, bluffers. Now we are creating gentlemen. Otherwise there is no gentlemen. Here is the proof. If we are gentleman, why we are being checked in the airport? Hm? This is the proof. There is no gentlemen."
Akṣayānanda,Because they're not expecting any gentlemen.,Prabhupāda," That means there is no.... In other words, there is no gentlemen."
Akṣayānanda,Yes. They're only expecting rogues.,Prabhupāda," Sometimes.... In most cases they do not check me. ""This is gentleman."" And there is all..., no gentlemen. And this is the test, how to test a gentleman, that one who is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa .... Or one who is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa , he is gentleman. Kṛṣṇa says that"
Jayādvaita,"Just like that man yesterday, that farmer, was so polite.",Prabhupāda," Yes, he is gentleman. He is Kṛṣṇa conscious. This can be used very nice dako (?) If you stack it nicely, you can use as dako (?). It is very good..."
Jayādvaita; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"[break] Cintāmaṇi gate .; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Vaiṣṇavas in general in Vṛndāvana , are they lamenting for the physical upkeep?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Are the Vaiṣṇavas in general lamenting for the physical upkeep of Vṛndāvana , or are they indifferent?",Prabhupāda," No, it is the business of the government. Vaiṣṇava can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra anywhere. He doesn't require any nice park. Ahaituky apratihatā . For becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, for a serious person, there is no obstacle. Any condition he can do it. [break] ...why there is sannyāsī ? In the Vedic civilization, ultimately sannyāsa . Why? That one must give up the intimate relationship with wife. This is the ultimate position. Brahmacārī , gṛhastha , vānaprastha, sannyāsa ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Tamo- dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgī - saṅgam .,Prabhupāda," That is recommended everywhere. Illicit or legal.... Mahāprabhu has said, asat eka strī - saṅgī : ""Anyone who is attached to woman, he is asat . "" Bas . This is the whole process, how to become detached from the attraction of woman, dhīra . [break] Give up the connection with woman is recommended. So in our society it will be a good test. We are mixed up with men and women. If you in spite of this allurement, if you do not become attracted by woman, then you should know you are paramahaṁsa . Yes. You are worshipable. And this Bhāgavata - dharma is meant for the paramahaṁsas. Paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB 1.1.2 ] . It is especially. Dharmaḥ projjhita . The other different types of regulated system, to become very religious man or to become very expert money-hunter or accumulation of money, dharma , artha , and enjoying sense enjoyment—the whole world is appreciating these men, who is a religious man, who is very much able to satisfy his senses, dozens of cars and three dozen women, naked dance. They are taking this. Dharma artha kāma . And somebody is trying mokṣa , being baffled or dissatisfied: ""These things will not.... I shall become one with."" So dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41 , Cc. Ādi 1.90 ]. So Bhāgavata says, ""These are all kicked out."" Paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB 1.1.2 ] . For the paramahaṁsas. So anyone who is freed from all these allurement, he is paramahaṁsa . And this paramahaṁsa - saṁhitā , it is called, Bhāgavata .... Paramahaṁsa - saṁhitā . Bhāṣyaṁ brahma - sūtrāṇām ** ."
Pṛthu-putra,"Pṛthu - putra : We also should be free from the extension of this, which is profit, adoration, and distinction.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Pṛthu-putra,"Pṛthu - putra : We also should be free from profit, adoration and distinction, which are just extensions of these desires.",Prabhupāda," A Vaiṣṇava does not require any, what is adoration or distinction."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : There's a line of preaching in our society that subtle manifestation of sex attraction is adoration, profit, and distinction.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is.... Mahāprabhu says, tṛṇād api sunīcena ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : There's another path going this way if you'd like to walk some more, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, [break] ...that garden.
Jayādvaita,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Where so many men come there.
Jayādvaita,And it is just near our temple.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Very calm and quiet.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Very pleasant.,Prabhupāda, But we shall go this way?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Devotee (1),"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Yes, it's okay. The car is just back here when you want to go back.; On one tape in America you said that the Westerners have created many, many parks, but because they are so busy trying to work hard for money they cannot take advantage.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),Therefore we will come early in the morning and take advantage.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is our ājagara - vṛtti . Ājagara- vṛtti means we haven't got to work for anything. Everything should be done by others, and we shall take possession of it. (laughter) Just like the Americans. They have earned so much money, and I have gone there and taking possession. I am not more clever than the Americans? (laughs) ""Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and give money. I'll take to India."" What do you think?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You once gave the example of a mouse. The mouse digs a hole, and then the snake comes along and takes the house away from the mouse.",Prabhupāda," Yes. And eats him. The mouse makes very comfortable home by digging, and the snake comes, he enters without any labor, and the mouse is there and he eats it."
Jayādvaita,Free food and free home.,Prabhupāda," Yes, ājagara - vṛtti . What is that? Python. Ājagara- vṛtti and madhukāra - vṛtti . For your necessities of life either you take ājagara - vṛtti or madhukāra - vṛtti . Madhukāra means the fly, honeybee, bees. They take little from this flower, little from this flower, and they stock it, and somebody comes and takes it away. Don't stock. Therefore we have to follow this, that whatever money is coming, spend it for publication or for constructing temple. No account in the bank. Finish."
Jayādvaita,[break] ...is that no one can be contaminated by it.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that blessing for them."

Jayādvaita,"I'm thinking, ""Now I have five dollars. I can purchase something. What shall I buy?""",Prabhupāda," Why? If you don't require anything, why should you purchase? Don't create artificial demand. If you require to purchase something, then purchase. That is material civilization. ""I don't require it; still I want it."" Atyāhāra."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : It is the whole mentality, then.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa: ,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : : The whole mentality is changed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Just like the Kurukṣetra fight. Kṛṣṇa wanted; therefore he fought. Personally he did not want. Hare Kṛṣṇa . (end)
Akṣayānanda,"One boy I recommended for second initiation, but during the fire ceremony he was away on traveling saṅkīrtana for Vṛndāvana . Will he be able to take initiation from you and have the ceremony later, before you go?",Prabhupāda, He can be given.
Akṣayānanda; Yaśodānandana,"And he can offer in the fire later on. Very nice. He's a very good boy.; Prabhupāda, there has been discussion amongst many of the members of the press and the Sanskrit editors regarding the actual place of Nṛsiṁha's pastimes. So I told them that on the occasion of our travel to South India we visited this place Ahobilam, and the paṇḍitas, they have scriptural reference from the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa and the Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa that the place is actually mentioned there, and it has been recognized by Rāmānujācārya and many of the great Ālwār saints. And yourself have already told me twice personally that this was the actual place where it happened. And on top of the mountain there, there is the pillar, iron pillar, which is the symbol of the spot where Lord Nṛsiṁha killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. So for the benefit of all of these devotees, they were just requesting your actual confirmation.",Prabhupāda," Confirmation or no confirmation, Nṛsiṁhadeva is our worshipable Deity, that's all. Why you are bothering where He killed Hiraṇyakaśipu? You worship Him, that's all."
Yaśodānandana; Jayādvaita,"They just wanted...; The question came up because they have some pictures, photographs from these places, and we wanted to know if they were suitable for publishing or not.",Prabhupāda, So why you are bothering with that? Let it be accepted or not accepted. Worship Him.
Akṣayānanda,Not that important.,Prabhupāda, That is the important thing. [break] A man is diseased. He has gone to the physician. So whether is the first duty to investigate wherefrom the disease came or to cure him? Which is important?
Yaśodānandana,To cure.,Prabhupāda," Similarly, Nṛsiṁhadeva might have done this or here or there, but He is our worshipable Deity, that's all. Why bother with unnecessary things? We know Nṛsiṁha is everywhere. Aṇḍāntara stha paramāṇu cayān... That is the conclusion."
Jayādvaita,"We were just afraid that if we published a picture that was not correct, then you might become like Nṛsiṁhadeva.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Jayādvaita,We were afraid that if we were to publish a picture that is not correct...,Prabhupāda," So when it is disputed, why should you publish that picture? It is controversial. You should not print."
Yaśodānandana,The controversy is only amongst the...,Prabhupāda, Whatever it may be. As soon as there is little controversy.... I explained yesterday.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : For dhātun ?(?),Prabhupāda," No, the crow, the crow and the tāla fruit. Somebody said this; somebody said this. Then what is that important thing? Crow and a tāla . You know the kāka -tālīya- nyāya ?"
Yaśodānandana,I never heard that story.,Prabhupāda," There was a tree, tāla tree, and.... tāla tree. So one crow was there, and the tāla fruit fell down. Two paṇḍitas, they began, ""Whether the tāla fruit fell down.... Because the crow sat down on it, therefore fell down."" The other said, ""No, the tāla fruit was falling down, and the crow could not sit on it."" And they began to fight: ""No, this."" He said, ""No this, no this,"" go on."
Akṣayānanda; Yaśodānandana,"Or maybe the crow tried to eat it.; I think in this case it was just a question that they never knew actually what was the actual position. But if Your Divine Grace does not wish anything to be published regarding that place, then we will not do.",Prabhupāda," As soon as there is some controversy, avoid it. That's all. Tāla fruit and crow. You worship Nṛsiṁhadeva. Ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato, yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ . Nṛsiṁhadeva is everywhere."

Yaśodānandana,I missed it. I could not get my cappalas (sandals) off in time. They were lost. But that is okay.,Prabhupāda," No, no, it is not okay. It is not at all okay. Then you go and sit down. Don't.... That is very risky. Then let us go to the road. [break] Maybe."

I don't understand why they would kill animals out of envy.",Prabhupāda," Envy means the cow has got right to live. He does not allow the cow to live. That is envy. You cannot understand this? Suppose you are walking. You have got right to walk, I have got, and if I kill you, you cannot walk. That is envious. Everyone has got right to live. Just like the camel. God has given their food.

Dr. Patel,"No, no, we believe you, sir. But we want a darśana of it. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," So ask. Bring it in the meantime. [break] ...not less than one lakh of devotees, at least, so crowded."

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Where is that?,Prabhupāda, Māyāpura.
Dr. Patel,"That is on holy day, no?",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Dr. Patel,And one on the day you were in London.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,I was told.,Prabhupāda," There also, packed up, so many. Now our temple is going first, even the other temples are so old."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : It was so crowded that you could not even walk on the road coming into our temple.,Prabhupāda, And it was a barren place.
Dr. Patel,"They all come to see the devotees. These foreign devotees, they are enchanted to see them. All these times we were seeing the foreign, foreign, those padres, the Christians. Now we are seeing the sanātana ...",Prabhupāda, And another the thing is that Ramakrishna Mission has constructed temple of Ramakrishna. Nobody goes there. It is lying barren.
Dr. Patel,You were planning to raise a temple in Kurukṣetra ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. I have applied to the government for land, twenty-five acres land."
Dr. Patel,Very big. But is that land available to us?,Prabhupāda," Yes, available. And we have asked government to give us 350 acres of land in Māyāpura to construct Vedic planetarium, 350 feet high. It will require eight crores of rupees minimum. I shall exhibit there all the planetary system, bhurloka, Goloka ..."
Dr. Patel,"Now the Russians also have come to this conclusion, the Russian scientists and astro-physicists, that there are some planets here in the cosmos which actually have people, I mean, has life like human beings. The other day I read a big article on that. Now they agree.",Prabhupāda, They will agree so many things.
Dr. Patel,"They will agree later on that the dialectical materialism is not the right thing, but the dialectical spiritualism is the right thing. What Karl Marx said was wrong. But they have started reading the Vedas and all these, Rāmāyaṇa , Mahābhārata, and...",Prabhupāda, They have got good sympathy for Indian culture.
Dr. Patel,"And if they read it, then Karl Marx teaching will go away.",Prabhupāda," And we are getting enquiries from Russia of our books, about our books. We are getting enquiries. I am sending Gopāla Kṛṣṇa to make market of our books."
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : They have some of our books already in Russia.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"If they start reading Śrīmad- Bhāgavata and Bhagavad- gītā , then Karl Marx will be lost because the sanātana - dharma is a spiritual communism in fact.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : The only difference is that the guru never ends.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel,"Guru dāsa : The guru never goes out of office.; Sanātana is eternal. It is eternal religion. It is the religion of the soul and not of the body, dies. Soul is eternal, so religion is eternal. I am right, sir?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Sanātana means eternal.
Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel,"So this dialectical materialism wherein Karl Marx said that it is a material reaction, chemical reaction in the material, which produces consciousness, it is a falsehood. It is the consciousness keeps the material going. So they will change their opinion now.; Guru dāsa : He's basing philosophy on Hegel, thesis and antithesis.; No, No, Hegel.... Yes, Engels, not Hegel.; Guru dāsa : Thesis and antithesis, and then synthesis.; Yes, yes.; Guru dāsa : But it's a false philosophy.; I mean Hegel did try to improve upon Karl Marx. Really material is important. When the person dies why the body should rot? They every day see.; Guru dāsa : Prabhupāda pointed out the other day that when someone dies, we have all the bodily fluids there, all the organs. Why can't we put it together and make life again?; That's right. So now they have started reading all these, our books. They will now make amendment on it. As you said, they will thesis, synthesis. The present practice of communism in Russia is much more diluted than what it was twenty, thirty years back.",Prabhupāda, It should be.
Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel,"And it will be like India after twenty years.; Guru dāsa : The result is that the biggest problem in Russia is that no one comes to work-absenteeism.; That will be here also. I have been to Ceylon, sir. And in Colombo they are giving free ration to the people. I mean, the rice.",Prabhupāda," There is a story in Bengal. (Bengali) The woman had seven sons. The mother requested first son, ""My dear boy, now I am going to die. Take me to the Ganges side."" He said, ""Why? You have got so many other sons, why you are requesting me?"""
Dr. Patel,"She was calling every one, and nobody took her.",Prabhupāda," And then second son, third.... Everyone said like that, and she died without Gaṅgā . Agar mā gaṅgā .(?) So this.... And everyone has to work. And he thinks that ""Why I shall work? Let him work. No work today."""
Gurudāsa; Dr. Patel,"Guru dāsa : You tell the story about a man beating with a stick, and then the police constable came and said, ""You have beaten him."" ""No, no, no. It was the stick that beat him, not me."" (laughter) No responsibility.; No, but, you see, the sense of possession in human society is more important, because they have no sense of possession.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Even with all our philosophic and all our learning we have the sense of possession of this body which can't leave the moha in it. With all that, sir, then how can they do it?",Prabhupāda," No, higher than that, the sense that everything is possessed by God, that is perfection."
Dr. Patel,"That's right, but...",Prabhupāda," But they are making.... Just like I possess something, now their possession is.... Now you possess something. We are not reaching the point of God. So it is expanded selfishness. It is not perfect. Perfection will come when they understand that everything is possessed by God. Then that is.... Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. When they come to that conclusion."
Dr. Patel,"They have started doing. Even grammar is good. They have started studying Upaniṣad in earnest now. I read an article on that, Russian newspapers, studying the philosophy of Vedas and Upaniṣads.

Is this the disease?",Prabhupāda," Yes. We have to nullify this, that ""I don't possess anything; God possess everything."" Then it is perfection."
Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Dr. Patel,"No, that is why, sir, this communism cannot survive, because they say that afterward the state will vanish. It will evaporate. How can it evaporate without spiritualism there at the back? They have a materialistic ideology and material, I mean, there are changes. There is nothing permanent in material. So the communism, so-called material communism, dialectic materialism of Karl Marx, are not full. [break]; Guru dāsa : Your name is man, and Dr. Patel....

Another person sees it, picks it up and puts it in his pocket. He is dishonest. The third person sees it, picks it up, and seeks out the real owner. So there has to be Kṛṣṇa consciousness; otherwise how do we know who everything belongs to?; That is spiritual concern. And spirit itself.... Kṛṣṇa is....

Dr. Patel,It is a prison house.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Dr. Patel; Gurudāsa,"God wants the prison house to...; Guru dāsa : No, no, first there are so many criminals, and then prison house has to be built. Because there are so many, a bigger prison house has to be built.",Prabhupāda, Just like now medical science is improving means hospital increasing. That means people are becoming more diseased.

This is not civilization. Nāyaṁ deho deha - bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ- bhujāṁ ye [SB 5.5.1 ] . Dog civilization."
Dr. Patel,"Sir, this civilization is degrading because of the cinemas and things. The mothers are the really...",Prabhupāda, And you do not know. Cinema is not cause. Cause is godlessness.
Dr. Patel,But because the godlessness starts from there.,Prabhupāda," No, no, no."
Dr. Patel,Who are the ideals of these women? The cinema actresses. Who were the ideals of our mothers? Sāvitrī and Sītā .,Prabhupāda," There are so many, so many."
Dr. Patel; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Indian; Dr. Patel,"That is very important. This is very important, sir.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : There are many cinemas in America...; (Hindi); I mean, one percent. But many cinemas are there. I have not seen. The people say so.",Prabhupāda," You see, when a man is diseased there are many symptoms of ailments. You cannot say.... You are a physician. You know. You cannot say, ""This is the cause of the disease."" It is.... Real, one disease is there, and there are so many ailments. So you cannot say..."
Dr. Patel: ,You mean the cause of the cause of the cause is godlessness.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Dr. Patel,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Symptoms are there.; Cause of the cause of the cause.,Prabhupāda, Yes. These are only outward...
Dr. Patel,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, Yes. There are.... In logic there are two causes: immediate cause and remote cause. So remote cause is taken into consideration.
Dr. Patel,The important cause is the Kali - yuga .,Prabhupāda, That Vijaya Datta (?) is interested for gurukula.
Girirāja,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Why not construct a big building for gurukula here? The students will be trained up to come here and sporting, having nice bath and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and build up their character. And in Bombay you will get many children, because there are so many rich men. They are not so much concerned to make their children technologist. If they get good education and character, they will give. Technologists they can purchase. Birla, they are not going to be technologist. They purchase technologist. I have seen in many respectable Marwari house. They don't send their children to school. They don't send."
Dr. Patel,After matriculation they go to the office.,Prabhupāda," No matriculation. They engage good paṇḍitas, good teachers, and teach them at home, and, as soon as they are able to read and write and see accounts, immediately engage in the business. They know that ""We can purchase technologist. Why shall I waste time for so-called education, Ph.D., D.A.C.?"" You have seen that Ph.D. in our Vṛndāvana ? Useless. So many Ph.D.'s are useless. Cannot earn their livelihood. I have seen. So what is the use? Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta . Because one has become.... I have seen one Ph.D. chemist in Allahabad. He could not get any job. Then he was manufacturing soap at home and taking it in cycle and going to the market just like ordinary coolie. These so-called educationists, unless they get a good job, they are useless street dog. Useless. They cannot earn even livelihood. Therefore śāstra says, ""Don't try for these things, to increase your economic position. This is already destined. You cannot increase or decrease. Whatever you are destined, you must get it. Try to get Kṛṣṇa consciousness."""
