Pañcadraviḍa,Indian 6:35.,Prabhupāda," [break] ...fire, explain."
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Oh, because people can't see life in fire, they think there's no life in it, so therefore there's no life in the sun. But it's just like the Tata factory. When you see it from a distance there's many planes and fires, but inside there's many people who are working. Therefore just because you can't see life in fire doesn't mean it's not there. We see life in the earth, we see life in the water, we see life in the air, so why not in the fire? Is that all right?",Prabhupāda," Now question, answer."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, one question is that the people in the Tata factory are not actually in the fire.",Prabhupāda," So they are also not in the fire. I say even if it is in the fire, there is no harm because the living soul is not burned to fire. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . Adāhyo 'yam. Dāhya. Dāhya means burned. It is not burned. These are wrong conception. Because they have no conception of the soul, they think bhaṣmi bhūtasya dehasya : ""When the body is burned, then the soul is also burned."" If the soul is burned, then where is the question of tathā dehāntara - prāptiḥ [Bg. 2.13 ] ? How? In the Hindu system they burn the body. So if the soul is also burned, then where is punar janma ? You?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : We can accept that the soul is not burned, but what about the body?",Prabhupāda, Body is burned.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So how can any body live in the sun?,Prabhupāda," So they are.... No, if.... They have got fiery body. As your body is made of earth, the fish body is made of water, and the so many others, different elements, so similarly, there the body is made of earth..., er, fire, fiery body. The so-called scientist, educationist, they.... Everything they conclude according to his own position. Therefore avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. 9.11 ]. They think Kṛṣṇa also ""like me."""
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : The fish is in the water, but the fish is not water.",Prabhupāda," No, fish is not water, but he has got a body suitable for the water."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So the people on the sun have earthly bodies...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : ...who can tolerate heat.,Prabhupāda," Yes. There is no heat. They live.... Just like.... They are not suffocated. They don't feel any inconvenience. They enjoy. Against the waves they enjoy. You cannot go against the waves. They can go, even small fish. You'll find within this there are so many animals, so many. How they are living?"
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Also science cannot explain how it is burning. Where is the fuel supply?,Prabhupāda, (laughs) Yes.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : And there is no smoke, no waste.",Prabhupāda," Nothing. They are all.... Therefore we say simply ""rascals."" We have given this title to them everlastingly. All rascals, mūḍha . Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam . How Kṛṣṇa is working, they do not know. This is Bay of Bengal. Other side is Burma. [break] ...are so strong, it will never be drowned. Eh? (Hindi) The scientist says there is no life. Just disagree with them."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : No life?,Prabhupāda," Scientists, yes, they say there is no life in the sun."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : In the sun.,Prabhupāda," No, they say in every planet there is no life."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, only the earth planet.; Acyutānanda : Well, they have to qualify. They say, ""life as we know it.""",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : They say, ""There is no life as we know it,"" but there's some forms of life that they don't know.",Prabhupāda," So, but no, no. ""As we know,"" but what do you know? You are rascal."
Devotee,They are trying by radio waves to reach people.,Prabhupāda," (Hindi) Sarva - ga , this word is. Sarva - ga . Jivātmā (Hindi)..."
Devotee,[break] ...sending radio signals to faraway galaxies.,Prabhupāda," What is the meaning of their radios? Do you think that their radios are perfect? Do you think so? What, Acyutānanda Mahārāja ? Radio perfect? It is not perfect."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : And I think the demigods and higher beings, they can disturb all their radio attempts.",Prabhupāda," No, apart from that..."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Because they don't want trespassers.,Prabhupāda," ...how you can accept their radio machine are perfect? Because it is made by imperfect person, so how it can be perfect? If the manufacturer is imperfect, how he can make perfect machine? Nothing is perfect."
Acyutānanda; Devotee; Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Actually the United States government has a whole agency for unidentified flying objects that people have seen that they keep secret so as not to frighten the whole America thinking that visitors from other planets will come. But there are many incidents of pilots who fly around in airplanes, who see other strange-looking objects coming at them, flying at them, or people from the ground have seen many.; One guy testified that he was picked up and taken away for four days.; Acyutānanda : Well, that was...",Prabhupāda, What they are? They are police? No. Mounted police?
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Yes, mounted police.",Prabhupāda, A mounted police here?
Acyutānanda; Devotee; Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Saber. Sword.; Oh, it's a stick.; Acyutānanda : Oh, yes, lāṭhī , made like a stick. Yes.",Prabhupāda, [break] Why they are guarding here?
Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : I think for the horses.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They're exercising the horse.; Acyutānanda : [break] ...house in Bengali. Is this where Swami Vivekananda...,Prabhupāda," Yes. After coming back from foreign countries, he made his position here in Madras."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Beautiful building.; Acyutānanda : In Calcutta we have a life member, Veni Śaṅkara Sharma? You stayed at his house?",Prabhupāda," Hm, yes."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So he wrote a book called An Unknown Chapter of the Life of Swami Vivekananda. And in there he openly says that he smoked a hookah and ate meat.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is known to everyone."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda; Yaśodānandana,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Was he praising that?; Acyutānanda : It was.... You know...; In Hyderabad there is a cook who used to cook for the Rāmakrishna Mission, and he said they used to cook any kind of meat.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : I said, ""Did you ever cook human meat?"" He said, ""If they told me, I would have done that also."" There was nothing beyond their diet. ""Anything they told me to cook...""",Prabhupāda," This building belongs to Vivekananda's society, no? Vivekananda house."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What is that?; Acyutānanda : That's Bengali. ""The house of Vivekananda.""",Prabhupāda, (Bengali)
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : They say Swami Vivekananda walked barefoot all over India at some stage of his...,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : That.... This statue here is his life as a wandering sādhu .,Prabhupāda," Who is a sādhu ? Then question is, who is a sādhu ? Who is a sādhu ? You cannot say?"
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious.,Prabhupāda," Api cet sudarācaro bhajate mām ananya - bhāk , sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. 9.30 ] . Unless one is cent percent Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is not a sādhu . Sādhu - bhūṣaṇa ."
Yaśodānandana,This is the vehicle in which we travel.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yaśodānandana,"This vehicle is the vehicle in which we travel to all the different cities for making the life members and arranging all the programs in South India, this vehicle.",Prabhupāda, This is your own?
Yaśodānandana,We are renting.,Prabhupāda, When I was in South Africa...
Indian man (1),South Africa.,Prabhupāda," Yes, Johannesburg. This beach reminds me of that beach. You were with me?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, All statues are crying here.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : This is Annie Besant.,Prabhupāda," [break] ... avatāra here, and she also came from Ireland to become avatāra here."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : I heard how she became interested in the Gītā . She was Christian, and her infant died. So she asked priests, ""Where will this soul go, to heaven or hell? And why? Because he hasn't done anything."" So she was never satisfied with their answers. So then she heard that there is transmigration of the soul. Then she became interested in the Gītā , India.",Prabhupāda, So did she understand?
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Well, only up to transmigration of the soul.",Prabhupāda, She admits.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Yes. [break],Prabhupāda, It was open? If there are any doubt. [break]
Indian man (2),...all practical things...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (2),...political things. Two and two will always be four. But we people don't agree so far.,Prabhupāda, Yes. You want five.
Indian man (2),"(laughter) We want five, correct. Four to make it five.",Prabhupāda," There is a story that a grocer's son was doing business, and when he was given a five-rupees' note, so he was giving four rupees. So the customer said, ""Why you are giving me four rupees?"" ""No, I do not know what is the exchange."" ""No, it is six rupees."" So ""No, father will be angry."" (laughter) Means he knows perfectly well what is five rupees, but he is innocent when he was giving four rupees. And when the customer wanted six rupees, he, ""No, my father will be angry."" [break] ...created a havoc by misinterpreting Bhagavad- gītā , all people. According to their wish, ""Five-rupees note means four rupees,"" by imagination. They have created havoc all over the world. Otherwise everything is there. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. 9.11 ]. If we take Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then whole world becomes immediately happy. But they will not take it. They will manufacture their own, two plus two equal to five or three, not exactly the four."
Indian man (3),So all anxiety and duḥkha have been created by the man himself.,Prabhupāda, Yes. They have created.
Indian man (3),"Nobody else is doing for him, but he created himself.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (3),"And then he said, ""I am in misery. I am in trouble."" Trouble is created by you. Nobody has created.",Prabhupāda," So that is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā , that mind is the enemy and mind is the friend. So we created our mind, enemy or friend, and we suffer for that."
Indian man (3),"Mind is very, very powerful. How to make use of that? Actually mind is using the man; man is not using his mind.",Prabhupāda," In the Bhāgavata it is said, yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ . In another line..."
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Harāv abhakta ?,Prabhupāda," Eh? Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad- guṇā mano -rathenāsato dhāvato bahiḥ [SB 5.18.12 ] . One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has got all the good qualities. Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇaiḥ : ""All good qualities can be manifest."" And harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad- guṇāḥ : ""And one who is not devotee, he has no good qualities."" ""Why? He is so educated."" No, mano - rathena : ""He is hovering over the mind."" Asāto dhāvato bahiḥ : ""He will stick to this asat . "" But the Vedic injunction is asato mā sad gamaya. He cannot go to the real platform of life. Asato bahiḥ . They do not understand that this godless civilization is the root cause of all calamities in the world. (Hindi) Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ . The Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ . Twenty-four hours you have to do that. But where is twenty-four hours? You will not twenty-four minutes. (Hindi)"
Indian man (4); Mahamsa; Acyutānanda,"Book was not in sale yesterday.; That book is not available in India, Prabhupāda.; Acyutānanda : It's a brand new book.",Prabhupāda," No, no, other books, they are not..."
Mahamsa; Indian man (4); Mahamsa,Other books were there. They were on the book table. There was a book table.; Where it is?; Many people were purchasing books. (Hindi),Prabhupāda," Prominent place. (Hindi) Keep in prominent place so that others can see. And any book which is not in stock, you can note down his order so that you can send him later on."
Indian man (5),He will come every day.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (5),Mostly he approaching every member.,Prabhupāda," No, recently we have published very important book, Nectar of Instruction. For common man it is very nice. [break] Yesterday's lecture you liked?"
Indian men; Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Indian man (1),"Yes. (Hindi) [break]; Dhṛṣṭadyumna : ...sleep on the streets. They've arranged this housing, it is very minimal. So what many of these slumdwellers do when people are living on the streets is they come here, and they go back and live on the streets, but they rent out the apartment that the government has given them and they keep the money. They go back and live on the streets.; This houses? This is all rented by the government and given free of charge to the poor to clear the slums.",Prabhupāda," Therefore Bhāgavata says,"
Indian man (1),(Hindi),Prabhupāda," (Hindi) Just like Vivekananda philosophy, daridra - nārāyaṇa . (Hindi) How you can change this? (Hindi) First duty is, first of all enlighten them with knowledge. That is required, not by external bodily comforts. (end)"
Keśavalāl Trivedi,Keśavalāl Trivedi.,Prabhupāda," Trivedi, Mr. Trivedi, yes. So, who is independent? This is our question. Who is independent? Do you know any man who is independent or any animal or any...?"
Keśavalāl Trivedi,No.,Prabhupāda, So why they are thinking independently?
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Unless we have got the identity, correct identity, we cannot be independent.",Prabhupāda, What is this?
Mahāmṣa,"This is keys for the lock, Prabhupāda. It fell down.",Prabhupāda, I think somebody has left.
Keśavalāl Trivedi; Mahāmṣa,"Yes, there is lock and chain.; This way, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Which way? This is natural lake or...?
Mahāmṣa; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Mahāmṣa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes, Prabhupāda. It never dries up. It stays full all year round.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Gigantic. Like the Hyderabad lake.; It looks bigger than the Hyderabad lake.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Bigger.",Prabhupāda," [break] So if you are not independent, what is the value of your thinking independently?"
Keśavalāl Trivedi,Absolutely none. None.,Prabhupāda, But everyone is thinking independently.
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Yes. That is māyā . That is the māyā , that which is not.",Prabhupāda," They are making plans, theories, ""ism."" What is the value of this?"
Keśavalāl Trivedi,Absolutely none.,Prabhupāda," Therefore everything is becoming failure. So preach this truth to the world, that ""You are all rascals. Why you are thinking independently?"" Huh ? ""Why I am rascal?"" ""Because you are thinking independently. That is the proof that you are a rascal."" Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa- tantryām uru - dāmni baddhāḥ [SB 7.5.31 ] . Īśa- tantryām uru - dāmni baddhaḥ . And they are thinking independently."
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Baddha we have got, and still we are thinking...",Prabhupāda," Baddha - jīva , every moment he is under the strict laws of nature. Generally they think that.... They speak also. ""I think."" Do they not say? ""I think,"" as if he is independently thinking. What you can think? Hm? Acyutānanda Mahārāja , why do they say, ""I think,"" ""In my opinion""? What is the value of your opinion?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, I have a certain amount of experience, and with my intelligence and my mind and my scientific method, I can put all that together and come out with some practical solution which I can work on.",Prabhupāda," That you cannot, because you are not independent. Uru - damni baddhaḥ . If you are tied hands and legs with strong rope, how you can think of ""I shall become free in this way. I shall become free...?"" But your hands and legs are tied up, so why do you think foolishly that you shall become free in this way, you shall become free this way? First of all open this, the tightening knot; then you plan that ""I shall become..."" But there is no such chance. So what is the value of your thinking like that?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, relatively speaking, it's better to do...",Prabhupāda," That is another foolishness. Because you are so rascal, you do not know that ""I cannot move even an inch and I am making plan."" That is the proof that you are a rascal."
Keśavalāl Trivedi; Harikeśa,Tena vina tṛṇam api na calati . That is the way.; Harikeśa : But why are people in the capital...,Prabhupāda," Therefore we call them all rascals. That is our confirmation of our statement. Mūḍhas, you all rascals, without any exception. Hm? The other day the high-court judge, he's supposed to be the most intelligent person within this state, high-court judge, and he was talking so many nonsense."
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Because he thinks he knows, he does not know.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Keśavalāl Trivedi,One who thinks he knows...,Prabhupāda," Manyamāna, manyamāna. He is thinking he is very intelligent."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : While he was saying that, I was thinking, ""I hope I never have him for a judge.""",Prabhupāda, You'll find everywhere such.
Acyutānanda; Keśavalāl Trivedi; Acyutānanda; Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Acyutānanda : Ultimately he was saying, ""It is not Kṛṣṇa or this. It is some 'something.' That is the reality.""; He was thinking that he was bringing about some synthesization.; Acyutānanda : Yes.; And that he was bringing...",Prabhupāda, [break] ...with this land also? No. [break] ...this building?
Mahāmṣa,"I think it is a school, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Oh. [break] He does not know. He does not say that ""certainly school."" ""It may be."""
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Well, if I'm convinced it's a school, it's a school. I mean, the only thing that really matters is my perception of that thing.",Prabhupāda," You learn from him that it is school. Before that, you did not know. Therefore you have to learn. That experience is valuable, when you learn it."
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : Yes, but the only thing that makes it a school...",Prabhupāda, You cannot imagine by seeing a building that it is a school. You cannot imagine that. That is foolishness.
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : But all the people inside, they are also imagining that it's a school.",Prabhupāda, So that is all...
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Just like if there is a pen. If I use it to kill someone, it is a weapon. If I use it to mix something, it is an instrument. If I use it to write with, then it's a pen. So it is not a pen. It is not a weapon. It is my idea that I impose on the object that makes it what it is.",Prabhupāda," No. No. Your idea, that is foolishness. But you learn from a teacher that this is pen; this is not a weapon. You have to learn it. If you don't learn it, then you will go on making experiment whether it is pen or it is weapon or it is this or that. Go on. But it will never come to any conclusion."
Mahāmṣa,Like giving a child a pen who does not know...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Mahāmṣa,...that we have to write with it. He has to be taught that we have to write.,Prabhupāda, Everywhere you have to learn from the perfect person. Then his knowledge is perfect. So our proposition is that: learn from Kṛṣṇa and you get perfect knowledge.
Keśavalāl Trivedi; Harikeśa,"That is why he is jagat guru .; Harikeśa : We've invented this pen, so we can invent how to use the pen.",Prabhupāda," You have not invented. Some experienced more than yourself, he has done. You have been given the pen to use it for that purpose."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Yes. Whenever some scientist does something, the whole nation of that scientist takes the credit. That is another idea. They say, ""We made the pen,"" or something. Everyone in India takes the credit.",Prabhupāda," That is animalism. Dehātmā- buddhiḥ . ""I belong to some particular body, and he belongs to the same body or same nation. Therefore we become..."" Instead of ""I,"" we become ""we."""
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Recently there was an atomic scientist whose all major education was in America and Europe, and he won a Nobel Prize award...",Prabhupāda," That is the tendency everywhere. The Britishers.... You go to the Parliament and Westminster Abbey. They have kept all the statues of Sir Isaac Newton and this Churchill, this.... Mean, they want to show that ""It is only our nation who has produced all these intelligent persons."""
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Yes, yes. From ""I-ness"" to ""we-ness.""",Prabhupāda," [break] This is basis of Gītā . Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā [Bg. 4.34 ] . Learn from the real person, tattva - darśinaḥ , who has seen, who has actual experience of the truth. Learn from him. The Gītā never recommends that you imagine and make your theories. Never said. That is the Vedic culture. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsur śreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21] . This is the way. Take lesson from Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative. Then you will get experience. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What is the use of imagining?"
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : I mean, after all, all this talk about God was simply there because of man's desire to explain the unknown. He saw a thunderbolt and...",Prabhupāda," It is unknown to the rascal man. It is known to the sober man. (laughter) He should become sober instead of becoming a rascal. That is required. Vidyā - vinaya - sampanne [Bg. 5.18 ] . Ācāryavān puruṣo veda : ""He knows, who has accepted the ācārya . "" This is Theosophical Society, I think. Huh ? That trademark. Or Rāmakrishna Mission."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, Salvation Army.",Prabhupāda," Salvation Army, oh."
Mahāmṣa; Harikeśa; Acyutānanda,"This is also school.; Harikeśa : Actually we're the only Salvation Army.; Acyutānanda : [break] ...the authority of a authority. We're accepting his authority, but his experience comes from his direct perception, which comes back to...",Prabhupāda," We don't take such authorities, who takes experience from others. We take authority who is..."
Keśavalāl Trivedi,Experienced.,Prabhupāda," Automatically. (sic:) Parāsya bhaktir vividhaiva śruyate svabhāvikī jñāna - bala - kriyā ca . Svabhāva ..., you can.... Just like if you ask me how to do something, if I say, ""Yes, you do like this,"" svabhāvikī . I have got by nature knowledge how to do it perfectly. That is going on. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram [Bg. 9.10 ]. Kṛṣṇa is dictating that ""You do like this."" So, you see, everything is coming perfect. From the nim seed a nim tree will come. It is so nicely made by Kṛṣṇa - bījo 'haṁ sarva - bhūtānām [ Bg 7.10 ]—that it will come nim tree, not mango tree. The chemicals are so combined. You do not know what is there, a small seed, baṭa vṛkṣa . And a huge banyan tree will come out, not other tree. That is knowledge. He has given the whole, I mean to say, operation in a small seed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, bījo 'haṁ sarva - bhūtānām . There is no mistake. You simply take it and cultivate. You'll get the result."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : So that principle, which makes things grow, the Īśopaniṣad says, so 'ham asmi : ""I am that principle.""",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : The Īśopaniṣad says in the ultimate śloka , so 'ham asmi : ""I am that.""",Prabhupāda," Asmi means ""It is my energy. It is my energy."""
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, it says...",Prabhupāda," If I say that ""I am ISKCON,"" what is the wrong there? Because I have created this; therefore I say, ""ISKCON means I. I am ISKCON."" So what is the wrong there? It is like that. By energy of Kṛṣṇa , everything has come out. Therefore says, ""I am this, I am this, I am this, I am this."" Vibhūti - bhinnam . Because everything.... Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1 ]. Everything has come from Kṛṣṇa ."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, the Īśopaniṣad says that you are that principle. Īśopaniṣad says the principle which is lighting the sun...",Prabhupāda," Yes, a devotee accepts.... That we accept."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : ...that ""I am that principle. The being that is lighting the sun, I am that.""",Prabhupāda, I do not follow you.
Acyutānanda; Harikeśa,"Acyutānanda : So 'ham asmi . That sixteenth...; Harikeśa : ""Like unto the sun, as am I.""",Prabhupāda," Oh. Yes, so 'ham asmi —because I am part and parcel."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, but it says ""I am that, "" not that ""I am part of that.""",Prabhupāda, No.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : ""I am that."" ""Like unto...""",Prabhupāda," If it is said, it can be accepted, because I am qualitatively the same."
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Quantity, much difference.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, but the direct statement...",Prabhupāda," I am.... If I say, ""I am Indian,"" what is the wrong there, if I say, ""I am Indian""?"
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : That is something else.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Not something else.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : But to directly accept the śruti , it says you are that same principle.",Prabhupāda," And therefore you have to learn from the guru . And if you directly take, then you remain a fool. Therefore you require a guru . That is the instruction of śruti . Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . You have to learn śruti . You have to come to a guru ."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, but this is after that. The ultimate conclusion of that Upaniṣad , śruti , the authority, is that you are that same principle.",Prabhupāda," Yes, I am the same principle. Nityo nityānām."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Well, nothing can be more eternal than another eternal.",Prabhupāda, Everyone is eternal.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : It is contradictory then. Nityo nityanānāṁ. You cannot say that one thing is more eternal than another thing.,Prabhupāda," No, no. That is not the point. Everyone is eternal."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So how can one be more eternal than...,Prabhupāda," As God is eternal, so you are also eternal."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Then why the distinction...?,Prabhupāda," But because you have accepted this material body, you are foolishly thinking that you are not eternal. Otherwise, as God is eternal, you are also eternal."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Then why should one be distinguished from another if they are both eternal?,Prabhupāda," Just like the sun distinguished from the sunshine, but qualitatively heat and light is there. But because sunshine is there, you cannot say sun is there. That you cannot say. Mat - sthāni sarva - bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ [Bg. 9.4 ] . Clearly said."
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"I think, Swamijī, you explained this, and I could draw rationality from it, that ""I am īśa , but not I am sarveśa. I am ātman but not Paramātman.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"""I am aṁśa but not Paramāṁśa. """,Prabhupāda, That is explained in other.... You have to take reference. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bs. 5.1] . I am also īśvaraḥ . That I explained so many times. But that does not mean I am paramesvara . Paramesvara is Kṛṣṇa . What is this building? Hm?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : This is more of that Christian...,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda; Keśavalāl Trivedi,"Acyutānanda : Same seal as the Christian...; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What about that?; Acyutānanda : This is a mosque.; Ahaṁ brahmāsmi I was not able to explain till I heard Swamijī on the first day at Rajeswara in Mandapur.(?) That fits in. Otherwise Māyāvādīns, ""All right, but Śaṅkarācārya saying, ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Why you say no?"" Because so many persons ask me question. And when I was confronted, I was not able to say that. But the way the mukti was defined, mukti , yes, and in the lecture, and īṣa , sarveśa, all those things— ātmā , Paramātmā , aṁśa , Paramāṁśa —there I found that it can be explained. Because so many persons, they ask in public meeting like Lions Club, where we take up these topics. Then we feel at our wit's end. But now I think I can explain them.",Prabhupāda, So that day my explanation was all right?
Keśavalāl Trivedi; Acyutānanda; Keśavalāl Trivedi; Acyutānanda,"Yes, that is how I feel. And that is what will apply also to Acyutānanda Swami's question also, I think.; Acyutānanda : No, I'm just fencing.; No, no, that's all.... I know.; Acyutānanda : So Durga is higher than Viṣṇu because Viṣṇu required Durga to awaken Him from the yoga - nidrā to kill Madhu and Kaitabha . So she controls Him.",Prabhupāda," Yes, if I ask my servant that ""You ask me to get up at seven o'clock,"" that does not mean.... (laughter)"
Keśavalāl Trivedi,"No, some of these things we could not follow. As a matter of Madhu - Kaitabha - vadha , I have read it several times.... (end)",Prabhupāda, These things are not available in the Western countries. They do not know all these.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I don't think that there has ever been a personality who has ever given such a great gift to the Western world as yourself, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes, actually that is the fact, but let them appreciate, that's all."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Gradually I think they all will. Some are now...,Prabhupāda," No, they are intelligent. First..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The thing is, it seems to me, that we are flooding so many books that they must become Kṛṣṇa conscious.",Prabhupāda," (laughing) Yes, they have no alternative than to read these books."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Practically now it is commonplace that every day when our men go out, supposing each man meets in a day a thousand people or five hundred people, always, without a doubt, at least one or two of the people he's met, they already have another book, and they are taking a second or third book.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Many of them have two or three volumes of Caitanya - caritāmṛta or Bhāgavatam . And although they may not read it, their children are reading it.",Prabhupāda, Somebody is reading.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, yes. I made a study. I asked the men in our party, when they were all gathered, to raise their hand if they had received a book before joining our party, and every single one of them had gotten a book before joining the movement—without exception. They were attracted through reading a book or a magazine.",Prabhupāda, I talked with that police officer. He has published. In Chicago.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ""Crime: What to do?""; Harikeśa : ""Why and what to do?""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ""Why and what to do?""",Prabhupāda," Every paper, there are so many papers. Education so much advanced, and everyone is a criminal. Hmm. Have saṅkīrtana , then lecture."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : You chant?,Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa only. [break] That is foolishness. Why our men does not become ready before four o'clock and have maṅgala ārati and kīrtana ? If our habits are not changed, then what is the use of spending so much money? [break]"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In no way can anyone say that they're independent. There is no possibility. At every moment one is dependent. And if anyone says they aren't, they are simply foolish rascals. We have to challenge everyone in the world on this point, ""You cannot be independent."" He is pointing out, saying that even in politics, the politicians like Indira think that they are independent, and Prabhupāda was saying that Munshibhai Raman, he fought so hard for his country's independence, Bangladesh. But in one hour, when the soldiers came, they killed him and every single family member, not sparing anyone. But he thought he was independent. He thought his country had become independent. But in one hour it was all wiped away.",Prabhupāda," So where is your independence? What is the answer? At any moment you have to die. Even Munshibhai Raman or Mussolini or big, big, so..., Napoleon."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Franco. There was that Franco.,Prabhupāda," Yes, everyone. He was given horse urine to drink, Napoleon. Such a great hero, but he had to drink horse urine. This Englishman after Battle of, what is that? Waterloo. When he was arrested, when he was asking water, he was given horse urine. Because everyone was very, very angry. Napoleon became just like Hiranyakasipu. They were threatening their children: ""Oh, he, Bona, is coming. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep."" He became so much.... He was known as Bona. You do not know all these things?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Whole Europe became threatened, Napoleon. And there must be some reaction. And when he was under custody he was treated like an.... So where is independence? He had to drink horse urine as reaction of his atrocities. Hitler committed suicide and finished himself. Mussolini was forced to be killed. Gandhi was killed. And they are fighting for independence. You know this Sydney? Sydney? You know why the city is known as Sydney?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No.,Prabhupāda," Sir Philip Sydney, a great commander, during the fighting time, when he was shot, he asked for water, and the water was not supplied and he died. Now, he was very generous man. He was the commander. Water was brought, and at the same time another soldier was being carried. He was also going to die. He was looking for the water. So immediately he said, ""This water give him. Give him,"" and he died. He was very generous. He knew that ""I am going to die. If he can be saved, give him this water."" So that Sydney, Sir Philip Sydney, his name. Melbourne, it is also named after great soldier. So where is your independence? If you are thinking independently and doing things independently, then is it not foolishness? Hm? Why don't you answer? You don't want to be foolish? Suppose within the prison walls, if you want to do things independently, is it possible?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, you're always dependent.",Prabhupāda," You'll be put into further sufferings as soon as you violate the rules and regulation of the jail. You'll be put to a further term of suffering. Just like they are independently trying to avoid pregnancy, and the same man who has killed his own child, or same mother, he is being killed within the womb. Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. 3.27 ] . Nature will not tolerate this. In India still these things are not happening because they are not so advanced to use all these contraceptive method. But in Europe, America, it has become a common affair to kill the child within the womb."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It is starting here also.,Prabhupāda," Yes, gradually. As soon as you kill, then you must be killed. This law is there: life for life. So where is your independence? Independence means you are inviting more sufferings, that's all. You go on, declare your independence. We are the only sane man. We have accepted that ""We have no independence."" Here Kṛṣṇa is asking. ""Let me surrender unto..."" That's all. So we have to convince the people, ""Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very scientific. You are foolishly rascal. You are trying to be independent. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa is asking to surrender. You do that."" That will make him happy. In many varieties of ways we have to convince them and prove that ""You are foolishly thinking that there is independent, so-called scientific advancement, and only promising, 'Yes, in future we shall be like this, be like this.' "" What is future? Just take account of your present position. Where is the history that you have...? If in the past something like that happened, then you can expect future. But in the past, the whole world history, there was no independence. [break] ...clearly says, ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate : [Bg. 3.27 ] ""These rascals, out of false ego, and vidmūḍha, foolishly declaring that 'I am the doer of everything. I can do everything independently.' "" Kartāham iti manyate . Manyate means ""falsely think."" Actually, he is nothing but a small particle. This egotism is the root cause of suffering. Discuss all these things amongst yourselves and preach and inform these rascals, so-called civilized scientists and philosopher. That is preaching. We have to present the truth in such a way that they will be convinced, ""Yes."" Within fifteen minutes the plane in Arabia, fifty-three men fell. Within fifteen.... It takes fifteen minutes to die. That's all. Where is your independence? You have invented so many nice machine, but when there is order from superior, ""You nonsense, your machine.... You die immediately,"" what you can do? So why don't you accept there is superior? Hm? Why do they not accept? What is the reasoning? You cannot say?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Vimūḍhātmā.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That accept. If he accepts that he's vimūḍha , then it is an advance. Just like a dog is barking, ""Yow, yow, yow, yow!"" You just run towards him with a stick, he'll immediately go away and stop. Because he is dog, he is thinking, ""I am independent. I can bark like this."" And as soon as.... Simply one stick-finish his independence. You'll find psychologically, however a big dog he may be, if you just run towards him with a stick, he'll go.... (laughs) He knows that ""When this man will strike me with the stick, I cannot do anything."" He knows it very well. Sometimes falsely if you touch the ground, he will go away. Everyone is thinking independently. He is forming a party, ""revolution,"" ""ism,"" and so many things. All of them are foolish rascals. They do not see the history. Stronger men than ourselves, Napoleon, Hitler, this man, that man, Gandhi —everyone is finished. So where is.... What is the value of my planning again? [break] There are many gods?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Hm?,Prabhupāda," Vivekananda. He is follower of Vivekananda. [break] ...Vivekananda's house was made, say, eighty years before. So what is the use of this house? It is standing and it is covered with matches.... What is called? Straw? What is called?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Lines.(?),Prabhupāda," No, no. Dorma, we say dorma. The bamboo cut into slice and open..."
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Citar. Citar.,Prabhupāda, Citar?
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : Like the roof in the other place in Madras.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is English? Citar it is called?
Harikeśa,"Harikeśa : No, Hindi.",Prabhupāda," English, what is the English? They do not use it."
Hariśauri,"A straw roof, they call that thatching. Thatch.",Prabhupāda," Thatching, yes. That is right. So the windows are thatched. So where is the production? Vivekananda is standing as preacher. So where is the preachers? People should have gone there in hundreds; there should have been some program. So where is the program? Simply ""Vivekananda house."" Lick up the house. [break] ...rows of statues on the beach, many statues—for passing stool by the crows. I have seen in Calcutta one statue of Sir Asutosh Mukherjee. So in the morning, on the day of the birth anniversary, in the morning the municipal sweepers with their brush, they will rub it to cleanse the solidly stuck-up crow's stool with water. It will be done for three, four hours. Then in the evening, big, big men will come, gather, and offer him garland one after another, just like they were offering me. In this way the meeting will be held. In the morning it is brushed with the sweeper's street brush, and in the evening it is offered garland. I have seen it. Here also I see that she has kept Kṛṣṇa's mūrti outside. It is aparādha ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hariśauri,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are not kṛṣṇa -bhaktas, these people, at all.; Even that tulasī tree around the corner, they have clipped to shape it, cut all the branches.",Prabhupāda, They have no guidance.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Last night when we were reading, they all left, especially on that point of following the regulative principles: no meat, crabs, fish, eggs. They all got up and walked out.",Prabhupāda," You said that the same cooking place will have to do, where they are cooking meat?"
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : They're not cooking it now.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Harikeśa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Harikeśa : They're not doing that now.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...is not planning. When he comes here he is determined that he will not eat in anyone's home.,Prabhupāda, That is very good.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He says that he finds it very.... From reading your books it is very clear that Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very careful and strict to only eat prasādam cooked by proper persons.,Prabhupāda," No, purchase from Jagannātha temple. People would come to offer Him prasādam , so what is the cost of the prasādam , that was taken, and He purchased. Formerly, the system was, there was no hotel, but there were temples. You go and you can purchase very cheap price. I went with my father in my childhood in a place. My father would never take food at anyone's house or in the hotel. He will find out some temple and pay them and take prasādam . Still there are many temples. So I was about ten years old at that time, say, seventy years ago. So he paid two annas to the pūjārī and he gave us so much. It can be eaten by five, six men. Kicheri, vegetables, varieties. So much. Two annas."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : There's a nice temple in Nabadwip that does that, the Govinda temple in Nabadwip. When I was going to purchase the land in māyāpura, the Mr. Das, the lawyer, and I, we would take our meals at this temple. Every day he would purchase. He would give a little.",Prabhupāda," Yes, still there are."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They had arrangement like this. At least a hundred people were taking, respectable people.",Prabhupāda, Acchā .
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's a very big temple, that temple. Of course, I don't know how bona fide the persons who speak at night are, but every night there are speakers, and many people coming. It's a very good temple. I was very impressed by it. Nice rooms for people to stay upstairs, very active, always being cleansed by people.",Prabhupāda, That is temple.

Excuse me, I forgot it. So you are pāmara . """
Indian man,"And it is so. As a matter of fact, it is so.

But you have now completed the sentence. ""You know lot of things, but because you are pāmara , therefore this thing has come prominent."""
Indian man,That is the proviso.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is the proof that you are a pāmara .
Indian man; Yaśodānandana,"In my own way, if they challenge us and they are convincing, because to the audience it has to be said.

We as a matter of fact champion that cause. But afterwards, when we realized that it is not sampradayic, we have given it up. Therefore..."" Then his conduct....

Now, just like we go to the temple to see the Deities. Many millions of people are coming, but everyone knows that this is made of stone. But they are going to see the stone?"
Indian man,There is God in it.,Prabhupāda," Huh ? They are going to see the stone? So arcye viṣṇau śilā - dhiḥ . Anyone who thinks like that....

Indian man,There is something; there is nothing.,Prabhupāda," So it is better. Just like one man said that ""I have lost fifty thousand this year."" His friend said, ""You are still fortunate, because you had fifty thousand. But I have no fifty paisa even."""
Indian man,So there is something. Here nothing.,Prabhupāda," ""So you are so fortunate that you could suffer the loss of fifty thousand, but I have nothing to lose."""
Indian man,"But that is for a discriminating man. Here it is an ignorance, asuya , envy. When Acyutānanda Swami was addressing one man (he) said, ""Why always have Hare Kṛṣṇa , Hare Kṛṣṇa ? We can have Hare Christ also."" Same answer as Your Holiness gave, he said, ""Yes, yes, you can have it. Whoever says.... We don't say no.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This is a tuberculosis hospital.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee (2),"Prabhupāda, they said that if Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries, why didn't He go there Himself? That's what they told us.",Prabhupāda, So He left the credit for me. (laughter)
Devotees,Jaya ! Haribol !,Prabhupāda, He loves His devotee more than Himself.
Harikesa,Harikesa : Why didn't Kṛṣṇa kill everybody at the Battle of Kurukṣetra ?,Prabhupāda, Yes.

And somebody, ""Oh, here is some money""; he takes it. And somebody takes it but offers to you. Who is the better man?"
Indian man,The person offering.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That who takes it and puts in the pocket, he is a thief. And who takes it and offers to you, he is sincere friend. So we can use everything only for Kṛṣṇa . And therefore we are friend to Kṛṣṇa . And you are thief. Kṛṣṇa's property you are using unauthorizedly. Therefore you are a thief."
Devotee (3),"[break] The Christians say that God has given us certain things to enjoy. Just like I was talking to one Christian about eating meat, and he said, ""Well, I enjoy eating meat.""",Prabhupāda," So, the tiger will say he will enjoy you. Why do you protest against the tiger?"
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : In the Bible it says that everything was for the enjoyment of man. Man is sovereign over the animals.,Prabhupāda, Enjoyment does not mean that you kill him.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Enjoy means protection. It means protecting, not eating.",Prabhupāda," Go- rakṣya . You protect the cows and take the best food in the world, milk. That is enjoyment. Not foolishly to eat the cow."
Indian man; Yaśodānandana; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Indian man; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"I am reminded, Swamijī, of one day, the tussle between two Muslims.

So on one platform I was the organizer. This high-court judge had been invited, and he began to say animal kingdom is meant for exploitation by human being. And this man flared up: ""Where do you get in Koran? You are talking some nonsense, though you are high-court judge."" It was a problem for me how to manage this high-court judge, presiding high-court judge, and this man who was a public man. Then he convinced that ""Don't say all these things. Where are the passages? In Arabia this eating of goat was a necessity then. That is how it was. Otherwise human beings cannot exploit. You withdraw. Otherwise I will make this meeting a pandemonium."" That is how he did it, and he succeeded. (laughter) He succeeded, very same. That Fossil, he succeeded. And this idiot who was appointed by Rajajiv, high-court judge, he could not convince. I said, ""Why do you talk about controversial subjects when you do not know?"" But he was a presiding judge. He thought, ""Whatever I talk is sense."" That chief justice asked me, ""How have I spoken?"" So he wanted certificate from me afterwards. I said that ""If that incarnation of (indistinct), if you should have left, that would have been better.

Indian man,"And another question reply was also very convin..., that all other are gods, but He is Godhead. That is very clinching expla.... Some of these things are really direct replies.",Prabhupāda, And actually that is fact.
Indian man,"This was.... Even Acyutānanda said the other day. Somebody asked us that question, ""Why not 'God conscious'? Why do you want 'Kṛṣṇa'?"" He also said the same thing. [break] ""What is the difference between thieving the butter and other things by Lord Kṛṣṇa and thieving by us?"" I said ""The thieving is thieving."" I said, ""How can there be theft of...""

Indian man; Acyutānanda,"That is what.... In forensic language it is called abet, abetted. The very owner abets, ""It is kind of you to have committed theft of this.""

There were almost ten thousand people there.",Prabhupāda, There is good potency in South India.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Oh, yes, it is very promising.",Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] Jaya .
Mahāmṣa,He is secretary of our committee here and president of the Rotary Club in Nelore.,Prabhupāda, So your arrangement was very nice. Thank you. Hm. Where is that wrapper? These cottages are very nice.
Mahāmṣa,[break] His father is donating for Kṛṣṇa's Deity.,Prabhupāda, Oh. And who is donating for the temple?
Mahāmṣa; Harikeśa; Acyutānanda,"They will.... We will comment. I will comment.; Harikeśa : Is there a path that goes down there?; Acyutānanda : It's shallow. [break] ...that the Vaiṣṇavas say that the gold ring is smaller in quantity than the gold mine, but the only way in this material world.... That is only a material example, because something can be separated from the general mass because there are many different elements. You can tell the difference between a gold ring and a gold mine because there is air and space. But there is ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti, there is only Brahman , so you cannot say that there is a big Brahman and a part-and-parcel Brahman . The words ""part and parcel"" you have only written into the śrutis for your own...",Prabhupāda," So that is not your rascal's imagination. It is spoken by the Lord Himself. Mamaivāṁśaḥ. He is not rascal like you, that He will say something which is mistaken."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, that is only during His avatāra He says that.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. He says like that; we have to accept it. Bhagavad- gītā as it is.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : In the lower stage.,Prabhupāda," Lower stage not.... That is.... You are in the lower stage. You cannot understand. But what He says, that is right. Mamaivāṁśaḥ, sanātana , ""eternally amara . "" It is not that made aṁśa at the present time. Sanātana . From.... From the very beginning."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Then it is contradictory.,Prabhupāda," No contradictory. It is not contradictory. He says, mamaivāṁśo jīva - bhūtaḥ [Bg. 15.7 ] , that ""These jīvas, they are eternally My aṁśa . "" It is not that because now in the material world it has become fragmented."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : How can there be any truth outside the Lord?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : How can there be any truth separate from the Lord, like a gold ring separate from the mine?",Prabhupāda," Yes, but whatever the Lord says, that is truth. Not your statement is truth."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, just like if I say...",Prabhupāda, You cannot say.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : ...you should dress warmly. You should dress warmly now.,Prabhupāda," No, no. You cannot say."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : And then I come in the summer, and you still are dressing warmly-it's for time and circumstance, only immediately.",Prabhupāda," No. That is spiritual fragment, eternally existing. Nityo nityānāṁ cetana ... There are always plural number and singular number."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : How can there be any truth separate from the Lord? Eka brahma .,Prabhupāda," No, it is not separate. You are thinking separate."

Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : We go directly from the śruti , ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.",Prabhupāda, Then you don't accept Bhagavad- gītā .
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : There cannot be anything in between.,Prabhupāda, Then you don't accept Bhagavad- gītā .
Acyutānanda; Yaśodānandana,"Acyutānanda : We also accept. During avatāra these things may go on, but actually...; Ultimately everything will become one. The jīvātmā will become one with the Paramātmā . The Advaitavādī...",Prabhupāda, It is already one. That is Viśiṣṭādvaitavāda.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Yes, but it appears differently.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : But actually there is no difference.,Prabhupāda, No.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So we are one with God.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So we are one.,Prabhupāda," Why one? You are one and different, bhedābheda, acintya -bhedābheda- tattva , simultaneously one and different. Just like this. This is one and different. The children have come from the body—that is one—but still, they are different. Even in the hogs and pigs the acintya -bhedābheda- tattva is there. [break] The word should be nābheda sanātana ."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : [break] It is different only during the manifestation of prakṛti , but actually it is not...",Prabhupāda," Just like in Vṛndāvana . They are one, but still, there are trees, there are flowers, there are water, there are calves, there are cows, there are gopīs, but they are all one. Ānanda-cinmaya- rasa -pratibhāvitābhiḥ [Bs. 5.37] . All of them are ānanda -cinmaya- rasa . Nirviśeṣavādīs..., it is not nirviśeṣavāda. Sa - viśeṣa . What is this? [break] Just see, it is already ""Hare Kṛṣṇa ,"" known."
GopālaKṛṣṇa,"Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : Foundation was laid in December '74, but no work has been done since then.",Prabhupāda, So why not let us have this land? We can develop.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Very nice land, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Right by the lake.; Acyutānanda : It already has our name. If the Bhagavad- gītā is in the Mahābhārata —that's itihāsa —how did it get the name Upaniṣad , Gītopaniṣad ?",Prabhupāda," Because it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa . Itihāsa also Vedic literature. Pañcama - veda , Mahābhārata, for understanding of the common man. Strī - śūdra - dvija - bandhūnāṁ trayi na śruti - gocarāḥ [ SB 1.4.25 ] . Woman, śūdra , and dvija - bandhu , they cannot understand directly the Vedas."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : But even Bhisma , when he was on the battlefield, he said, ""I have given up my bheda - jña , "" so he became one.",Prabhupāda," One you are already. Because you are foolish, you cannot understand. That is abheda . I am not different. Just like my finger is not different from me. If the finger thinks, ""I am different from the body,"" that is ignorance."
Yaśodānandana,"Just as we say that ignorance consists of not understanding the difference between the jīva and the Paramātmā , the Māyāvādīs say that ignorance means to understand the difference between jīva and Paramātmā .",Prabhupāda," So then they difference. They admit that there is difference, if they say like that, that ""There is difference."""
Yaśodānandana,"But they say that oneness, that is the real knowledge.",Prabhupāda," No, no. That's all right. But why they say ""different""?"
Yaśodānandana,"They say to see that our vision of difference, that our vision of difference, that is ignorance. When we understand the jīvātmā to be different from God, from Bhagavān , that is ignorance.",Prabhupāda, No. No.
Yaśodānandana,That your vision of seeing God...,Prabhupāda," Yes. So we admit that, that when we see that ""I am separate from..."" Then the same example: If the finger thinks that it is separate from the body, that is ignorance, because the finger is required by the body to serve the body. So if he thinks, ""No, I'll not serve you because I am different,"" that is ignorance. That is ignorance. That is going on. These Māyāvādīs, they refuse to serve God. That is ignorance. If they are part and parcel of God or one with God, how you can refuse to serve? That is ignorant. Here the finger is my part and parcel of the body. It cannot refuse to serve. I say; immediately it comes. So if the finger thinks that ""I am one. Why shall I serve the whole body?"" that is ignorance. Cetana . Cetana means activity. So if I am one with God, then my activities should be simultaneously with God. That is oneness. I don't disagree. God says, ""You do it."" I disagree. God says, ""You surrender unto Me,"" but I refuse. That is ignorance. If I am actually one with God, just I am asking, ""You do this""—you do immediately. But if you do not do it, that is ignorance. Gurur avajñā . Then he becomes aparādhī . Similarly, oneness means no disagreement. That is oneness, cetana . Cetana means I can disagree or agree. Two things are there. That is cetana . So cetana , cetanaś cetanānaṁ. So when God says that ""You do it,"" you must do it. That is agreement. That is oneness. If you refuse, that is ignorance. How can you refuse? Suppose you.... Take the whole family, and the head of the families asks somebody to do something. If he refuses, then that is rebellious condition. In the state the citizen must agree with the government. Cetana . Cetana means he has got both the things. If he likes, he can agree; if he likes, he does not agree."
Vasughoṣa,So their big word is that you merge and you become that. So how...,Prabhupāda," That is merging. They do not know what is merging. Merging means ""I, so long I was disagreeing; now I agree to abide by Your..."" That is merging. Just like several states they merge into one. So they agree to work unitedly. That is merging. Merging does not mean that you have got your discretion and that is finished. That is not merging. Then your cetana is lost. How it can be lost?"
Mahāmṣa,What about the analogy that many rivers flow into the same sea and lose their individuality?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Mahāmṣa,"Their example is that many rivers, they flow into one sea, and then they lose their individuality.",Prabhupāda," Because they are short-sighted, blind, that there are many individual living entities within the river. But they are blind. They cannot see them. Because it is covered by water they see only the water is there. Because they are blind rascals, they cannot see. But if they go deep into the water they will see there are so many individuals, millions, and they are living in the same river."
Harikeśa,Harikeśa : But there's no difference between the individual living entity and the total...,Prabhupāda," Yes, there is no difference. Still, that is.... That is acintya - bheda ... That is individuality and no individuality. So long they are living there within the river, there is no individuality."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : That example is also a jugglery of words because the.... Let's say the Mississippi River is the quantity of water that's on the land. When it goes into the ocean you don't say that ""Now the Mississippi River is in the ocean."" Mississippi River is still individual, and the ocean is another thing.",Prabhupāda, The Mississippi is not finished.
Mahāmṣa,And the water molecules...,Prabhupāda," And not only that, the water is again taken away and it is thrown into the Mississippi. So these rascals who think that ""We have now merged. We are now liberated,"" that is rascaldom. They will be taken away and thrown again. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa ... No, this is fact. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB 10.2.32 ] . They cannot stay. They will be taken away by the nature's law, converted into cloud and thrown away, again come, again come. They are thrown away. They cannot stay. And again they become water and come through. That is going on, coming and going. So their merging is not fact."
Yaśodānandana,Vimukta - māninaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Yes, vimukta - māninaḥ , yes."
Mahāmṣa,"[break] ... oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam . That claims Viṣṇu as the Supreme, but where does it say that Viṣṇu ..., I mean Kṛṣṇa , is the source of Viṣṇu from the śrutis ?",Prabhupāda," Śruti... Brahmā said, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bs. 5.1] ."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Brahma - saṁhitā is śruti .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Brahmā spoke śruti , Vedas, so whatever he speaks is śruti . It is therefore called saṁhitā . Saṁhitā means Vedas, śruti . As soon as it is called saṁhitā , that is Vedas."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : [break] ...comprises the examination for bhaktivedanta and bhakti -śāstrī ?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : There was talk that they would be given examinations.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : What is the syllabus for...?,Prabhupāda," Whatever books we have got, it should be studied. Bhakti -śāstrī means Nectar of Devotion, Bhagavad- gītā , Nectar of Instruction, Beyond Death —in this way we select some ten books. That is bhakti -śāstrī."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : So when will that...,Prabhupāda," Then we come to Bhāgavata , then we come to Caitanya - caritāmṛta , in this way. So from next year, unless one passes bhakti -śāstrī, he cannot be second initiated. First initiation is open for everyone. ""Come on. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" That will purify him. Then let him understand what is bhakti ."
Yaśodānandana,"This is very good, because then those that will become second..., those that will have second initiation will have to know the scriptures, will have to know your books.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is.... Now there is..."
Mahāmṣa,"And unless they know your books, they will never be fixed-up devotees.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Many times people give second initiation because they need a pūjārī in the temple.,Prabhupāda, No.
Acyutānanda; Mahāmṣa; Acyutānanda; Mahāmṣa,"Acyutānanda : So they give.; [break] ...different Purāṇas have different Gītās, Prabhupāda? So some person said that there is a Gaṇeśa - gītā .

And they also say...; Acyutānanda : Universal form.; They show the universal form or they say that they are paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma [Bg. 10.12 ] . They say the same things in their gitas.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. Let them do that. We take Bhagavad- gītā . That's all. Śaṅkarācārya also— bhagavad- gītā kiñcid adhītā . If Bhagavad- gītā is understood a little only, he becomes liberated."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Then why should it be called the Bhagavad- gītā and not the Kṛṣṇa - gītā . Kṛṣṇa is referred to as Bhagavān .,Prabhupāda," Huh ? Bhagavad- gītā , not Bhāgavata - gita ."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : No, Bhagavata , because He is.... The others are not Bhagavata .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB 1.3.28 ] . Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam . Bhagavān , that I explained so many times. Bhagavān everyone, little possessing opulence."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : But these other Gītās are named after the demigod.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. He can be called bhagavān . He is not ordinary man. He can be called. But the real Bhaga .... Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam . That is the.... The real Bhagavān is here, but these demigods, they have got little opulences, not equal to Kṛṣṇa . Therefore they are sometimes called Bhagavān ."

Mahāmṣa,These demigods?,Prabhupāda, Yes. What is that universal form? It is nothing. Any powerful living being can do that.
Yaśodānandana,"In the other Vaiṣṇava -sampradāyas, such as the Madhva - sampradāya and the Rāmānuja- sampradāya , they do not understand that Kṛṣṇa has His own planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana . They think that there is only Vaikuṇṭha and nothing else.",Prabhupāda," Their knowledge is imperfect. In the Brahma - saṁhitā it is said, goloka - nāmni nija - dhāmni tale ca tasya [Bs. 5.43] ."
Yaśodānandana; Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"That is why when Caitanya Mahāprabhu came back to Purī , He said, ""I have met many Rāmānujas, many Mādhvas, many Buddhists, but I like Rāmānanda Rāya very much because he has this knowledge of Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa .""; Acyutānanda : In South India there are very few Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa devotees.

Indian man,"""There are so many things. Doing any social activities?""",Prabhupāda," These things are being done by so many other people, and we are doing something which is ultimate. The hospital gives some medicine when there is some disease, but that does not mean there will be no disease. Can they guarantee that ""I give you this medicine—no more disease."" We are giving that medicine, that no more disease. That is the best social work. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. 4.9 ] . We are giving this medicine, that after leaving this body.... So far this body is concerned, somehow or other you pass on. And as soon as you give up this body— tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. 4.9 ]—you'll have no more birth.

Indian man,Because they want...,Prabhupāda," ""They"" not. What I am talking with you. They are all foolish. We call them mūḍhas, duṣkṛtino mūḍhas. So their demand is not legitimate. If a mūḍha ... If your small child says, ""Father, give me a bidi, cigarette,"" would you give him? Because he is mūḍha .

Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Even socially, though, without religious, scientific, practical God consciousness, how can there be a civilization? How can anyone know that there's a difference between right and wrong or morality unless there is God consciousness, to know that someone is watching everything I do? If you avoid that.... Just like we say, they want Rāma - rājya without Rāma . But they want the rājya .",Prabhupāda," Now, the laws and legislative assembly there are, and there is punishment, there is court—everything there is.

What is your answer? Why you are checked on the airport just like a culprit, criminal? They cannot trust even a gentleman, although he is educated, may be holding very good office, but still, he is not to be trusted. So this is the result of your so-called function, that there is no honest man throughout the whole world. Then, what is the use of such education? And what is the use of their living? Let them die. No hospital for them."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : A man in Calcutta, he was a devotee, rich also. He had some kidney thing. He wanted to go to the Calcutta hospital. They said, ""All the beds are full of Naxalites with bomb wounds and stab wounds and fighting wounds.""",Prabhupāda, Just see.

You have mentioned that in the introduction to your Nectar of Devotion.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. What is the use of such education?
Indian man,"So your education which you gave may be something like..., not like that.",Prabhupāda," Education means to do the right thing, not the wrong thing. That is education. Education means enlightenment, to know what is right, what is wrong. That is education."

One must know how to run the car which side. Education means enlightenment. If you foolishly do something, immediately you become criminal. So education means to enlighten them to know what is right, what is wrong. That is education. But people do not know that. What is the meaning of education? [break]"
Mahāmṣa; Vasughosa,"Actually, in all the schools the young people are learning all the bad habits from the schools.

Indian man,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, What is meditation?
Indian man (2),Giving all thoughts.... Coming to pure silence of the mind.,Prabhupāda, So how you can be silent? Is it possible?
Indian man (2),"No, just by some sādhana .",Prabhupāda, Silent is also.... (dog barking) The stones are silent. Does it mean meditation?
Indian man (2); Harikeśa,But mind cannot be silent. The mind must be made to (indistinct).; Harikeśa : Hut!,Prabhupāda, So then how you can make silent?
Indian man (2); Prabhupāda: Medita; Indian man (2),By seeing God in everything.; tion is not silence. That is wrong idea. Meditation means to think of God. That is meditation.; Brahma - bhāvana .,Prabhupāda," Brahma - bhāvana is also not practical. Parabrahma- bhāvana , kṛṣṇa - bhāvana . That is Kṛṣṇa conscious."
Indian man (2),Supreme Lord.,Prabhupāda," That is real meditation. Meditation does not mean to make the mind vacant. No, a wrong. People are thinking like that. It cannot be. One girl—that is written—""Sir, meditation to make the mind out of all thoughts."" So she said, she thought that ""How can I be without thoughts? This 'without thought,' I'll think—that is a thought. Therefore it is bogus."" He (she) threw away this meditation book."
Indian man (2),"No, thinking about the God's thought, in course of time it will be empty. Mind will be empty.",Prabhupāda," So unless you come.... According to your idea, unless you come to that emptiness, you are not perfect. But that will never come."
Indian man (2),Then only it will be empty.,Prabhupāda, That will never come. Therefore it is bogus. You cannot...
Indian man (2),"In the beginning it is bogus, but the result is...",Prabhupāda," No, no. In the beginning bogus and it is always bogus, because mind cannot be without thought. So why do you propose ""without thought""? That is not possible. Therefore it is bogus."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What is the beauty of having emptiness?,Prabhupāda, That is another.... Emptiness mean he is troubled by so many anxieties; therefore he wants to make it empty.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's simply negative.,Prabhupāda, Negative idea. That is material idea. That is not spiritual.
Mahāmṣa,"Nowadays people are going in silence, but they write questions and answers by paper. They say, ""I am observing silence...""",Prabhupāda, As if there is no sound.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In Allahabad we met a man like that. He was moving around so much that he was more active than if he had talked.,Prabhupāda," No, that ""ooohh."" That is the..."
GopālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : Even Basarilal Nanda , I have heard, one day a week, on Sunday, it's his silence day.

What is the utility?

Mahāmṣa,It is good for them.,Prabhupāda," Because they cannot speak anything good, better remain silent. [break] ...chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa , yan - nāma śruti - mātrena pumān bhavati nirmalaḥ . Simply by hearing he'll become purified. So why we shall become silent? Let them hear."

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Constantly chanting.,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa says, satataṁ kīrtayanto mām . Why.... Never said that ""You become silent."" Where is?

Harikeśa; Yaśodā-nandana,Harikeśa : He takes it from there and puts it on the plate before you eat?; Yaśodā - nandana : He keeps the salt in a separate bowl. When you require it he will give you only as much as you require.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is nice."
Hariśauri,"That's why the bowl is there. That's what I intended to do, but I have to keep it away from the table.",Prabhupāda," The principle should be that you should not leave remnants of food. As soon as it is used, it should not be used more. Otherwise it is not possible to give up. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [ Bg . 9.59] . I am eating something not very superior, but if I get the chance of eating something superior, then I give up this inferior. So there is no question of making it vacant or void. To fill up the place with better thing.... So when you think of Kṛṣṇa , then you forget māyā . Otherwise you are entrapped with māyā . Why Kṛṣṇa says, man- manā bhava mad -bhakto ? Mām eva ye prapadyante . This is wanted. As soon as you become anyābhilāṣī, then it becomes difficult. Where is that knife? Give me one amroot (?). Cut into pieces and get..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I think these are from the local..., growing here.",Prabhupāda," That we should be very careful, that we should think of Kṛṣṇa only, not of māyā , in everything. No more strength. Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām [Bg. 9.14 ] . Avismṛti- kṛṣṇa -padāravindayoḥ kṣinoty abhadrāṇi . We are in the abhadra , māyā . But avismṛti- kṛṣṇa -padaravindayoḥ kṣiṇoti . The thinking of māyā will gradually finish. Avismṛiti- kṛṣṇa -padaravindayoḥ kṣiṇoti ... No, no, I said that you give these pieces, little, little. I'll do it myself. These pieces, this amroot (?), yes."
Hariśauri,This. I'll give it out.,Prabhupāda, So no vismṛti. Avismṛti. Vismṛti is ignorance. Avismṛti.
Mahāṁsa,"They say there are many old temples which need renovation, so they will spend the money for the renovation of old temples but not construct new temples.",Prabhupāda, That means they don't want expansion.
Mahāṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So what kind of committee?
Mahāṁsa; GopālaKṛṣṇa; Mahāṁsa,"But that also is a farce, because they spent thirteen lakhs of rupees for construction of a temple in New York.; Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : New York.; Yes.",Prabhupāda," So New York, we have got so many temples. Let them here."

Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : They bring in preachers to preach Bhagavad- gītā , but they themselves, they don't read Bhagavad- gītā .",Prabhupāda," So preachers means third-class preachers. Anybody is allowed to speak, any nonsense? That is going on?"

Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Then they will say, ""Well, you are proselytizing by rice.""",Prabhupāda, I am not proselytizing. I am bringing him...
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Unless they take to your religion...,Prabhupāda, ...to his original consciousness.
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Unless they follow you, then you won't feed them. You are starving them until they...",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. We shall go on. Chanting will also go on. Both things."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : That was the article of the CARE, I think. They will give food, but you cannot use it to proselytize.",Prabhupāda," No, we give kṛṣṇa - prasādam , not food."
Acyutānanda; Harikeśa; Acyutānanda; Harikeśa; Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Like in Guntur, in a Christian hospital, in the maternity ward they would not release the baby to the parents until they converted to Christianity.; Harikeśa : Where?; Acyutānanda : In Guntur. So they did it to one brāhmaṇa family, and he brought it to the court because he was more orthodox, and they were.... Only one or two articles came in the newspaper. It was hushed up.; Harikeśa : It takes ten years for the court to decide.; Acyutānanda : Well, immediately the police ordered that it had to be released. Or they put.... Just like the Mohammedan water, they put some bread in a well in a place like this, and then they can say, ""You are all Christian now because you have drunk the bread that we have put there.""",Prabhupāda, They are doing like that here?
Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Yes. In Europe, when Christianity first came to Constantine, the priests would stay in the top of a river, and they marched an army through the river, and the priest put the holy water, and when the army came on the other side they said, ""Now you've all been baptized. You're all Christians."" Mass conversion. [break] ... Hindu groups are mixing Hinduism and Indian nationality, it's fascism. That was also the government's...; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Huh ?; Acyutānanda : Fascism.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Who?; Acyutānanda : The Hindu groups. That was the point that enraged the government. The same paṇḍitas with the prāyaścitta , they don't like the Mohammedans, they don't like the Christians. They say, ""You have created Pakistan, so all the Mohammedans should go there. This is Hindustan.""",Prabhupāda, Murvi(?) meat here?
Indian man (1),Not everyone did.,Prabhupāda, Mostly.
Indian man (1),Mostly. Nowadays it is a fashion to eat when the brāhmaṇas take in a house.,Prabhupāda, Taking?
Indian man (1); TamālaKṛṣṇa; Indian man (1),"Yes, they take it.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The brāhmaṇas ?; Yes, most of them. [break]",Prabhupāda, ... sambhava . Where is brāhmaṇa ? All śūdra .
Indian man (1),But according to.... [break],Prabhupāda," ...not vegetarian. We are neither nonvegetarian. We eat kṛṣṇa - prasādam . Kṛṣṇa says, ""Give me this food."" Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ [ Bg. 9.26 ] . So we offer Him, and then we eat it, so we have nothing to do with vegetarian and nonvegetarian. If Kṛṣṇa says that, ""You give Me flesh,"" then we can eat flesh also. But Kṛṣṇa does not say that."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Śrīla Prabhupāda? I have heard one person say that patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ doesn't include other things. There are many other things that we offer Kṛṣṇa besides patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So similarly, why can't we offer meat? He doesn't say, ""Don't offer me meat.""",Prabhupāda, Hm. Hm?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : In the Bhagavad- gītā it doesn't say you can't offer Kṛṣṇa meat.,Prabhupāda," So if you like, you can do that."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I don't want to.,Prabhupāda," (chuckles) What directly He says, you have to take. And if you interpret, that can be interpreted."
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : They have rewritten the Bible, ""Thou shalt not murder.""",Prabhupāda, [break] ...can be used as paper weight. (laughter) [break] ...use anything for Kṛṣṇa .
Yaśodānandana,...temples they are worshiping this Dvārakā - śilā with the śalagrāma - śilā .,Prabhupāda," That's all right, but we have no such instruction. (end)"
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Also, in their evidences by which they base their dialectic discussions, have they regarded the Vedic scriptures? They have avoided them very conveniently.",Prabhupāda," No, there is no question of dialectic discussion. Suppose I am discussing, you are discussing something, but if I am imperfect, you are imperfect, what is the value of such discussion? That is the point. The party discussing something, whether he is perfect? If he is not perfect, then go on discussing. We first of all say that any conditioned soul is defective, and that is admitted. They say, ""We are not perfect."" ""I think,"" they say. ""In my opinion,"" they say. Never they say, the so-called scientists, ""definite."" And they cannot say it."
Mahamsa,That is like Dr. Frog's philosophy when they speculate.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Simply speculation. So that kind of discussion, what is the value?"
GopālaKṛṣṇa,Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : It's always a hypothesis.,Prabhupāda," If some children discuss some serious subject matter, what is the value? And they are all children in the cradle of nature, that's all. Prakṛteḥ kriya .... Therefore it is word, prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. 3.27 ] . Just like children—""Ha! Sit down here""—he has to sit down. Then where is his freedom to discuss? Prakṛti says that ""You sit down here. Don't go there."" He has to accept. Then what is the value of discussion?"
Acyutānanda,"Acyutānanda : Mainly, these Karl Marx, they were angry at the Christian church for exploiting the poor masses, and that's the reason...",Prabhupāda, This is our...
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : ...so he has attacked. He has taken vengeance on this.,Prabhupāda," That they are doing. Still they are doing. Just like you said, some sprinkling water. They have no philosophy and they violate everything, what is stated there in Bible. Now you say that ""Thou shall not kill;"" they say, ""Thou shall not murder."" They are molding. Now this homosex they are sanctioning, man-to-man marriage. They are sanctioning abortion."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : Yes. Two homosexuals were married by a priest.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Now they have a church where the priests are homosexuals and the attending people are homosexual.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Now they have churches for homosex. That means the priest is a homosexual, and the persons who come are homosexuals. A special church for homosexuals.",Prabhupāda, Just see. Is that religion?
Yaśodānandana,"The simple fact that the Christians have to sprinkle water to convert means that they do not have any potency to by philosophy, to preach to them with strong philosophy.",Prabhupāda," There is no.... So, go on reading."
Harikesa; Acyutānanda; Yaśodānandana; Acyutānanda; Gurukeśa,"Harikesa : I'll backspace two sentences.; Acyutānanda : [break] ""...have allowed us to wither away these different countries, and the religionists, they are keeping all the food.

They may counteract by saying, ""We also produce...""; Acyutānanda : They had to purchase wheat from America.; Russia is importing its food grains now.",Prabhupāda," So why they cannot produce sufficient, such a big country?"
Gurukeśa,"And Eastern Europe, which is also communist, gets all its supplies from...",Prabhupāda," No, what is their explanation. Russia is the biggest country."
Gurukeśa; Hari-śauri,Land.; Hari - śauri : The reason was that there was no rain.,Prabhupāda," Then? Then you have to depend on rain, and when we say, parjanyād anna - sambhavaḥ ... Hm? And yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. 3.14 ] . That means, rascal, you take one side, that ardha -kukuti- nyāya . Cut the chicken half, and separate the mouth—it is expensive—and keep the rear side. You get eggs. (laughter) So this is ardha -kukuṭi- nyāya . The rascal does not know that if you separate the mouth there will be no egg."
Gurukeśa; Acyutānanda,They say that's depending upon nature. But they do not know who...; Acyutānanda : The word nature should be condemned. That.... No scientific-minded person can say the word nature.,Prabhupāda," No, they do not know what is nature. Nature is an instrument, and there must be an operator. So that they do not know, the operator. Just like a child is thinking the motorcar is going automatically. He does not know there is a driver. The child sees that the airplane is flying. They think it is automatically going. And there is a pilot, he does not know. Similarly, these rascals, they are studying nature, but nature is an instrument only. It is being operated by Kṛṣṇa . Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram [Bg. 9.10 ]. They have practical experience that without operator a machine cannot work. In the huge machine, how it is working unless there is operator? That they do not know."
Gurukeśa,That's what they never trying to find.,Prabhupāda," Mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam . Find out this verse. Mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam . Mūḍha . Therefore they are all mūḍhas. So we are not going to be misled by the mūḍhas. That is not possible. We take the instruction of the topmost intelligent person, Kṛṣṇa . I think our Svarūpa Dāmodara has said that. Where is that book? He has given: ""Kṛṣṇa, the topmost scientist."" Yes. ""Perceiving the supreme scientist, Śrī Kṛṣṇa ."" He has given this article."
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : How do we know that Vedavyāsa is not defective like other living beings?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Acyutānanda,Acyutānanda : How do we know that Vedavyasa is not...,Prabhupāda," He is not defective because he is speaking what he has heard from Nārada . Therefore he is not defective. Just like we are speaking. We are not perfect. We are also ordinary human being, but people are taking that ""Bhaktivedanta Swami has done wonder."" What is that wonder? I am speaking Bhagavad- gītā as it is, that's all."
