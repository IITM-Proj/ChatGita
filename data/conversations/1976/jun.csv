Rāmeśvara; Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Reporter,"Rāmeśvara : Do you want to sit on chairs or...?; No, this is fine.; Rāmeśvara : Oh, good. Indian style. How large is the newspaper? The circulation?; 450,000.; Rāmeśvara : Half a million.; Ah, Swami. What is your purpose here with your ah.... with the faith in seeking the growth and so on.",Prabhupāda, (to Rāmeśvara ) That is the purpose you can explain.
Rāmeśvara; Reporter,"Rāmeśvara : The purpose of our, of our seeking the growth is so that people all over the world can become happy again. People who are suffering due to lack of knowledge about who they are and what their relationship is with God, and as a result of that ignorance, they're performing so many activities which cause them pain and misery, so that they can become happy again.; Ah. How is..., how will this be achieved?",Prabhupāda," Misery. Misery is caused due to ignorance. They admit or not. The more we are kept in darkness of knowledge, we suffer. What is the difference between ah..., what is called? Developed nations and not developed nations. This America belonged to the Red Indians. And because they are not developed, their condition was developed, ah, different from the present America. They could not construct such big, big house, and big, big roads, and like that because they are in ignorance. That is the difference. Prosperity, no prosperity. Happiness, not happiness. They are ignorance and knowledge."
Reporter,They have.... Is it that they have confused materialism with happiness?,Prabhupāda," Not Material, I mean, I mean to say. Happiness is knowledge."
Reporter,Hmm.,Prabhupāda," Happiness is knowledge. Man who is in ignorance, he is suffering, and that you say material and spiritually. A person who is not in developed consciousness, he is suffering. And they commit sinful acts also."
Reporter,I beg your pardon?,Prabhupāda," They commit sinful acts also in ignorance. That is the difference between man and animal. Animal means not developed consciousness. They.... Some of them, they say the animal has no soul. That is foolishness. Animal has soul, but the consciousness is not developed. Just like a child. Father's consciousness and the child's consciousness different. Why it is different? The child's consciousness is not developed. Father's consciousness is developed. Because the child is talking some nonsense, you cannot say there is no soul. There is soul, but the consciousness is not developed."
Reporter,Do you see hope for mankind in the future?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Man can be happy immediately provided the consciousness is developed.
Reporter,Can.... Do you think that this will ever be achieved?,Prabhupāda," Yes. It can be achieved. Just like I have sent a letter to your government asking them questions that you write on the bills: ""In God We Trust."" So is it that you trust in God blindly or knowingly? That was my question. Suppose I trust you. So you must be trustworthy. Otherwise why shall I trust you? So this question I asked the government: ""You write on the bills, 'In God We Trust,' so what kind of trust is this?"" If you actually trust, then you must know that God is trustworthy. Only blindly trust as a slogan. But that letter is not in reply. So what is your opinion? ""In God We Trust,"" but how do you trust, why you trust? This is my question."
Reporter,"It would be a matter of faith, I suppose.",Prabhupāda," Faith may be different. You may have faith, I may not have faith. That is not the question. Just like in the bank you deposit some money. If some may have faith or no faith, but that bank is trustworthy. You know that your money deposited in the bank will not be cheated. Similarly if you trust in God, you must know whether God is trustworthy. Whether.... What do you mean by God? This is not the question of faith. Faith is bad. It is a question of understanding. So that we want, that America-specially you are favorite amongst all other nations; you are well-to-do, richer than other nations—so why don't you take God seriously? Why should you trust in God as faith? No, you understand what is God and have your faith at full, that ""God is, yes, trustworthy,"" so that others may also know that God is trustworthy. That is our mission, that why God entrust? Are we trusting God? Should we.... A slogan. Let it be a fact by scientific study, by scientific understanding. There is way to understand why God is trustworthy. It's not the question of faith. It is a fact."
Devotee,Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Just like a child had..., has faith in his parents. So that is not an artificial thing, that is fact. And parents are trustworthy to the child. There is no doubt of..., by nature. So, similarly, why could..., you should be in trust in God? Why blindly? Why not trust with knowledge? And that is our movement. Every civilized person has got some faith in God. But now, they're advanced, they should understand what is God, why you must have faith in Him. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
Reporter,It's a matter of education...,Prabhupāda," Simply faith, blind faith we do not endure. And therefore they are becoming godless. And gradually, if we do not understand factually what is God, then the whole human civilization will be godless. To become godless means again animal. That is the difference between animal and man. In the animal society there is no question of religion, faith, God. These things are not there. The human civilization, if it becomes like that, without any faith in God, without any understanding of God, then where is the difference between cats and dogs and human beings? They must know God scientifically. That is the actual aim of human life. Suppose the dog is sleeping on the street without any care whether a car is coming and smash it. He's also sleeping sound sleep. And we are sleeping in a very nice apartment. So after all, sleeping. And he is also enjoying sleeping, I am also enjoying sleeping. So do you think to change the, I mean to say, circumstances of the sleeping? I am sleeping in a very nice apartment, he's sleeping on the floor. Does it mean this is advancement of civilization? Sleeping is sleeping. Eating is eating. Sex life—the male dog is enjoying with female dog. The sex pleasure is to him, and we are enjoying with a beautiful lover. The sex pleasure is the same. Therefore, you take some eatable, either on gold fork or an iron fork, the taste is the same. Simply like putting the foodstuff in the golden fork, does it mean the taste has changed? So, the test of eating, sleeping, mating and defending is the same for the human being as well as the animals. What difference, what is the difference between the animals and humans? The animal cannot know God. That is not possible. The human being can know. That is the opportunity of this human life. If we are missing that opportunity, then we are leading an animal civilization. This is not civilization. Animal life is not civilization. Civilized means not animal life. Something more than that. That is God consciousness."
Reporter,Do you have programs developed to educate mankind towards this God consciousness?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Concrete education. Not fictitious. Concrete.
Reporter,"How will you.... How would you get man to become aware of the situation so he could desire, even desire unconsciously?",Prabhupāda," There is a very simply fact. It you simply understand that one verse in the Bhagavad- gītā , there it is stated that"
Reporter,Mmm!,Prabhupāda," So, we are coming from material nature. That means we are..., material nature is our mother. From the womb of mother, the child comes from. So, from the material nature everything is coming. Therefore according to Vedic knowledge, this earth is also mother. We have got seven mothers according to Vedic civilization:"
Reporter,Mm?,Prabhupāda, Is it possible?
Reporter,I wouldn't think so.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Reporter,I wouldn't think so. No.,Prabhupāda," So, there must be father. This is conclusion. So who is sanctioning about the father? The answer is in the Bhagavad- gītā : ahaṁ bīja - pradaḥ pitā [ Bg . 14.4 ] , ""I am father."" You cannot denying father; that is not possible. If there is mother, if there is child, there must be father. This is human sense. And animal sense is: ""I don't care for father. There may be father, may not be..."" That is animal sense. So do you want to keep the human society in such ignorance just like cats and dogs? The dogs do not care who is father. This movement wants to give education to the human society: ""Yes, there is father."" And that is actual fact. Without father how there is child? Is it possible? Then? For at the present moment, the human society is child playing on the lap of mother, that's all. In big, big motorcars, that's all. Without any knowledge of father. But will the human being remain simply satisfied with toys on the lap of mother, or you'll try to understand who is father? So we are satisfied with the toys, and playing on the lap of the mother. The motorcar is running very swiftly, head-break or neck-break speed, and they are thinking they are civilized, advanced. What is.... ""Who is your father?"" ""Don't know."""
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Then, where do you live?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Where do you.... Where do...?,Prabhupāda," But, he lives on the lap of mother, that's all."
Ambarīṣa,"Ambarīṣa : I just came from Vancouver from the Habitat Conference. The U.N. is having a Habitat Conference in Vancouver, and they (indistinct) is not united, their discussions and arguments. Sometimes there are walkouts, so many things, and they're not able to reach any conclusions, they can't agree with each other.",Prabhupāda," How they can? Do you mean to say dogs simply barking, they will come to a conclusion? (chuckles) It is not possible. There is no aim, what is the actual aim of life. So this is very important movement. At least the intelligent class of men, they must understand it thoroughly. Just like there is body. There are different parts, different sections of the body, but the most important section is the brain. Similarly, the important section of society means one who is fully in God consciousness. I.... You can cut my hands, I shall live. You can cut my legs, I shall live. But if you cut my head, (indistinct). So, at the present moment, there are big, big scientists, big, big technologists. That's all right; that is hands and legs. But there is no brain. Therefore in one sense, you can take it as dead society. So in my opinion, I like your country, America. Sometimes I call, ""This is my fatherland,"" because these American boys, they are helping me pushing on this movement. I am very much obliged to these boys. Now, let us take it little more seriously statewise. And if America takes it seriously, other nations will follow. And there is the United Nations Organization in America. And make a nice organization to understand God. United Nations God Consciousness. People will benefit."
Reporter,Do you see America getting more God consciousness?,Prabhupāda, At least I see majority of my disciples are Americans. Why not expanding?
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Prabhupāda, before Richard asked me a question: what is the difference between our movement and say another religion like the Sikhs or some other religion?",Prabhupāda," Don't misunderstand. It is.... Religion, it means a kind of faith. Just like you are Christian, I am Hindu . So you have faith in Christian religion, I have faith in Hin.... That is another thing. But this is.... We understand religion in a different way according to English dictionary. But real religion means the law given by God. This is the shortcut definition of religion. And if you do not know what is God, and if you do not know what is His law, then what is the meaning of religion? There is no meaning of religion. If blindly, if I have some faith in some dogmas and ritualistic ceremonies, that is not religion. Religion means the science by which you can understand God and the law of God. That is religion. It is not the kind of faith. Just like state laws. You may have faith or no faith. The state law is law; you have to obey it. Just like I have come in America. In our country, the street law is ""Keep to the left."" So I have come to America, you say ""Keep to the right."" If I say, ""No, I have no faith in this 'Keep to the right.' "" No, I must obey. That is law. Similarly, religion means you may have faith or no faith, but you must obey. It is a must. It is not optional. That is religion. That, I explained it many times that (indistinct) means characteristic. Just like everyone of us, we are servant. So, the living entity is servant. He may have faith or no faith, he must be a servant. And if you don't become servant of God, then you become servant of dog. That is your advancement of civilization. When there is no service for God, just like here we have got service for God, there is no question of serving dog. But when we forget service of God, then automatically we become service of dog. But service.... I am servant, that's a fact. And voluntarily keep a dog and serve him. They have no master, then I keep a master, dog, cat. You call it by the name, pet. What is a pet? I do service, that's all. So this is our advancement of civilization. We have refused to serve God, and you voluntarily accept to serve dog. Now in India, they are also learning. (chuckles) And formerly, dog keeping, dog there was in the neighborhood. But they were not allowed to enter the room or house. Now, they are keeping dogs just like the Western people keep. They are making dog show and so on, so on."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Dog show.,Prabhupāda, They are learning how serve the dog. And they are giving up God.
Ambarīṣa,"Ambarīṣa : Yeah, there are a lot of people here that worship their pets.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambarīṣa; Rāmeśvara,Ambarīṣa : Yes.; Rāmeśvara : The Russians served Lenin.,Prabhupāda, They are imitating. You understand people are very expert in this subject matter. They have come.... Learning everything.
Devotee (1),We can't avoid serving.,Prabhupāda," No, that is not possible."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : That's all there is in life, is service.",Prabhupāda," Now we are sitting, so many gentlemen. He's having some paper, and you are serving God. The service is there. Nobody can say, ""No, I don't serve anyone."" Is there any man? No. That is not possible. You must serve. Constitutionally, you are meant for service, either you are president of the state or is anything. That is your position. That is the beginning of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, jīvera svarūpa haya nitya - kṛṣṇa - dāsa [Cc. Madhya 20.108 -109] . All living entities are eternal servant of God."
Ambarīṣa,Ambarīṣa : And all service is the same?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Ambarīṣa; Devotee (1),"Ambarīṣa : All service is the same?; No. He says, ""All service is the same.""",Prabhupāda, How can it be? All service is the same? Do you think...
Ambarīṣa,"Ambarīṣa : Everybody serves in their own way, but it's all...",Prabhupāda," That is.... Unless you come to the service of God, it is wrong."
Devotee (2),"I think he's asking, ""But if it is service to God, then in God's eyes, all service to Him.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,Right.,Prabhupāda," Yes. God, service to God means, just like you put foodstuff in the stomach. Then the service, supplying energy, is distributed automatically. The eyes get service, the ears get service, the hands get service, legs get service, everything. But if you put foodstuff in the eyes, instead of giving service, you make it blind. If you put foodstuff in the ear, instead of hearing, it is blocked. Then that is ignorance. You do not know where to give service. The knowledge, God consciousness, means to know where to give service, so that the service will be automatically distributed. You pour water on the root of the tree and the energy will be distributed to the trunk, to the branches, to the twigs, to the leaves, to the flowers, everyone. We are missing their point. This is scientific,"
Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Devotee (1),"I have no more questions.; Rāmeśvara : No questions about this assignment.; You asked earlier about our program for educating society, are you still interested in this?",Prabhupāda, This education is all explained.
Devotee (2),I think he was interested also techniques by which we go about educating society. We have some techniques which...,Prabhupāda, Technical knowledge is not education.
Devotee (2),"No, but I mean, as far as our books are.... We have our techniques for educating society.",Prabhupāda, Oh!
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Our program is to distribute the books of the Vedas with our spiritual master's philosophical commentaries. We already discussed a little bit before we came.,Prabhupāda," And all this subject matter, everything, sixty-two books already."
Rāmeśvara; Devotee (2),"Rāmeśvara : Thank you very much, Śrīla Prabhupāda.; Jaya !",Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . (end)
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : While I was in New York, I've been going to the United Nations building there, and there's a organization called ECOSOC, the Economic and Social Council. It's made up of the members of the U.N. and I think there's very good chance that our society can be represented amongst this group as a nongovernmental organization, which means that in various matters which the council discusses, we would be a consultive group and we would be able to present statements as well as literature on how to solve..., on our viewpoint on how to solve various problems facing the council. And these would be distributed to all the United Nations representatives.",Prabhupāda," As soon as you say ""God,"" they will reject."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, actually, one of the things which this council handles is freedom of religion throughout the world.",Prabhupāda," That means they do not believe in God. Freedom of religion means whatever you like, you do."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes. That's a fact.,Prabhupāda, That is going on. Religion is not very important.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No. It's not one of their major considerations.,Prabhupāda," Yes. How to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, that is their consideration. Animal activities."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But one advantage of this is that all of the.... Just like they make a lot of studies of various countries.,Prabhupāda," ""Studies"" means if they do not take the science of God as the most important items. Then they'll say: ""Yes, you have freedom, you can do. I have got my freedom."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yeah. They make a lot of information available on the.... In other words, it'll help our saṅkīrtana movement because they make inquiries into the freedom of an individual, for example, to.... As we want to distribute literature in various countries, they have so much facts and figures on where that would be possible.",Prabhupāda," And the newsreel will say that this saṅkīrtana movement is nuisance, it is disturbance. Then what they'll do?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : There's also some respectability if we become connected with...,Prabhupāda, That is all right.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's prestigious, and it also allows us to have a lot of information available. Just like, as we're finding out, for example, Rāmeśvara Mahārāja is working with our lawyer here, and we find that we have the legal right to distribute in airports. Legally, we have the right. Similarly, there are legal rights for our saṅkīrtana movement in various countries in the world, and through this group we would get access to all information on what the legal position is and other things of this kind.",Prabhupāda," Harer nāma [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] . Yes, that's nice."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : (Maharishi Mahesh) Yogi , he tried to file a trademark on the words ""Transcendental Meditation"" with the United States government. So we protested that actually he cannot claim that he is teaching transcendental meditation, what to speak of prohibiting anyone else from using those words. So they accepted our claim and kicked out his application.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bharadvāja,"Rāmeśvara : They were writing, their lawyers were writing our Society letters that ""You cannot use the words 'Transcendental Meditation.' Maharishi has made up this process and you are stealing from him.""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He's stealing from Kṛṣṇa .; Yesterday you gave an example of a man who was lying asleep in bed, and he is transported somewhere in dream, walking on the beach. What is the full...? Because we're going to try to make an exhibit of it. So what is the full analogy? Is he actually going to another place by his mind, he's actually transported?",Prabhupāda," The soul is going there. The seer is the same in this gross body or in the subtle bodies. I am in the, walking in this gross body, I'm seeing this ocean, and I will leave my gross body in dream, I go to India. So the seer is the same. That is the proof of transmigration. He's dreaming tiger, and he's crying, ""Here is a tiger, tiger, tiger,"" and another man, who is seer of the body, he says, ""Where is tiger?"" So this is the difference. One is seeing through this gross body, another seeing through the subtle body, but the seer is the same. Transmigration of the soul means, when he's seeing through.... That is practical. The child, when he's seeing through the childish body, he's talking nonsense. The same soul, when he's talking as an elderly person, he's talking beautiful (indistinct). The seer is the same, simply the glass is changed. Sometimes blue, sometimes red. [break] Seer is the same, medium is different. That you have.... And dead body means the seer is no longer there. It has entered another body. [break]"
Pradyumna,"Pradyumna : ...when someone is sleeping and dreaming, that the seer has left the gross body?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Bharadvāja,"How does the.... Life symptoms, how are the life symptoms maintained in the body?",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Bharadvāja,The life symptoms are maintained in the body still?,Prabhupāda," No, life symptoms, there is not. The body's fit; therefore, he comes back again. When the body is not fit, he enters another body. Just like your car you leave. We have come here. Now the car is all right; we go. If it is useless, we don't go. We take another."
Bharadvāja; Hṛdayānanda,The body is breathing.; Hṛdayānanda : That is like leaving the motor running.,Prabhupāda," They, unless the seer returns back, the body will lie down. That is death. The seer no more comes back. Then it is dead."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes, sometimes a man dies in his sleep.",Prabhupāda, It is dead.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So sleeping is like temporary death.,Prabhupāda," Yes. All deaths are temporary. When you change bodies, you die for seven months. This death is for few hours, and that is for seven months. That's all."
Bharadvāja,What happens when he dreams of the spiritual master or Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda, That's all right. Dreaming means he's seeing. The seer is the same.
Rādhāvallabha,In Hawaii you were saying that they take rest for six months and wake up a dog.,Prabhupāda," Yes. (laughter) [break] ...a small garden like this, that is called a hanging garden."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, we can walk there in the mornings.",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Bharadvāja,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is considered to be the watering process, and sometimes from chanting, the weeds, from watering, the weeds also grow along with devotional service—the weeds of different desires. I don't understand how it is possible that from chanting that these weeds grow.",Prabhupāda," Chanting is purifying all material desires. It will take, gradually. Ceto- darpaṇa - mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12 ]. If you are chanting without any offense, then your heart will be cleansed of all material contamination. Harer nāma [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] ."
Bharadvāja,So pulling out the weeds means avoiding the offenses in chanting the holy name.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So long we'll have material desires, we'll have to accept a material body and fulfill the desires."
Mahendra,"Mahendra : Sometimes, although a devotee understands that he must take birth again if he does not, if he is not strict, he thinks, ""Oh, it is so difficult to be strict. Maybe I'll just take it easy and remain engaged in devotional service, then I'll take another birth as a devotee and maybe next time I'll finish up my business.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . He gets good opportunity of material enjoyment, and then take birth in good family, aristocratic or brāhmaṇa . Then where he ended in last life, he begins again. There is a verse: paurva - dehikam . Paurva - dehikam means previous birth."
Mahendra,"Mahendra : It seems, though, that in that respect, he's gambling.",Prabhupāda, Gambling?
Mahendra,"Mahendra : Yes, he's gambling, that he's thinking that ""Oh, next life I will come back in a better condition,"" but his next might be different.",Prabhupāda, Why should he desire like that? That means he has not understood what is meant by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. One who understands wants to get out in this lifetime.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : One who understands Kṛṣṇa consciousness should want to finish the business of material life.,Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore he's required to read Bhagavad- gītā thoroughly. It is said clearly, ""This is a place of misery."" Why do you desire to keep yourself in this.... That means you do not understand what is spiritual life."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Still thinking he's this body.,Prabhupāda," Thinking. Thinking, he's under the influence of māyā . māyā is dictating, ""Why you are trying to go away? Come on, here, Santa Monica."" (laughter) And when you become detestful either this Santa Monica or any Monica, ""I am not interested,"" then your spiritual life is..."
Jagannātha-suta; Hṛdayānanda; Jagannātha-suta,"Jagannātha - suta : Śrīla Prabhupāda, when I was in New York recently to check the color printing of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , 7.2, we were presented with two awards which your books had won for color and design, two awards from the Printing Industries of Metropolitan New York. They gave us big wooden plaques with a certificate of excellence, yes, for Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam and for Caitanya - caritāmṛta .; Hṛdayānanda : You should show Prabhupāda, bring him those plaques.; Jagannātha - suta : Yes, we have those plaques hanging up in the Press building now.",Prabhupāda," Hm. Bring it, I shall see."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : [break] ...diminution on this path of devotional service, nehābhikrama-nāśo'sti [Bg. 2.40 ] . So does that mean that once one enters the material world, there's only progress in going back to Godhead, although it may be slow, over many lifetimes?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. One is going slow, one is finishing very rapidly. If one is serious, he can finish very rapidly. If one is not serious, it will take time."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : [break] ...contests and get all sorts of awards and recognition. Because no one has such beautiful books.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that's a fact."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : We have also won awards for Back to Godhead, the cover design.",Prabhupāda, Cover designs?
Mahendra; Rādhāvallabha,"Mahendra : They like the cover, but they're afraid to look inside.; Śrīla Prabhupāda, at the time of death, when the soul leaves the body, at that time the body is destroyed. So at the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, how is the body maintained?",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Rādhāvallabha,"At the time of sleeping, when the soul leaves the body, why is the body not destroyed at that time?",Prabhupāda, Why? Suppose you have left the car; does that mean it is destroyed? You are going again.
Rādhāvallabha,But at the time of death it is destroyed when you leave it.,Prabhupāda," Death is different. When the car is no more usable, that is death. But we are returning to the car because we know that it is usable. And if we know that it is useless, we don't go to that car. That is death."
Yadubara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda. At the time of sleeping, there is a subtle reality that the subtle body enters into?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Reality means as you take this awakening vision as reality, similarly, the dream vision is also real.... Nothing, none of them are reality. They are all temporary."
Yadubara,But that subtle reality is just as real as this gross reality?,Prabhupāda, Yes. They'll not stay. This reality will not stay.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : It's all a dreamlike existence.,Prabhupāda," Yes, simply a long duration dream. Do you think this skyscraper building will stay? Nothing will stay. It may stay for five hundred years or five thousand years. But is it not permanent. Anything you take—the trees, this land, nothing; even this ocean. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. 8.19 ] . It appears again and again disappears, that's all. Everything. The material world means that. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate . Vyaktāvyaktam. Sometimes manifested, sometimes not manifested. This town is manifested, and one big wave of sea, it will be nonmanifested, immediately."
Yadubara,So that subtle reality is existing side by side with this gross reality.,Prabhupāda, Reality is in the spiritual world. This is imitation reality. Real reality is in the spiritual world.
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : We have to go left here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (pause) The material universes are like a produce of Mahā - Viṣṇu .",Prabhupāda," A big dream, that's all. Material existence means a big dream. How long you'll dream? So long you are in this body. And as long as the body is finished, your dream is finished. Your nation, your society, your friends, your money, your bank, everything finished. Is it not a dream? Then dream another—you become cats and dogs or demigods. You dream in a different way. You are now dreaming as American; next life you may dream something else."
Bharadvāja,So every man has his own world that he's living in?,Prabhupāda," Eh? He creates his own world. Nothing is own—temporary—he creates, and Kṛṣṇa gives him the opportunity, ""All right, you enjoy."" Hare nāma , hare nāma ."
Govardhana-dhārī; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Govardhana - dhārī : While doing books we create an atmosphere sometimes, the devotees..., Kṛṣṇa gives us the intelligence to give the spiritual world to these living entities. How can we always stay on that transcendental platform, to make them see this? [break] (in car:); Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : If the soul is the living force, if the soul actually leaves the body, how the body will be..., work.; Rāmeśvara : There's some connection still. When the soul is..., when the body..., when you are dreaming, and the soul leaves the body, but still there must be some connection between the soul...",Prabhupāda," Connection is there, just like you leave your car, you keep the engine going on— gug gug gug gug gug gug —but you are not there. The engine, you keep it started."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Somehow the soul's influence is still there.,Prabhupāda, Yes. You make that engine keeping— gug gug gug gug. If you like you can stop.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : Is it actually Kṛṣṇa who's maintaining the life in the body then? The life of the body is maintained by Kṛṣṇa or by the individual jīva ?,Prabhupāda," No, by Kṛṣṇa . Everything is Kṛṣṇa's property. You are thinking, ""It is mine."" Kṣetra - jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva - kṣetreṣu bhārata . I am the proprietor of this body, but another body is there. He is the proprietor of all the bodies. Kṣetra - jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva - kṣetreṣu bhārata . The landlord, he's the proprietor. You are occupier, that's all."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Oh. So the Lord in the heart is keeping that body for that jīva , so that when he's finished dreaming he comes back to it.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : It's actually the Lord that's keeping it.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : ...the engine going.,Prabhupāda, Maybe driver. Driver is left.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Driver is left.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Like chauffeur.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65 , purport]. Kṛṣṇa has unlimited energies. Yesterday you were explaining in your garden to that priest that Kṛṣṇa , He says, Kṛṣṇa says, ""I am the father of all living entities."" And you were saying, ""Who can challenge this or deny it?"" Now someone can say that there is contradiction, if there is some contradiction in Kṛṣṇa's statement, therefore...",Prabhupāda, Who can deny? Who can contradict this? That is my challenge. The contradiction is not valid. Who can contradict it? That is my challenge.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Well, say in some philosophy...",Prabhupāda," Just like a father, a real father can say, ""I am the father."" Who can challenge? Father is one. Who can? Nobody can say ""No, you are not father, he's father."" No. The real father is father. Father cannot be replaced."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : No.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Suppose real father says, ""I am the father of this boy."" Who will challenge it?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Someone who does not believe my father.,Prabhupāda," That means he's a rascal. But father cannot be changed. He does not know; he challenges, that's all. How the father can be changed? Father is one."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : We say that Kṛṣṇa is all good.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : And then the materialist says, ""If Kṛṣṇa is all good, then how is there any evil?""",Prabhupāda, Evil is you.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But everything comes from Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everything comes from.... Yes. If.... You have created a situation. So for your satisfaction, Kṛṣṇa has given you the chance, but that is evil, what you have created."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But I have this propensity because I am part of Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. When you come under māyā , you have got so many propensities. So as soon as you disobey Kṛṣṇa , the māyā is there. Kṛṣṇa - bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare nikaṭa - stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare ( Prema - vivarta ) , immediately. Just like darkness and light. As soon as you give up light, you come to darkness. There is no second alternative."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Kṛṣṇa is the friend of everyone.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : So why does He allow me to have this independence?,Prabhupāda," No, that is His.... Why not?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Because it is not good for me.,Prabhupāda," Then you are not perfectly Kṛṣṇa's aṁśa . Kṛṣṇa has got independence. You see one son is born, even a father has got a black spot here, sometimes the son has got black spot."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : But if it's not good for me, if I will misuse it, why would Kṛṣṇa give it to me anyway?",Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore the demand is ""You surrender, rascal. You are suffering, you surrender. That is your good..."" Therefore He comes, He loves His sons, ""You rascals, why you are creating plans? You come here. Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . I shall give you all comforts."""
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Kṛṣṇa knows everything in the past, and everything in the future.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : So when Kṛṣṇa .... Kṛṣṇa knows that I will misuse my independence, but still He gives me independence.",Prabhupāda, That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.
Rāmeśvara; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Even though it is bad for me.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You say Kṛṣṇa knows you are going to misuse your independence.; Rāmeśvara : Because He knows everything in the past and everything in the future. So He must.... Kṛṣṇa is all-knowing.,Prabhupāda," This present, future, means, just like a father knows the..., how the child is. Now if the child changes, and touches the fire, Kṛṣṇa knows it will burn. He knew when the child did not touch the fire, his future. And when he touched the fire, Kṛṣṇa knew the result. So He always knows. His position is to know the future. He's always.... Now you are changing, what is the future due to your little independence?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So can you actually say that Kṛṣṇa knows you'll misuse your independence? He knows if you misuse your independence what will happen, but can it be actually said that...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...he knows you will definitely misuse...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...you can use your independence properly, it's up to you.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But then that limits Kṛṣṇa . If you say that Kṛṣṇa did not know when I will misuse my indep.... or if I will...,Prabhupāda," No, no. That means you do not know what is the independence. You can, you can change your position at any time. That is your independence."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But doesn't Kṛṣṇa know if I will do it?,Prabhupāda," Yes, because you are independent. That is the meaning."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Marginal.,Prabhupāda," What will the.... That will depend on.... And the result He knows. Just as a lawyer knows that he has done this, criminal, he'll be punished like this. So His position to know the future is always there. Either in this condition or other condition."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But the lawyer doesn't...,Prabhupāda, Why Kṛṣṇa ? Everyone knows. Suppose you have got this body; next body he's a dog. I can say you'll bark.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Yes.,Prabhupāda, What you'll do? That's all. What to speak of Kṛṣṇa ; I can say.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : That was Satsvarūpa's question, Satsvarūpa Mahārāja's question.",Prabhupāda," No, this is the answer. Kṛṣṇa's position is always the same. He knows past, present and future."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : This is Karandhara's problem, this point of philosophy. He cannot understand it. His argument is that he is having so much trouble due to his sense attraction. And Kṛṣṇa gave him the sense attraction, or Kṛṣṇa gave him senses; now he is having trouble controlling his senses. But he argues that Kṛṣṇa knows everything, so Kṛṣṇa knew that he would have trouble controlling his senses; therefore why did Kṛṣṇa give him senses?",Prabhupāda, That is nonsense.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : He says Kṛṣṇa is playing games.,Prabhupāda," I have given you charge of this BBT, millions of dollars you are dealing, but it is not for your misuse. As soon as you misuse, that is your responsibility."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Yes, but he says but still, you'll know that I'm going to misuse it.",Prabhupāda," No. That Kṛṣṇa knows, when something charge is given. But because you are independent, I know that ""Rāmeśvara is very good boy; let him be in charge."" But you can misuse at any moment, because you have got independence. You can misuse at any moment. At that time your position is different. That is this Karandhara's, he was in this position, but as soon as he misused it, immediately, Kṛṣṇa changed his position."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : He's so foolish, he blames...",Prabhupāda," That is our foolishness, that we cannot understand. That is our foolishness. How you can understand Kṛṣṇa's activities?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : That's the only answer.,Prabhupāda," What Kṛṣṇa is doing.... You are little independent, but He is fully independent. He knows everything. His independence is not under condition; your independence is under condition. If you misuse your independence, you'll suffer."
Rāmeśvara; Hari-śauri; Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : His argument is that ""I should never be allowed to misuse my independence.""; Hari - śauri : There's no question of independence then.; Rāmeśvara : Yes.",Prabhupāda, That is not independence. Independence means you can use properly or improperly.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : He cannot understand that.,Prabhupāda, He wants to become a machine.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Yes, he'd rather be a machine and be in Kṛṣṇa's service.",Prabhupāda," No, no, machine we are, but still there is independence. That means you are not absolutely independently, relatively. The state, you say we are American-independent. But that does not mean you can do whatever you like. As soon as you misuse, you are arrested, punished. Even the president is not independent. As soon as he misused his power, drag him, ""Come out."" What to speak of you."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : That's like an impersonalist. He doesn't want any individual existence.,Prabhupāda," And he does not agree to be guided by the supreme controller. He does not agree that He is supreme controller. ""I am everything."" Therefore they are called mūḍhas, māyayāpahṛta- jñānāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . Mūḍha . He's being controlled. As soon as there is some toothache, he goes to the doctor. And he says ""I am God."" He's becoming old, and he says that ""I am God."" Why you are becoming old? God is always young."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : He has another argument. He says that he's in the grip of māyā .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : So even though he wants to go back to Godhead, he cannot be freed from the influence of māyā . Māyā is keeping him.",Prabhupāda," Unless you are fully surrender, sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] , you cannot do it. Māyā will not leave you."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : But in order to fully surrender, you have to be free from māyā .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Māyā will keep you freed when you fully surrender. If you surrender to your wife and many women, māyā will not give you."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : He's thinking freedom without Kṛṣṇa .; Rāmeśvara : He says that māyā keeps making him full of material desires.,Prabhupāda," Yes, māyā must keep you, must keep you, must keep you because you are not surrendering fully."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Then he says that ""As long as I have all these material urges, I cannot control them. The māyā is insurmountable.""",Prabhupāda," No. Māyā is not.... What māyā is? Punishing, that's all."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : The desire is ours; it's simply either Kṛṣṇa or māyā .,Prabhupāda, Therefore you have to rectify your desires. That is bhakti .
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : By chanting.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : How do you.... But then he says, ""How do you develop the strength to keep chanting even when māyā is making you so attracted?""",Prabhupāda," That means your chanting is not pure. That is called aparādha . You are thinking that ""I am chanting, I am purified,"" and finding out another woman, illicit sex. Then how you can be purified?"
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : One argument a lot of them use is that, er,...",Prabhupāda," No. It is prohibited, aparādha . If you chant with aparādha , offenses, then how you can be pure?"
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : The process is to follow some rules and regulations, but they say, ""How do you get the strength to follow the rules and regulations?""",Prabhupāda," That is not your business, that is Kṛṣṇa's business. You follow Kṛṣṇa . If you cheat Kṛṣṇa , then you'll be cheated. That's all. Kṛṣṇa does not cheat you, but you create a situation to cheat yourself, and māyā will make an arrangement so that you are cheated. This is māyā 's business."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : So it's a question of honesty.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You promise no illicit sex, no, before God, before spiritual master, before fire, and you play hypocrisy. So māyā is not seeing that? How you can avoid? māyā is always there. Yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala - grahāṇām . You cannot escape the eyes of God in so many different agencies. And still He is personally sitting within your hearts. How you can escape? You may pretend to be a very great devotee, but the Person, Supreme, He is within yourself, He's seeing everything. No cheating with Him. Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa - buddhiḥ . ""Oh, I am chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa , so even I do something wrong, it will be adjusted."" Adjusted, when you are sincere, by chance you have done something. That can be adjusted. But not intentionally. As soon as there is intentional cheating, that you'll have to suffer the effect."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : So someone who is in knowledge and commits sinful activity...,Prabhupāda, Then he's...
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...his position is very bad...,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, yes."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : ...compared to the innocent person, ignorant person.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Daivī hy eṣā guṇa - mayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] .
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : But then again he argues like this, he says, ""The living entity cannot do anything without the sanction of God. So I am desiring certain sinful activities, but why is Kṛṣṇa sanctioning it?""",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa does not sanction.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Then how is it going on?,Prabhupāda," But you insist, so Kṛṣṇa , in disgust, says, ""All right, do at your own risk. You rascal. You will not hear Me."" That's all. I have given this example many times, that my son wanted to touch the table fan. Did I say it?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : I never heard it.,Prabhupāda," Oh, so, when he was only two years old, so the table fan was running, and the child, he wants to touch it. So I am: ""No, don't touch."" So, and he was.... So there was another friend, he was a doctor. He said that ""Slow the speed and let him touch."" So I did it. So he touched, ""Tung."" (sound imitation) Then I said, ""Touch again?"" ""No!"" (laughter) So it is like that."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Oh. It is actually Kṛṣṇa's mercy...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : ...that He allows Him to feel the pain.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hari-śauri; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Hari - śauri : Purifies his desires.; Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : But he doesn't have to feel the pain if he's obedient.; Rāmeśvara : If he insists.,Prabhupāda," He gives instruction. Just like I said, ""Don't touch. It will hurt your finger. It is not good."" ""No, no."" ""So all right, touch."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa : You mentioned that the more intelligent person can become obedient by hearing. The less intelligent person has to see, suffer.",Prabhupāda," By practical experience. Dekhe sekhe thekhe sekhese. Tekhe sekhese(?) means he's a fool. Unless he comes to the actual position, he does not learn. And therefore śāstra -cakṣus —one who follows the śāstra's instruction, he is safe. That is experienced already. (end)"
Reporter,I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about your routine. I understand that you only sleep about two or three hours a day. And do you usually sleep during the middle of the daytime as well?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Daytime I sleep two hours, and night also two hours."
Reporter,Ah! Two hours at night also.,Prabhupāda, Hmm.
Reporter,Does it...? Is it more difficult to do this when you're traveling a lot?,Prabhupāda," No. I..., my work is going on. By traveling also, I carry this machine. Dicta..., dictaphone. I dictate, and then my assistants, they write, transcribe, and then it is..., it goes to the Press. In this way my work is.... (noise comes from outside)"
Reporter,"I'd like to ask one.... Is your role in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the United States particularly or worldwide? Ten years ago, when you first came to the United States, did you take a very active role in the organization, and I'm wondering whether you do much of that now?",Prabhupāda," No, although the volume of work has.... [break] ...a hundred times, but these American disciples, they are helping me, so I haven't got to work personally so much. I simply give the instruction and they carry out, but the work has increased voluminously, there's no doubt it. I came here alone in 1965 without any help practically. Where to live, where to sleep, there was no destination. Sometimes some friend's house, sometimes some friend's house, practically loitering on the street. And in this way were passed more than one year. I arrived here in 1965 in September, end of September, 17th of September, in Boston. Hm. Is it Boston?"
Devotee (1),"Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Then, in Boston, I stayed on the sea, on the only, but I saw the Boston city. Then I was brought to New York. So I had one friend in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hm. After my arrival, I was received by some representative of my host. So he took me to Butler, and there I stayed for twenty days. Then I came to New York. [break] One (indistinct), one Dr. Miśra , so that is the beginning of my life in New York. Then struggling, then gradually, when these boys came to me, I got some relief. And in this way, we are propagating, opening branches, and the movement is going forward."
Reporter,"Are there many decisions that people asked you to make, about whether the movement should do this, or should do that, or do they bother you of that now, or are you just busy writing and translating?",Prabhupāda," No, we do not accept any—what is called?—defective suggestion. We do not accept. We have got our program. This program is coming directly from Kṛṣṇa . The Bhagavad- gītā is there."
Reporter,OK.,Prabhupāda, So we are simply giving a practical set(?) of the instruction of Gītā . This is our business. We don't manufacture any imaginative thing.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : His idea.... His question, Prabhupāda, is also, suppose someone wants to buy a farm or wants to do some new project. Do they ask your permission first?",Prabhupāda," Yes. The whole society is going on under my direction. Whatever they do, they take my permission and they put into (indistinct). Nothing is allowed without my permission."
Reporter,"I wonder if you might have any opinions on some of the leaders of cults and groups in the United States, such as the Divine Light Mission, or the T.M. and so forth. I'm wondering if you have any opinions on Guru Maharaj-ji or Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .",Prabhupāda," There are different groups. I know that. But I do not go in detail to understand them. But our..., we have got a crucial test. That anyone who is..., does not know about Kṛṣṇa , he is put into four different types of categories as it is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . One category is that he is sinful. Another category is that he is rascal. Another category is that he's lowest of the mankind. Another category is that his so-called knowledge is taken away by illusory energy. So this is our test. That is stated in Bhagavad- gītā , that"
Reporter,"Do you have any opinion about Ted Patrick, who I guess you've probably heard of?",Prabhupāda," I, I do not care to read these persons. But I have no business, because we are strictly following Kṛṣṇa , our signboard is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So anyone who does not know anything about Kṛṣṇa , we reject him immediately. That's all, simple business."
Reporter,Is the only way to know Kṛṣṇa through the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Certainly. If you want to know me, then you must know about me from me. You can not speculate about me. If you speculate that ""Swamiji is so rich,"" or ""Swami might have so much bank balance also,"" or.... This is all speculation. But when I say that my bank balance is such and such, that is right knowledge."
Reporter,I didn't understand you.,Prabhupāda," That suppose if you are speculating what may be the Swamiji's strength of bank balance. So how you can know it by speculation? But if I say that my bank balance is such and such, than you can understand what is bank balance. So by speculative knowledge you can not understand God. When God says what He is, then you can understand."
Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Reporter,"Do you feel also that if someone read the Bhagava ...? I can't pronounce it...; Rāmeśvara : Bhagavad- gītā .; ... Bhagavad- gītā and other books, that a person merely by reading these could attain knowledge of Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not?
Reporter,Would that person have to have contact with you and learn from you also?,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is explained, there is no difficulty. But if there is difficulty to understand, then we have to approach a person who has understood Bhagavad- gītā . Otherwise the language is very plain, there is no difficulty. Unfortunately they bring their own interpretation and spoil the whole thing."
Reporter,Ah...?,Prabhupāda," Otherwise where is the difficulty? Just like the beginning of Bhagavad- gītā it is said,"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : ...culture,Prabhupāda, Yes. Attentive.
Reporter,You don't see any slowing down of the impact of...,Prabhupāda, No. It can be slowed down unless we spoil it.
Reporter,Is there anyone who is designated to succeed you as the primary teacher of the movement?,Prabhupāda," I am training some, I mean to say, advanced students so that they may be very easily take up the charge. I have made them GBC. They are under my direct training, and I think they will be able to conduct this movement."
Reporter,Do you expect to name one person as your successor or have you already?,Prabhupāda," That I am not contemplating now. But there is no need of one person. As other things are managed, but by committee, so this can also be managed, and the committee may elect one person as chief. As, just like in the democracy there are senators and there is president, so it may be I may nominate or they can nominate."
Reporter,Do you feel are you in good health now? You look it.,Prabhupāda," Yes. After all, of course I am some eighty, eighty years old. And I complete eighty years next September. So the age is there, although I am feeling not aged by..., the effect of age must be there."
Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Reporter,"I didn't understand that.; Rāmeśvara : He says although.... Prabhupāda says although he's not feeling aged, the effect of age is there.; When I interviewed you perhaps five or six years ago, it was before there were reports of the astronauts landing on the moon, and I asked you at that time if you thought, what you thought about it, and you said that, as I recall, that they would not be able to land or explore, because spirits or creatures that lived on the moon would not allow it. The reports of course said that indeed people did land and explore and return safely. I understand you have further thoughts about that (laughter) and you've even written a lot about it. I wonder if you could tell me, not at great length perhaps, but what your belief about those events is.",Prabhupāda," Yes. From the.... That question I was discussing the other day. In the common sense, gross sense, that all over the world, they accept Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, in this way Saturday last. So why these arrangement? Sunday first and Monday second, and nobody could reply it. But as a layman I can conclude that Sun planet is first and the moon planet is next. So if you cannot go to the sun planet, which is ninety-three million miles away, how you can go to the moon planet within four days? Nobody could answer me. Can you answer?"
Reporter,"Well, I don't think it's worth the answer now, but I'm wondering what your response is.",Prabhupāda," But this is the arrangement all over the world. Sunday first, Monday second, then Tuesday. So Sun, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, in this way. Last Saturn. This is the arrangement of the planets. So if this is the arrangement of the planets, moonday next to..., moon next to sun, and if you cannot go to the sun, how can you go to the moon?"
Reporter,"Do you, in other words, do you believe that astronauts landed somewhere?",Prabhupāda," That is next question. First of all, whether you actually went to the moon, that is the first question. You have to conclude that you did not, because the sun planet is first, the moon planet is second. You cannot go to the sun planet, ninety-three millions of miles, how can you go to the moon planet?"
Reporter,"Well, except that...",Prabhupāda," According to our śāstra , the moon planet is above the sun planet, and the distance is 1,600,000 miles. So accepting that the sun is 93,000,000 miles away, then you add another 1,600,000, almost 2,000,000, it becomes 15,000,000 miles away. So if you go at the speed of 18,000 miles per hour, it takes more than 6 months. So how you go there in 4 days? And you advertise in the paper: ""Now, they have reached."" After 4 days."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They don't accept that the moon is further away.,Prabhupāda," They don't accept, that is another thing, but we have got this information. How we can accept it?"
Reporter; Rāmeśvara; Reporter; Rāmeśvara,"I didn't understand that last.; Rāmeśvara : I said to Prabhupāda that the modern man believes that the moon is closer, but Prabhupāda said, ""But our ancient literatures teach that the moon is further away."" So since we have that information, how can we accept the version of the modern scientists?; Hm hm.; Rāmeśvara : We've got...",Prabhupāda," Not only that. Why this arrangement that Monday and, Sunday first, Monday second?"
Reporter,"Well, that doesn't necessarily speak of distance.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Reporter,It doesn't necessarily speak of distance.,Prabhupāda," That.... Distance may not be, but you have to accept the sun planet first, moon planet next."
Reporter,Er...,Prabhupāda, Distance is not the question.
Reporter,OK.,Prabhupāda," Why this arrangement: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday? There is some system. The system is, just like first, second, third, fourth. So it is naturally concluded the moon planet is next to the sun planet."
Reporter,"Do you feel—maybe you answered this, but I didn't understand the answer—do you feel that astronauts did land somewhere, but it was some other planet?",Prabhupāda, That may be. Or it may not be also.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : What about that sometimes people ask us what about the pictures of man on the moon?; Rāmeśvara : They show man in a spacesuit walking on some other planet.,Prabhupāda," That is also, what is called, argumentative. Somebody says it is arbitrary arrangement."
Reporter,Hm. Laboratory.,Prabhupāda," Of course, we do not go into the details of this. My question is that why Sunday first and Monday second? Nobody can apli..., replies."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Prabhupāda once also argued that the dust, the dirt that they brought back, it did not reflect any light, but the moon is always reflecting light. So it was a different substance than what must be on the moon surface.",Prabhupāda," Now, according to our Vedic scripture, Moon is one of the heavenly planets."
Reporter,Are there any other Vedic scriptures that you believe speak to a situation that is greatly misunderstood today besides this?,Prabhupāda, No. Vedic understanding means there is no different Vedic version.
Reporter,"But do people, say another example where what you hold is very different from what the rest of society holds, is there something else that would be...",Prabhupāda, No. Why...
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : No, he means, Prabhupāda, that just like modern man is thinking that they went to the moon, and our Vedic scripture says they didn't, so he's asking are there any other controversies, just like reincarnation, transmigration...",Prabhupāda," No, so far Vedic students are concerned, there are no controversies."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But from what the modern man believes there may be some differences.,Prabhupāda," Modern man believes, that's all right, but..."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : That's what his question is.,Prabhupāda," Our, our basic knowledge is on the Vedic principle. That whatever.... Just like we are explaining now, veda -vihito dharmaḥ . We have to understand everything from the Vedas, from this Vedic knowledge. So anything which does not speak acc.... in terms of the Vedic formula, we do not accept such knowledge as valid."
Reporter,OK.,Prabhupāda, But practically you are seeing that. But...
Reporter,"Would you accept conclusions from science that..., only if it agreed with the Vedic scriptures?",Prabhupāda, First of all.... As you say science. What do you mean by science? Can you explain?
Reporter,"Well, what the..., the best conclusions of the best people in science.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That's all right, but what is the best conclusion?"
Reporter,"Well, rely on their opinions.",Prabhupāda," That is opinion, the opinion is changing. How you can rely? That is not fixed up. So what is this opinion, what is the value of this opinion?"
Reporter,Well...,Prabhupāda," You give some opinion, and after some years you change it. So what is the.... How can I rely on your opinion?"
Reporter,Would Darwin's theory of evolution and other evolutionary theories...,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be. If it is being changed every year or every ten years, then what is the value of this opinion? There is no value."
Reporter,"Well, but religious thought in India has changed over the years too.",Prabhupāda, No. Nothing. We do not change. Just like your Bhagav...
Reporter,"Well, others ...",Prabhupāda, Bhagav...
Reporter,Others change.,Prabhupāda," Ah, others may deviate, that's another thing. But the system is not that. You cannot deviate from the Vedic injunction that if you have to follow the ācāryas, just like India is obeying. The mass population or the sane population, they are following the ācāryas. Ācāryas means great teachers, bona fide teachers—perhaps you have heard their name, just like Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī , Lord Caitanya . So they are followed, and they are of the same opinion. Millions of years ago, what was the opinion, and that opinion is still there. Ācchā, take for Bhagavad- gītā . And that is.... Not a single Indian who does not accept Bhagavad- gītā as authority. This is besides the foreigners who also take interest so much in Bhagavad- gītā . So far Indians are concerned, even some of the Muhammadans, so apart from Muhammadans, those who are claiming as Hindu , they all accept the authority of Bhagavad- gītā . So this Bhagavad- gītā , they might have changed, but that is not acceptable."

Did you say that somebody would be transcribing?; Rāmeśvara : Yes, I'm going to arrange to have it transcribed.; Because there are a lot of things that I couldn't catch, just because I'm not atuned to hearing you, so a lot of words I did not understand.

Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : ...something different.,Prabhupāda," The thing is, that is practical. That scientifics statement given today, and after few days it is changed."

Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : They don't have..., the reason they don't have an idea is because before you came to America, the understanding of the science of God was presented on a kindergarten level, the Bible. So it did not satisfy their scientific mind. So because before you came to give them the Bhagavad- gītā and Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , they had not information, and they did not accept the Christian version.",Prabhupāda," No, apart from Christian or Hindu , the general mass of people, how they can say that there is no creator? From common sense?"
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : They are accepting authority, and so they say...",Prabhupāda," Apart from authority, from practical experience...."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are fools.,Prabhupāda, ...how one can...? Eh?
Ṛṣabhadeva,They are trying to avoid their responsibility to that creator. They don't want to accept.,Prabhupāda," You can avoid the creator, but you cannot say there is no creator."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It means they're totally ignorant, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," You accept the authority of the creator or not, that is your business. But you cannot say there is no creator. Just like there are many outlaws. They say also, ""We don't care for the government."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But there is a government.,Prabhupāda," But there is a government. You don't like or don't care, that is your business, but there is a government. How you can deny it? That we shall see later on, how you can neglect government. But there is a government. You have to accept."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : I think it is just in the last few hundred years that these scientists have been given so much prestige and they're making so much propaganda.

""Originally."" You do not know your case and you are going to originally. Hele data nakhe yuce.(?) You know this philosophy? Hele, there was some water snake, they have no poison. One snake charmer, he cannot catch even that. And he's trying to catch cobra. So first of all answer your case, then go to ""originally."""
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : That's what you said yesterday in discussing that philosopher Skinner. He said first we control nature, then we can control ourselves. And you replied, if you can't control yourself, how you can control such a big thing like nature?",Prabhupāda," That is the defect. They are tiny, insignificant creature and talking big, big things. This is the defect of modern civilization."

Naturally he will be ashamed to say ""Yes, I have come from some monkey."" (laughs) Unless he is a great fool, he will not say it. Then your father comes from his father, from his father....

TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, but there's some groups that did not do that.",Prabhupāda," No, some group, not. As a general practice, all Hindus they burn, from time immemorial."

TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well they couldn't figure it out until they found these bones.,Prabhupāda," That means they couldn't. Still, he says. Just see, he has brought as if he was dog, the rascal. The dog is prohibited. Man is.... [break] (walk continues on beach) ...They have got?"

Devotees; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Jaya , haribol!; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : How can we expose that, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," To expose.... They could not answer this simple question, why Sunday first and Monday second? They could not understand, these rascals, I have asked so many. Can you answer this? Can you answer, can any of you, why Sunday first? All over the world, they accept Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday last. Why? Answer this. Is there anyone?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : What is the answer, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," The answer is sun planet first, then moon planet."
Devotees,"Oh, jaya !",Prabhupāda," And the sun planet is ninety-three million miles, and according to Bhāgavata , the moon is 1,600,000 miles away from sun. So I have calculated the other day that it takes ninety days, no?"
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : No, six or seven months.",Prabhupāda, Six or seven months it takes to go to the moon planet. How they have gone in four days? They have never gone.
Devotees; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Oh, jaya !; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : How did you get that calculation, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : How did you make that calculation?,Prabhupāda," Calculation, they have calculation that sun planet is ninety-three million miles from, that is, they have accepted. I also accept it. I say the moon planet is 1,600,000 miles still further. So you cannot go to the sun planet, how can go to the moon planet?"
Devotees; Candanācārya,"Jaya .; Today is the day of scandals. These days, there are so many scandals in the United States.",Prabhupāda," Ask them. If they say moon planet is first, why not Monday first? Why Sunday first? That's a fact. Sun planet first, then moon, then Mars. Ravi , Soma , Maṅgala , Bhū . That is the calculation."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That means that all the countries are cooperating together to cheat the people, because they're all...",Prabhupāda," No, no. They have taken from the Vedic literature."
Bali-mardana,"Bali - mardana : No, they are right, Sunday, Monday.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, I mean to say that everyone is saying that they have gone to the moon, that means they are all together cheating.",Prabhupāda, Yes.

Rādhāvallabha,"They bounce sound vibration off a planet, and depending on how long it takes the vibration to come back, that's how far away the planet is. So they've calculated the sun to be further in that way.",Prabhupāda," First of all, answer why Sunday first. Then talk of all nonsense."
Candanācārya,Mars is after the moon?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Candanācārya,Mars is after the moon?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Candanācārya,"Because in French, Tuesday is the word for Mars.",Prabhupāda, And Saturday is last. Saturn is last.
Yadubara,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda," Each planet is 1,600,000 miles away from one another."

TamālaKṛṣṇa; Mahendra,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Colossal hoax.; Mahendra : ...pictures are like the King Kong movie.,Prabhupāda, Yes. In King Kong movie they made cotton as cloud. (laughs). They can do everything in the laboratory.
Yadubara,"They are making that movie again, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Spending millions to make it again.",Prabhupāda, Which movie?
Yadubara,King Kong.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : They have got some gigantic King Kong figure. It moves like a gigantic doll. Actually, to make a movie now they spend maybe ten, fifteen million dollars for one movie. [break]",Prabhupāda, They cannot cleanse nowadays?
Hari-śauri; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Hari - śauri : They made a movie called ""2001,"" and in that they had shots of men on different planets. It looked just like the moon shots. It was very..., just the same.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda, it is very difficult to convince the people that they have not gone to the moon. I mean, that's a good logic, but they'll think that's very childish for us to say ""Sunday first, Monday.""",Prabhupāda," Well, let them remain as child."
Candanācārya,"Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that if the moon is dirt and dust, how is it that it reflects the light of the sun so much that it lights up the whole planet?",Prabhupāda, Yes. The common sense. They have lost their common sense.
Candanācārya,It's so shiny that it lights up the whole earth planet at night.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Candanācārya,How can dirt reflect light like that?,Prabhupāda, That was my first question.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I think that we should write a, we should publish a little book on this, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, If you can.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Candanācārya,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Maybe one of the scientists.; There are many scientists who agree.,Prabhupāda," Now our scientists are challenging, Svarūpa Dāmodara and others."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Candanācārya,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. They could scientifically publish a book.; There are scientists in England who agree that they didn't go to the planet.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Candanācārya,There are some scientists in England who agree with you that they did not go to the moon.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they did not. Simply propaganda. ( japa ) [break] Freedom."

Rādhāvallabha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, scientists have this theory called use and disuse.

And they would say that would be the origin of that species.",Prabhupāda, Huh ? What is that?

Therefore, the other ones die off.; Hṛdayānanda : Therefore they get the long beaks?; Bali - mardana : Just from mutation.; That's not. It's another theory.; Hṛdayānanda : Madness.; It's another theory.",Prabhupāda," Hmm? So that's all right. If we are eager for Kṛṣṇa , we shall get Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotees; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Jaya .; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So we agree with that theory.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda; Hari-śauri,Hṛdayānanda : It has been given by Kṛṣṇa because he always wanted to catch fish.; Hari - śauri : They used to give us a simple example at school. They said that the people that lived in Mexico City...,Prabhupāda," No, no, we accept that. Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante [Bg. 8.6 ] . If, at the time of death, he thinks that ""If I would have possessed a beak,"" then he gets the life. That's all. (laughter) That's a fact."
Rādhāvallabha,"They say that this is the way the different types of bodies come into being, that by the desire...",Prabhupāda," That we say also. There is no difficulty. Because at the time of death, whatever you are thinking, you'll get the next body. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā ."
Rādhāvallabha,"They say, though, that this is how the different bodies come into being.",Prabhupāda," Yes, we say also."
Candanācārya,"But can any body be generated from the imagination, any kind of...",Prabhupāda," It is not this imagination. I wanted that facility. So my subtle mind is wanting that. So nature is supplying: ""All right, you get it."""
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : We don't create the bodies. We desire them, and the material nature has created already.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rādhāvallabha,"Their theory is that these bodies never before existed, but by the desire of the living entity, that certain type of body was created.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. That means nature is above. He wanted that body; nature has given. Is that correct?
Rādhāvallabha,"No, not exactly.",Prabhupāda, Then what is that?
Rādhāvallabha,"That they want a particular facility, and...",Prabhupāda," And nature supplies the body, that's all. Simple thing."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : But they do not put a limit, 8,400,000. They think that it can keep going on increasing, increasing.",Prabhupāda, Then let it go on. That's all right. What is wrong?
Candanācārya,"By their theory, though, a human being would be able to generate wings or a beak like a bird.",Prabhupāda," Yes, there are human beings who can fly in the sky. Siddhaloka, Siddhaloka. There is a planet called Siddhaloka. There the human beings from one planet to another go."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : They have wings?,Prabhupāda, No wings.
Rāmeśvara; Candanācārya; Hari-śauri,Rāmeśvara : The Gandharvas have wings.; Why do you need wings if you can fly? Also Garuḍa has a beak. Where are we going now?; Hari - śauri : Prabhupāda said in Hawaii there's no.... (pause),Prabhupāda," The old man, her father?"

Rādhāvallabha,"They will say, ""Who has set up the order?""",Prabhupāda," Anyway, you accept it. All over the world, nobody says that Monday first. Then?"
Candanācārya,"Is this also in Sanskrit language? Sunday, Monday.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes. Ask all scientists this simple question. Why, all over the world, Sunday, sun first and moon second? Why? And Saturday last. All of you could not answer this question. (devotees laugh)"

Candanācārya; Hṛdayānanda; Rāmeśvara,They may be hypnotized also.; Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda said they'd gone to Rāhu .; Rāmeśvara : They have got that dust. They say they got that from another planet.,Prabhupāda," Dust you can take it from here, from this beach."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : So then they're lying.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That means they're deliberately cheating, knowingly. And the government is backing them.",Prabhupāda, That is your business.
Rāmeśvara; Candanācārya,Rāmeśvara : What is the purpose of the cheating?; Prabhupāda said to ask for taxes.,Prabhupāda," Lābha , pūjā , pratiṣṭhā . These three things are materially wanted. Some material profit, some reputation and some.... Eh?"
Devotees,Distinction.,Prabhupāda, Adoration. These are the material demands.
Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : Because, originally, it was built up as a big thing between Russia and America, who would get to the moon first.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Now they are shaking hands, and none of them has gone. ""I thank you."""

There were these tailors, and they made believe that they were making clothes for the emperor, but actually they were doing nothing, but they were making the motions. So they, everybody was saying what nice clothes and finally...; No, they said, any intelligent, only intelligent people will see the clothes.; Hṛdayānanda : And someone who's a fool, he cannot see it.; Rāmeśvara : Magic cloth.; So they were getting much money for making nothing.; Hṛdayānanda : The emperor went out naked in the street, and everyone was afraid to admit that there was no clothes.; Rāmeśvara : B ecause they would be labeled fool. So finally one boy said, ""But the emperor has no clothes.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, there is a nice story in this connection. There was one Gopal Ban. So he was very cunning fellow. In the Muhammadan period in Bengal. So the Mohammedan Nawab asked him, ""Gopal Ban, can you prepare a Mahābhārata in my name?"" ""Oh, yes!"" So, ""I'll engage so many paṇḍitas, and they will make a Mahābhārata, your activities, your glories, everything. So give me one hundred thousand rupees, just begin."" He was taking money, taking money, ""Yes, it is going on, going on."" ""Then when it will be published?"" ""Yes, just last few days more. Now, sir, everything is prepared. So the one thing is, you have to give me information how many husbands you have got, your wife, huh ? How many husbands your wife has got?"" That is very insulting. ""What, you nonsense, you take."" ""No, that is the main feature of Mahābhārata. Draupadī had five husbands, so how many husbands your wife has got? Tell me that."" Then, ""No, no, I don't want that. I am the only husband."" ""Then how can you write Mahābhārata ?"" (laughter) ""I don't want."" ""All right. If you want Mahābhārata you must tell how many your wife has got husbands."" That he cannot say. So Mahābhārata finished."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And he kept the money.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That already, he took that ""I have to steal to pay so much money. Give me."" That's all right. So these are, scientists are doing like that. At the end, how many husbands your wife has got."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Scientists are doing the same thing.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rādhāvallabha; Hṛdayānanda; Rādhāvallabha,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Taking money.; They have one argument, that during solar eclipse, the moon appears to pass in front of the sun, between the sun and the earth.; Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda explains that. It is the Rāhu planet.; But they are viewing the moon. The moon is right there, they can see it. And all of a sudden it goes in front of the sun.",Prabhupāda," Huh ? What is that? Moon is there, sun is there. Now which first? That is the question."
Rādhāvallabha,"They will say that they've observed in their telescopes...,",Prabhupāda," They'll say..., whatever they'll say it is all right. First of all, say why Sunday first. Then talk all nonsense. First of all, answer this. You cannot say ""We believe that Sunday first."" What is the fact? Why do you bring moon, Monday? Why not bring...?"
Rādhāvallabha,They will say it is arbitrary order.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Rādhāvallabha,Then they will get back to their argument.,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . Arbitrary order is not science. That you cannot.
Candanācārya; Rādhāvallabha; Hṛdayānanda; Mahendra,"How can it be arbitrary if every culture in the history of the planet has accepted that order? How can it be arbitrary?; That doesn't matter it's not arbitrary. Do you accept?; Hṛdayānanda : Rādhāvallabha is a rascal. (laughter); Mahendra : Thirty or forty years also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, one man made a little plaster body of a human being, and he planted it in his back yard in England. And then he dug it up and said, ""Oh, look, I've found the oldest man in history!"" And all the scientists came and said, ""Oh, yes, this is the oldest man in history."" And for twenty or thirty years many men got their Ph.D.s by writing about how this plaster was the oldest man in history.",Prabhupāda," Yes, such fools are leaders."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rādhāvallabha,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That is the business of dogs, digging up bones.

Hari-śauri,"Hari - śauri : One thing is, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they've wrongly calculated the distance of the moon, then how is it that they're able to calculate these eclipses and whatever?",Prabhupāda," That I do not know. First of all, answer this. Yes. Yes. They say the moon planet first. I say, no, sun planet. First of all..."
Trivikrama; Candanācārya,Trivikrama : (?) But they can see the moon comes in front of the sun.; This is some other planet.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Candanācārya,That must be some other planet.,Prabhupāda, Which one?
Candanācārya,This one that comes in front of the sun.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, all over the world, they accept Sunday first."
Mahendra,"Mahendra : All of their successes are accidental. Just like they discovered the planet called Pluto. The way it was discovered was one man recognized that there was a fluctuation in the orbit of the planet Neptune, and so he made some calculations and figured that the fluctuations were caused by another planet that must be further away than Neptune that no one has discovered yet. So he made many calculations and figured out where the planet should be, how big it should be, how much it should weigh, how far away it was. So then he told other scientists about it, and they looked in their telescopes, and sure enough, there it was. But it wasn't as big as he said, nor was it as heavy as he said, nor was it as far away as he said, and when they rechecked the data they found that the orbit of the original planet wasn't really wrong either. So all of his calculations were wrong, but still the planet was there. So somehow or other he stumbled upon it, but all of his calculations to find it were absolutely wrong. That's the planet called Pluto.",Prabhupāda, Recently there was an propaganda. That comet?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, it would come and destroy,",Prabhupāda, There was no comet.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They said it would destroy...,Prabhupāda, Destroy...
Hṛdayānanda; Rāmeśvara,"Hṛdayānanda : They predicted a comet that never came.; Rāmeśvara : Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the Fifth Canto you wrote that the planets are being pulled in their orbits by chariots. Just like there is a description of the sun planet, and there is very elaborate...",Prabhupāda," That is movement. Now, according to their calculation, sun is fixed up, but according to our calculation it is moving. That is the difference."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : And it is actually being pulled by a chariot and horses.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, it is moving. Either chariot or on leg. That does not.... It is moving. Moving is the point. Either on chariot or on leg, that doesn't matter. Sun is moving. But they say sun is fixed up."
Trivikrama,"Trivikrama : They say it's moving, but not the way we say, around the earth.",Prabhupāda," No, they do not say."
Trivikrama,Trivikrama : They say it has it's own...,Prabhupāda," No, no. Sun is fixed up."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : It is moving by manipulation of air, just like our airplane is moving by manipulating the air.",Prabhupāda," First of all, solve this question, that how...?"
Rādhāvallabha,You had us on that one.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Rādhāvallabha,You got us on that one.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : He said you have caught us. We cannot give a reply.,Prabhupāda," Yes, big, big belly. And what is that, Bhārgava , no, what is his name? Bhagavat ?"
Devotees,Bhagavat .,Prabhupāda," He has got big belly. (laughter) And Brahmānanda . Gargamuni also. Acyutānanda , yes. In India?"
Devotee,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,"These karmīs and their sputniks, they're claiming they're going to heavenly planets, all these planets all over the universe, but you tell us that they can't actually go to these places.",Prabhupāda," Yes, if you have got suitable machine you can go."
Bhūdhara,Bhūdhara : Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhūdhara,"Bhūdhara : They now say that they're going to attempt to create a planet that has perfect air, and trees, and they're only charging...",Prabhupāda," Another bogus. Another bluff. So be satisfied with their bluffs. That's all. (break, conversation continues in car)"
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : The sun planet is seated on a chariot, and it is pulled by horses? They take it to be mythology.",Prabhupāda, Why?
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Rāmeśvara : They cannot imagine how horses can be flying in the sky.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And pulling an entire planet.,Prabhupāda," Because you cannot imagine it, there is no such thing? What is the value of your imagination?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But you just said by your imagination you can grow a beak.,Prabhupāda," If some horses can fly in the sky, what your imagination will check it?"
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But they say that the planet is so heavy and so big it is not possible for a mortal...,Prabhupāda, That's all right. The planet is.... How it is floating in the air?
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They have an explanation for that.,Prabhupāda," No. You do not know the explanation. There are so many other things. Just like we say there is ocean of milk, ocean of liquor, ocean of oil."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : No, all of that they take to be...; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Mythology.; Rāmeśvara : ...imagination.",Prabhupāda, But why? Your imagination. You have not gone throughout the whole universe. You cannot say. You are imperfect.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But they say neither you have gone, so how can you know...",Prabhupāda," No, I have got authority, you have got no authority."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Well, simply some story books, they say.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. Whatever it may be, I can present some literature, but you have nothing. You rascal. (laughs) Whatever it may be, I have got something, but you have nothing."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I remember studying in college about this, that we were studying Indian art, and they showed pictures of people on other planets and all these things, the demigods, and the teacher said ""These are mythologies of India.""; Rāmeśvara : Just like the Greek mythologies.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, we have got books, and these books are authorized, they are accepted by authorities, but what you have got?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They have their fairy tales, they call it, imaginary tales.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, we have got something. I may believe it. That's all. You believe your imagination, we believe this. That's all. Finished."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Ours are better.,Prabhupāda," Your imagination is also rascaldom, and if ours, it is rascaldom, that's all right, you are rascal, I am rascal. Why do you pose yourself you are learned?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that's the point.",Prabhupāda, Don't pose yourself that you are learned.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : They say that for thousands and thousands of years man has believed in God, and as a result...",Prabhupāda," That I am speaking daily, you must believe in God, the creator."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They say that before the scientific revolution...,Prabhupāda," There is no scientific. It is all rascal revolution. If you cannot answer these questions that you are created by your father, so why there should be no original creator? You cannot say that you have dropped from the sky."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, originally, everything came, man came from the monkey, monkey came from another animal, and everything came from an atom.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. Come to practical, that you are created by your father. That you have to accept. So similarly, everything we see.... This car is created by someone. Everything we see, created. So how can you say there is no creator? Within our experience we see everything is created by someone."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Creative energy is there.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, the fact is..."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Impersonal.,Prabhupāda," Not impersonal, personal."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : But then who created the creator?,Prabhupāda," Huh ? That we shall see, but first of all you have to accept there is a creator."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : They will agree, some people will agree...",Prabhupāda, That's all right.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : ...that there is energy for creating.,Prabhupāda, Whatever it may be.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : But they do not give one person the credit.,Prabhupāda," No, no, no. Just like this manufacturer of this car, he's not handling this creation by his own hand. He has got money, energy. He pays the mechanical person to create, but ultimately it is Ford. Ford is not creating everything. Ford's money, Ford's employees, workers, they are creating, but the name is Ford. Similarly, everything is being created by God. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram [Bg. 9.10 ]. And He has got so many working hands. That is also.... Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65 , purport]. Multi-energies, they are doing like that.... But He is supervising, ""Have you done this?"" ""Yes."" ""That's all. Go on."" So how can you go beyond your experience? Everything is created. A child may think, ""How this car is created?"" But it is, factually it is created. He cannot imagine how this nice car is created. Why child? Even elderly persons in a nondeveloped country, they'll be surprised how this car is created. They cannot do it."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No. That means they're ignorant.,Prabhupāda," That's all. So you cannot imagine that the sky is created, this water is created, that is beyond your experience."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Because you cannot do it, you think no one can do it.",Prabhupāda," You cannot do it. But why another cannot do it? As I see, I cannot manufacture the car, but somebody else can do it. Similarly, the whole big thing, cosmic manifestation, I cannot do it, but somebody may do it."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are small-minded.; Rāmeśvara : It's like you were saying for this philosopher, Sartre. We see our practical experience is that someone has less intelligence, someone has more intelligence. So we should understand that God means...",Prabhupāda, The ultimate intelligence. That's all.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : So now these governments are very rascal. They are cheating the people deliberately.,Prabhupāda," Well, government means combination of cheaters like you. What do you expect more than that? If you are cheaters, then you go to the government. Someway or other get vote. Bribe or something nefarious you do and get vote, and they become cheap government man. And then do your business. Because you are cheater, you have come to the post of prestige and power. What you will do? You know simply only cheat."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So he'll cheat more.,Prabhupāda, That's all. You have now got the power. You cheat more.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : The people in America that claim that the American government is controlled by Communists. They say that these big, big bankers, the very rich, rich people, that they are actually..., their theory is Communist government, or, not Communist, dictatorship, and that they are secretly manipulating.",Prabhupāda, What is their aim?
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Power.,Prabhupāda," Power..., anyone who has got money, he has got power. That is open secret. What is the secret? (laughs) If you have got money, you have got all power."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They're very expert in making the people think that this is democracy and that the people have power. (static),Prabhupāda," If you can purchase vote by paying money, then where is democracy?"
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Just like one of their arguments is that these rich bankers, they can control how much money is being printed.",Prabhupāda," Yes, suppose I stand for presidency, and I take money from bank and bribe and get vote."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : So they can actually create, by their control, a depression.",Prabhupāda," Yes, money can buy. The real thing is money. That is stated in the Bhāgavata . Money is the criterion in the Kali - yuga . If you have got money, then you don't require anything; you can purchase anything."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Purchase justice.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, anything. That is stated in the Bhāgavata . So therefore people are trying to get money somehow or other. Then he knows, ""I get all power."" The present struggle is everyone is trying to get more, more, more, more money. Because everyone knows if I get money then I.... (static) Just like the Beatles and others. Actually what they have got qualification? They have got money. (static) That's all. What qualification? Singer. Singer, according to Vedic culture, third-class, fourth-class man."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hari-śauri,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Śūdra.; Hari - śauri : Most of these famous guys, they are all really the lowest grade people as well. Very low grade.",Prabhupāda," Otherwise, this John Lennon, how he dares to photograph naked with his lover? How lowest class man he is, that he has no shame even. And he's also big man. Press reporters go to take his opinion on certain subject matters. They do not know where I am going to take opinion. What is the value of this man? But people are after money. Why? ""I have got money."" That's all."
Devotee,They hold great sway with the general public as well.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : One of the reasons why they did not want John Lennon to be allowed to stay in the United States is because they said that he had too much influence with the young people.,Prabhupāda," Yes, he spoiled these. They are already spoiled, and (static) that the government has done nice thing. What is his value? But because he has got money (static) popularity, he has become big man."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : So there is this theory that there is a conspiracy all over the world that the rich men to control.,Prabhupāda," That is, we say. If you have got money, you can make conspiracy or anything, whatever you like. Conspiracy I cannot make, I have no money, I cannot make conspiracy. But if I have got money, I can develop a conspiracy with my money. That one man asked, ""Have you got any intelligence?"" The man began to.... ""Let me see."" ""What is that?"" ""I am seeing my pocket."" ""Why pocket?"" ""Intelligence means pocket."" If there is money in my pocket, then there is intelligence. Otherwise, there is no intelligence. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita also said, daridra -doṣo guṇa -rāśir nāśī . A man may be very, very big, qualified man, but if he's poor, everything's finished. Daridra -doṣo guṇa -rāśir nāśī ."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : So when they come to our temples and they see that the temple is very opulent, then they think we are intelligent.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, they are more and more now.; Rāmeśvara : The church does this.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : More and more our society is getting respect because of the big buildings.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : New York.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's why, I think your Guru Mahārāja was in favor like that.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, he said that potthor katha ke usa cane gauri ber katha sundari (?) If you remain poor, then nobody will be..."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : And this diorama project will also give us a lot of respect.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. We have got many things, stock. We shall exhibit gradually. We have got many things in stock."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Many new ideas.,Prabhupāda," First of all, I started the book. That is, by Kṛṣṇa's grace, it is becoming successful. Then diorama. Then I shall give next idea."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This diorama is a major idea.,Prabhupāda, (laughs)
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : I brought the Time magazine people to see it. They were so impressed they wanted to come when the museum is open, to make a story.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They never saw anything like it.,Prabhupāda, Deal with them very nicely. We get publicity.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : It's very costly.,Prabhupāda," Never mind. Cost, Kṛṣṇa will send money."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This project here will cost, how much? About seventy...; Rāmeśvara : The actual project, without considering how much the devotees live on, forty thousand dollars.",Prabhupāda, Never mind.
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : That's the budget for the project, not counting the devotee maintenance.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : More than that.",Prabhupāda, Never mind. You can you can raise that four times price.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So we don't mind the cost?,Prabhupāda, No.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And the BBT is paying part of the...,Prabhupāda," And at least, by tickets, people will pay ten dollars."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Yes, that's Bharadvāja's idea, to tickets.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Otherwise, how we will raise the money? Book Fund cannot give."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : The Book Fund has been giving one half...; Rāmeśvara : But now...,Prabhupāda," That can be given as loan, not for..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : As loan, the whole thing...; Rāmeśvara : Originally you told me wherever they go, the temple will pay fifty percent and the BBT will pay fifty percent.",Prabhupāda," No, that is loan."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,Rāmeśvara : Oh.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's got to be a loan.,Prabhupāda," BBT is, our policy is fifty percent for reprinting and fifty percent for temple. Nothing else."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Strict.; Rāmeśvara : But that fifty percent for temple is only as loan.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : Except in India (laughs), then it is gift.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Because we are rich Americans.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is contribution to your Guru Mahārāja ."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Right.; Rāmeśvara : (laughs) Jaya .; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That is our guru - dakṣiṇā .; Rāmeśvara : There is just one problem, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If the temple thinks that they are going to have to pay for the entire project, it is so costly that they don't want to pay so much. They cannot afford. That's why you originally...",Prabhupāda," If they cannot pay, we are not going to hang them. But the condition is this: They must pay."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Maybe for those who will not pay, we could do simple ones, just with the, a...",Prabhupāda," We do not say that ""If you cannot pay, I will hang you."" No. ""Pay, try to pay."" (static) In our Hyderabad scheme, we have taken three, four lakhs loan from you. And he has taken, Jayapatākā has taken, you know? Nobody has paid me. Till now. But there is promise they will pay."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that's good. At least the big temples, Rāmeśvara , in the beginning can certainly afford it.; Rāmeśvara : On a long-term basis.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, I won't even, for New York, I won't even take a loan.",Prabhupāda," No, we can forward loan if it is absolutely necessary."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I won't need it. We have the money.,Prabhupāda," Oh, this side also road is becoming..."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : All the way down from the beach to downtown Los Angeles.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Fixing it.; Rāmeśvara : This is going to be one of the main streets in Los Angeles.,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's great.,Prabhupāda, ( japa ) (end)
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : ...been a kīrtana leader in his previous lifetime, how could he take so naturally to Sanskrit and chanting like that?",Prabhupāda, This boy?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. He's just like a Bengali kīrtana leader. He joined the movement when he was only sixteen years old. Very...; Rāmeśvara : Jagannātha dāsa has just come back from Vṛndāvana . I think he's going to help on the books again. That will speed things up. Everything is going slowly through Sanskrit still.,Prabhupāda, (looking at bones?) Chicken?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : No, some animal, bigger animal.; Rāmeśvara : Ribs? Lamb, sheep.",Prabhupāda," [break] ...kill. Simply kill. Paśu - ghna . As soon as you become animal killer, Kṛṣṇa consciousness finished. Parīkṣit Mahārāja , vinā paśu - ghnāt . Except the persons who are killers of animals, everyone will be interested."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : One good thing is that there is generally a growing movement amongst American people, and I don't know about other countries, for vegetarianism. People are becoming more and more.... I think it is due to our books, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Book distribution, we are educating the people in that way.",Prabhupāda," Actually, we are educating; that's a fact."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Many vegetarian societies now.,Prabhupāda," [break] ...they say, Santa Monica?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, it is cleaner there.; Rāmeśvara : Yesterday you suggested that I send groups of brahmacāriṇīs to that farm in Oregon where Yamunā -mātājī is staying, but I was thinking that, actually, she is a very, very wonderful preacher, and if she can visit our temples more often, then she can.... In other words, it's more expensive and difficult to send so many people to her...",Prabhupāda," So, do that."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : Otherwise, she can come to us.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It's also a healthier environment, I think. It's a little...; Rāmeśvara : She lives alone with Dīna -tāriṇī. She doesn't have much association. She's keeping herself apart a little bit.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, I think, that's one..., there's one disadvantage is that they have a little bit of a, their attitude is a little bit separatist from ISKCON in the sense of keeping aloof, and if the girls go there and live there, they may develop that same mentality. It might be better for her to come to the temples to teach.",Prabhupāda, Then make arrangement; I have not objection.
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : (laughs) She has objection. We can't force her.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That's the problem. And if that's her feeling, then if you send people there they'll get the same.",Prabhupāda, [break] Worshiping Deity.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes. Oh, they're doing that beautifully, and they're expert cooks. They're very good devotees.; Rāmeśvara : They could just be so valuable to helping our temples if they agreed to preach to our devotees. They could train. [break] ...brought the reporters from Time magazine over to see our temple. I had Mother Yamunā prepare some prasādam , and she was also serving them, and then she was explaining about prasādam and preaching. So I could understand that as long as she stays on that farm, she's limiting herself, because she's an excellent preacher. She could be very valuable, expert preacher. In her.... Their idea is that they would like to make their farm a little bigger, with more women living with them.",Prabhupāda, I like that idea.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : There will be no man to help give advice, just the women manage it all themselves.",Prabhupāda," Just like in Vṛndāvana there is bhajanāśrama, they're only women."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Śyāmabhajis?,Prabhupāda," Not śyāmabhajis, but bhajanāśrama."
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : So that's a good idea.,Prabhupāda," With man is dangerous for both. I, I have given that: man is good, woman is good, when they come together-bad. Both of them bad."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Bad. We see that.; Rāmeśvara : They say that that farmland in Oregon is too small, very small.",Prabhupāda, Let them organize that.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Jagadīśa was telling me that there are some boys who are donating seventy-five acres of farmland about four hours from Los Angeles. It is the best farmland in California. So he wants to develop this, because they have given it to him, specifically to make a farm and eventually to have the children of Gurukula live there. So perhaps we could invite Yamunā .",Prabhupāda," As soon as you make Gurukula, government immediately stops."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Devotee,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Stopped. That's the same (indistinct). The government can't raise objection. Better to keep it real small. Children are learning, then they are sent to India when they're eight or ten. The children here are doing very nicely.; The children here are doing as nicely as in Dallas, I've seen.",Prabhupāda," Yes, small groups, small group."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, and it forces all the temples to have a community, which is nice.",Prabhupāda," Government rascals will come, ""Do this, do that, do that,"" and they will never be satisfied, because their business is to tease."
Hari-śauri,Hari - śauri : Simply to harass.,Prabhupāda," Harass. So that they may not extend this philosophy, no meat-eating, Then their business will be spoiled."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yeah. We represent a threat to them.,Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore they do not like this program anywhere. No meat-eating, no drinking, no illicit sex. Then what remains? Everything is finished."
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Actually, we have many enemies in America.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, naturally."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Everywhere.; Rāmeśvara : When we printed that Kṛṣṇa Consciousness is Authorized, that little booklet, we gave the names of professors who appreciated our movement, and their school, their college. So there are some demons in America who.... Well, like we gave the name and address of the professor in that book. So some demons in America got a hold of that book, and wrote all the professors letters blaspheming our movement and Your Divine Grace and telling them that ""Professor, you should withdraw your name. You are giving your support to a horrible movement."" So we have many enemies.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Did the professors write back?; Rāmeśvara : Dr. Judah got a copy of one such letter, and he mailed it to Jayādvaita, so I've seen it. Very, very blasphemous, poisonous, but it was written by a very educated person. I could tell by the style of writing that the person who wrote that letter was very literate.",Prabhupāda, He did not disclose his name?
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Yes, his name and address.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : That person gave his name and address, who wrote that letter?; Rāmeśvara : Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda, So we cannot bring it to the court?
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : Perhaps. I'll see. But this is an example.,Prabhupāda," No, I know that."
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Hari-śauri; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : It is mostly from parents. Parents have had bad experience that they have lost their children to this movement.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes, that's the big propaganda now. The, there's one.... There's a number of men who kidnap, their professional business is to kidnap devotees and other people who belong to other groups like ours. And they're paid by the parents to kidnap the children back, and they call it deprogram the children, deprogramming.; Hari - śauri : Prabhupāda saw that article on that Ted Patrick.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : I saw it in New York recently, our president, (sic:) Ādikeśa, he went up against Ted Patrick on television, big television show, and he completely defeated him. So Ted Patrick was saying that, you know, these people are all fanatics. So (sic:) Ādikeśa, at the end, he said, so, if we're fanatics, then the Pope is even more fanatical, so why don't you deprogram him? And everybody laughed at that Ted Patrick. (laughter); Rāmeśvara : He says we teach our.... I mean he has many arguments. He knows all about the incidents in Germany and Japan , and he uses this against us.",Prabhupāda, He's collected all these bad.
Rāmeśvara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Rāmeśvara : ""Lying and cheating,"" he says.; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : A few devotees who have joined him, who left and have joined him, they have given him this inside information, so he tries.... Actually, though, no strong devotee can be changed by him. He only gets the very new men. So now he's written a book.",Prabhupāda, About us?

And this very big publisher, who published the book, has spent lots of money in advertising. And the advertising always uses our name, because it's controversial. They always try to get people to buy the book, saying ""Now you can read about the dangerous Hare Kṛṣṇa people.""; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : (laughs) It's a good propaganda, I think.; Rāmeśvara : But we're trying to stop that.",Prabhupāda, America is feeling the strength of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : And everyone is rākṣasa practically. If the government even understood your mission in coming here, they would never have granted you this permanent residence visa .

TamālaKṛṣṇa; Rādhāvallabha,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : So we should do that. Whenever we preach to anyone and we tell them, I tell them that I have not gone to the movie house for ten years, they say ""Oh, how horrible! Inhuman!""
