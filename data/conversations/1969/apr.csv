Gargamuni,Swamiji? Didn'tKarṇarequestArjunanot to fight when he was lifting the chariot? Didn'tKarṇarequestArjunanot to kill him?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Request. ButKṛṣṇasaid, ""No. You kill him. I say.""Arjunasaid, ""That's all right. (laughter) When You order me, 'Fight,' I don't care for any morality or discipline. Your order is 'Fight.' """
Devotee,Can you chant for us loudly? Can you chant from theBhāgavata?,Prabhupāda," Yes, I'll chant.HareKṛṣṇa. Oh, thank you very much. All should be offered there,Jagannātha. The etiquette is nice. Everything should be offered to the, through the spiritual master. That is the etiquette. No direct. (Prabhupāda chants the second chapter of First Canto.) One chapter. Just play it. [break] ...have the sound only. (Laughs) The explanation... I shall give you little explanation."
Gargamuni,"Isn't the sound, though, as good as the explanation?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Hearing is always good.
Gargamuni,"Although we don't know what it means, but just the sound.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. Sound will act. Just like ""Kṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa,"" is acting, similarly."
Gargamuni,"What chapter is this, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda," This is second chapter, First Canto.SūtaGosvāmī, before speaking to the audience, he is offering his respect to the spiritual master. To offer respect to anyone means to remember his qualification. Just like we sing... Just like you offer respect to your spiritual master. What is the meaning?"
Gargamuni,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Through.Nārāyaṇaṁnamaskṛtyanaraṁcaiva narottamam[SB1.2.4].Yes.
Gargamuni,"Oh, that's his master.",Prabhupāda," Thank you very much.Naraṁcaiva narottamamdevīṁsarasvatīṁ.Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning. AndVyāsam,and then Vyāsadeva, who is the master of Vedic literature. One after another. This is...Vyāsaṁtatojayaṁudīrayet.Then he is... He was questioned by the audience that what is the most important religion in this age? That was their question. There are many types of religious principles. So what is the best one for this age? So he is replying that question.Munayaḥsādhupṛṣṭo 'haṁ bhavadbhirloka-maṇgalam[SB1.2.5].""You have put very nice question, because you have put the question that 'What is the best religion for the people of this age?' ""Yat-kṛtaḥkṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmāsuprasīdati.""And you have, you are very much anxious to understand the activities of LordKṛṣṇa. It is very nice. By this discussion everyone will become actually peaceful and satisfied."" So the answer, ""What is the best religious principle?"" He is answering.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo yato bhaktiradhokṣaje[SB1.2.6].""My dearbrāhmaṇas...""in that meeting all the audience were great learned sages andbrāhmaṇas.So he is addressing them. That is the best form of religion which performing one becomes elevated to devotional service of the Lord. Not religious formalities. One has to test by the result.Phalenaparicīyate.You are Christian, I amHindu, or he is Mohammedan. That's all right. You are very good, I am very good, he is very good. But what is the result of your following religion? Have you attained love of God? Simply I go the church, I go to temple, and I do all kinds of nonsense, I have no love for God, I have love for mymāyāand I go simply..., that is useless. Religious principle means... It doesn't matter whether you areHinduor Christian or Muslim or anything. It doesn't matter. Just seeBhāgavata.Savaipuṁsāṁparo dharmo [SB1.2.6].That sort of religion is nice, best, by which you can develop love of Godhead. It doesn't mention that ""This religion is best, that religion is best."" That religion is best which helps someone, the religionist, to develop love of God, Godhead. If you put to test all kinds of religion in this formula ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,you'll understand which religion is best. You haven't got to ask anybody. Simply by testing how much one has developed love of Godhead. How much one has learned to loveKṛṣṇaor God. If, following any type of religion, if you get this result, then you have performed your religious principle very nicely. This is the answer. And what kind of love?Ahaitukī,without any cause. ""Oh, I love God because I want something from Him."" Generally, as they love God, distress, they want something. ""My dear Lord, I am very unhappy. Please help me."" That is also good. That is not bad. That is accepted inBhagavad-gītā.But that is not pure love. Pure love means there is no reason. ""Why I am lovingKṛṣṇa? Oh, there is no reason. I loveKṛṣṇa. I wantKṛṣṇa."" This is love. Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhusays... You have got this translation in my first book, that, thatAdvaitahas quoted thatślokain his sermon.(?) ""Whatever you do, You are my Lord. I don't mind whether You put me into distress or You put me into happiness. Or if You don't help me in realizing You. It doesn't matter. Still, I love You. Whether I am going to hell or heaven, it doesn't matter. But I love You."" Just like Cowper said, ""England, with all thy fault, I love you."" This is love. This is material, crude.Ahaitukīapratihatā.Apratihatāmeans that business, ""I loveKṛṣṇa,"" cannot be stopped. ""I could not loveKṛṣṇabecause I was busy in doing this thing or that thing, or because..."" So many reason we can put forward. No. Love ofKṛṣṇacannot be stopped by any material reason. That is love. Nobody can say that ""For this reason I could not loveKṛṣṇa."" There is no reason. There is no impediment for anyone. Any circumstances. So any religious principle which helps a person to loveKṛṣṇaand God, in that way, without any reason, without any impediment... Just like flow of the river. There is no impediment in this world which can stop the flow of the river. Or the waves of the Pacific Ocean. There is no power in the material world which can stop the waves going on, going on, going on. You see? Similarly, that is the best type of religion. Now just see howBhāgavatais liberal in the description of religion. Religion... You are religious, you are very pious man—how it will be tested? How much you have developed love of God. That's all. Without any reason, without any impediment. This is test of best religion.Vāsudeve...(aside:)Gurudāsa, you can hear? Yes."
Gargamuni,Thank you for chantingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.,Prabhupāda, Śrīmad-bhāgavatamamalaṁpurāṇam.You have gotŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Read very carefully. All these things are already explained there. Cut it into pieces and distribute.
Devotee,Swamiji? Should we read just one chapter a day or...,Prabhupāda, It is very nice if you read one chapterBhāgavatamdaily. It is very nice. You make it a point to read one chapter daily. That is very nice.
Devotee,No more?,Prabhupāda," No, if you can do more, that's all right. Just like I ask everybody to chant 16 rounds. But if you can chant 1600 rounds, then who prohibits you? You can do that. But we should make a regulation of our life, that ""So many times I chant. One chapter I shall read. I shall go to the temple at this time."" In this way we must have routine work. Then we'll get practiced automatically. Yes. And Gosvāmīs, the Six Gosvāmīs, they were following routine work. Even they...Sāṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.They were doing regularly counting. Just like you are counting sixteen rounds. Not only chanting in that counting, but they were offering obeisances also by counting, that ""Hundred times I shall offer my obeisances."" You see? This is regular routine. Yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Swamiji, can you tell me about what you said, going through the spiritual master, not directly toKṛṣṇa, through the spiritual master.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Can you just tell me something about it?,Prabhupāda," Spiritual master is the representative of God, orKṛṣṇa. Just like if you work in some office, so there is one head man, representative of the proprietor of the company. You have to work under him. If you satisfy that person who is in charge of that department, that means you are satisfying the proprietor of the company. Is it clear? And he can give you direction how to work nicely because he's experienced. The boss. So spiritual master is external manifestation of God. God is within and without. Within, He is Supersoul. He will give you... If you are sincere, He will give you good counsel, ""You do like this."" You'll get dictation from within. That requires advancement of spiritual life. Then you get from within dictation. So God is helping from within and without. Within, asParamātmā, and without as spiritual master. Both ways. As soon as you are sincere, then God will send you to somebody who is Hisbona fidespiritual representative. And if you take help from him, and help within and without... Just like a person going, or a boy going to a school, he's getting training in the school as well as home, both sides. Then his chance is very good. So we have to take both wise: from inside, from outside. You are doing some things in the service of the Lord. How you'll know that you are doing it properly or improperly? This you will know from the spiritual master. If he says, ""It is all right,"" then it is all right. If he says, ""It is not good,"" then it is not good. Just like the same way. The officer in charge, if he is satisfied (with) your work, that means you have satisfied the government or the supreme company, arranger, with whom you have no direct connection.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādo **.Therefore it is said that if you satisfy your spiritual master, that means you have satisfiedKṛṣṇa. Andyasyaprasādādnagatiḥkuto 'pi.And if you have not satisfied your spiritual master, then you must know that you are, what is called, there is no certainty about your whereabouts, what you are doing.Nagatiḥkuto 'pi.Therefore,dhyāyanstuvaṁstasyayaśastri-sandhyaṁvandeguroḥśrī-caraṇāravindam.So spiritual master is necessary and his direction is necessary. That is the system of disciple succession. In theBhagavad-gītāalso,Arjunais surrendering. He was Kṛṣṇa's friend. Why he surrendered himself, ""I am your disciple."" You see in theBhagavad-gītā.He had no necessity. He was personal friend, talking, sitting, eating together. Still, he acceptedKṛṣṇaas spiritual master. So that is the way. There is a system to understand. It is specifically mentioned,śiṣyaste'ham.""I am your disciple now.""Śiṣyaste'haṁśādhimāṁprapannam[Bg.2.7].""You kindly instruct me."" And then He began teachingBhagavad-gītā.Unless one becomes aśiṣya,or disciple, it is prohibited, not to instruct. Not to inst... That instruction is useless. That is the system. We are instructing in the class because there are few disciples who have taken vow to learn from me. Otherwise, I have no business to teach the public. The public may come. But actual interest is to teach my disciples. But that is secondary. For the public, secondary. But real business is to teach the disciples. Just likeŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamwas meant forParīkṣitMahārāja, Śukadeva Gosvāmī's disciple. But there were many others present. They also heard. Yes?"
Gargamuni,"Well, how can we begin to serve you so that you'll be pleased?",Prabhupāda, (laughs) That I shall tell you later on. (laughter) Do you think I am not pleased?
Gargamuni,I don't know.,Prabhupāda," Oh, you must know it. How can you say that I am not pleased? How you know it that I am not pleased?"
Gargamuni,"Well, we cause you so much anxiety and everything.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Gargamuni,We cause you so much anxiety due to our faults.,Prabhupāda," Therefore I am pleased with you. Why I have given up all my anxieties of the sons and daughters who is born from my body, and why I am taking and transferring... (end)"
Girl,I didn't check. I just poured it in.,Prabhupāda, You check after giving it? This is not...
Girl,How can I distin...?,Prabhupāda, How is that? Eh?
Girl,I didn't know.,Prabhupāda, Yes?
Girl,It's my fault because I wasn't conscious of what I was doing.,Prabhupāda, It is your fault but is it grievous fault that you put something instead of something?
Girl,What can I do?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Girl,What can I do now?,Prabhupāda, How it was done? What is that thing you put?
Girl,Salt.,Prabhupāda, Salt?
Girl,Yes. It tastes like it.,Prabhupāda," Tastes like. You know that it is..., that was salt?"
Girl,"Well, I didn't know.",Prabhupāda, So somebody responsible should be in charge. That way instead of salt something may be put. So many people cooking is going on. All right.HareKṛṣṇa. (end)
Mr.Murti,(inaudible),Prabhupāda, Thank you. (chuckling) So any particular question?
Rukmiṇī,On the picture today that you gave Jadurani a picture of ŚrīViṣṇu. There is a foot on His chest. We didn't know what that was... there was a little footprint.,Prabhupāda," There are some special marks on the chest ofViṣṇuby which inVaikuṇṭhaHe is known that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise, inVaikuṇṭha, everyone has got the same feature likeViṣṇu. Just like if President Johnson comes here as a gentleman, you'll not, nobody will recognize him whether he's president or not unless he shows his special mark. Is it not? All government officers, big officers, they have got within the coat one, some mark. So far I know. So similarly, inVaikuṇṭhathe inhabitants, they gotsvarūpa.Their form is exactly likeViṣṇu. There is no difference. When the Viṣṇudūta came to takeAjamilafrom the hands ofYamadūta. They were four-handed withśankha-cakra-gadā-padmaasViṣṇu, the lotus flower, this disc, and the club, and the conchshell. There is no difference in the body. Simply by that special mark, some special hair on the chest and there isBhṛgu, I mean to say, sole, sole, a mark of the feet ofBhṛguMuni. So by some special marks one can recognize He isViṣṇu. Otherwise, from bodily features and from dress and from ornaments, there is no distinction betweenViṣṇuand His devotees inVaikuṇṭha. They're all four-handed.Svarūpasāyujyasālokyasārṣṭi.They have got equal, I mean to say, situation of prosperity, wealthy, equally, almost equally powerful. So practically there is no difference betweenViṣṇuandViṣṇu-bhakta. In Kṛṣṇaloka also. OnlyKṛṣṇais little blackish. Otherwise there is no... In the Kṛṣṇaloka they are two-handed, and Viṣṇuloka they are four-handed. All the Vaikuṇṭhas, the residents, they are four-handed. You want four-hand or two-hand? (laughter) Mr.Murti? What do you want? Four hands?"
Mr.Murti,Two hands more thanKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes. In this universe onlyBrahmāhas got four hands. Nobody within this universe. AndViṣṇualso. In thisbrahmāṇḍa,in this universe, there is a planet where the ocean is of milk. Here, just like salted water. There are many oceans. Ocean of oil, ocean of ghee, ocean of milk. The ocean of oil, you have got experience in this planet. Within the earth you are getting some... Your civilization depending, your motor car civilization is depending on that ocean of oil. You are getting oil and lavishly spending it. Stock is supplied by God. Your material advancement will be finished if the stock is not supplied by the Lord. So these foolish men, they do not know. They think that ""Without God we can live."" Who has created the ocean of petroleum within the earth? Is it possible for human being? (laughter)"
Haṁsadūta,"Someone has said that thedhotī,thedhotīthat thebrahmacārīswear, is the dress that's worn inVaikuṇṭha. Is that correct?",Prabhupāda," Just seeViṣṇu. He has no coat-pant. Here isViṣṇu. OrKṛṣṇa, He has no dress. He is alsobarebody. Only Rādhārāṇī is covered. In India also, still, the covering of the body is only for woman, but men, this, practically onedhotīis sufficient. Sometimeslaṅgota,the underwear.Laṅgota,underwear. What is that?"
Nanda-kiśora,Swami? What doesNanda-kiśoramean?,Prabhupāda," Nanda-kiśora,kiśorameans a boy."
Nanda-kiśora,Boy?,Prabhupāda, The transcendental boy ofNandaMahārāja.
Devotees,Oh!,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Madhusudana,"How is the lotus a weapon? They're all weapons. All the symbols in Viṣṇu's hand, are, all the symbols in Viṣṇu's hand are weapons. How is the lotus a weapon?",Prabhupāda," Lotus is blessing. And that disc and club is for punishing.Viṣṇuhas to see two ways because He's the Lord. So, as it is said in theBhagavad-gītā,paritrāṇāyasādhūnāṁvināśāyacaduṣkṛtām[Bg.4.8].Just like the state. State is meant for punishing the criminals and giving protection to the law-abiding citizen. Wherefrom this idea is taken? It is taken fromViṣṇu. Everything. Because He is the supreme maintainer. So everything is required for maintaining. So thisgada,the club, and the disc is for punishing the disobedient, the demons, or those who are harassing devotees. To punish them theViṣṇu-cakrais there. Just likeMahārājaAmbarīṣa, he was harassed by DurvāsāMuni, andViṣṇu-cakrapunished him sufficiently.MahārājaDurvāsā...MahārājaAmbarīṣawas a great king, but a great devotee at the same time. Because he waskṣatriyaand householder, DurvāsāMuni, he was envious. DurvāsāMuniwasbrāhmaṇaand a greatyogi. So he could not tolerate that a householder king... King is supposed to be dealing in politics, economics. Therefore, according to social position, he is lesser than thebrāhmaṇabecause they are simply engaged in the matter of transcendental advancement of life. But a devotee is above thebrāhmaṇas.That is the position of devotee. Here, the highest qualitative position is to be situated in the modes of goodness or to acquire the qualities ofbrāhmaṇa,in this material world. Truthfulness, controlling the senses, controlling the mind, simplicity and knowledge, faith in God, there are so many qualifications which makes a person as recognizedbrāhmaṇa.But a devotee, never mind whether he'sbrāhmaṇaor acaṇḍāla,he automatically develop all these qualities.Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyakiñcanā[SB5.18.12].Anyone who has unflinching devotional faith in God, he has all the good qualities. I've several times narrated the story of that hunter. He was animal killer and he used to enjoy by killing the animal half. But when he became a devotee, he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Who taught him? Nobody taught him but he was simply chantingHareKṛṣṇa. That's all. So if you actually making progress in devotional service, you are constantly in touch with the purest.Kṛṣṇais the purest.Bhagavad-gītā,it is said,paraṁbrahmaparaṁdhamapavitraṁparamaṁbhavān[Bg.10.12].""You are theparaṁbrahma,SupremeBrahman.""Brahman, every living entity isBrahmanbut He isparaṁbrahma,the leader of theBrahman. Just like the president is the first citizen of the state. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais also a living entity, but supreme living entity. Just like the first citizen. So similarly, every living entity isBrahman, butparaṁbrahmais one. That isKṛṣṇa. And therefore in theBrahma-saṁhitāit is confirmed,īśvaraḥparamaḥkrsnaḥ[Bs. 5.1].Kṛṣṇais... Everyoneīśvara,more or less controller. Lord Śiva, LordBrahmā,Indra,Varuṇa,Vāyu,Candra,Sūrya. There are so many. They're all demigods. Say, almost God. But they are not Supreme God. Supreme God is one. Sometimes people who do not know the purpose ofVedas,they say, ""The Hindus are worshiper of many gods."" That is nonsense. Actually those who are followers ofVedas,they worshipKṛṣṇa, onlyKṛṣṇaorViṣṇu.Tadviṣṇoḥparamaṁpadaṁ. Ṛgmantra.Tadviṣṇoḥparamaṁpadaṁsadāpaśyantisūrayaḥ.And in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,vedaiścasarvairahamevavedyam[Bg.15.15].What is the purpose ofVedas?To understandKṛṣṇa. One who does not understandKṛṣṇa, hisVedāntaphilosophy is nonsense. However you may advertise that ""I am Vedāntist,"" is apakkanonsense. Because he has not attained the perfection of Vedic knowledge. The perfection of Vedic knowledge is to knowKṛṣṇa, and that is also confirmed in theBhagavad-gītā:Bahūnāṁjanmanāmante[Bg.7.19].After many, many births.Jñānavān.Jñānavānmeans Vedāntist. Not... They have made it, that Vedāntist... Vedāntist, Vaiṣṇavas, they are also Vedāntist, but it has become a common sense, a common affair that the impersonalists, they are called Vedāntists. Because, due to Śaṅkarācārya's propaganda, they have made their position as Vedāntists. But common men, they do not know that the Vaiṣṇavas are the best Vedāntists. We shall discussVedāntahere also.Vedānta... InRāmānuja-bhāṣyathere is... Perhaps you know, in your country. There isRāmānuja-bhāṣyaVedānta. Madhvācārya, he has also writtenVedānta-bhāṣya.Not only Śaṅkarācārya. But because the Vaiṣṇavas, they knowbhāṣyambrahma-sūtrāṇām**. TheŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis the actual explanation ofVedānta. So therefore they take more interest inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatambecause that is the actual explanation ofVedānta. Just like in theVedānta-sūtra,the, what isBrahman, Absolute Truth.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.The inquiry is, ""What isBrahman, Absolute Truth?"" TheVedānta-sūtraanswers... TheVedānta-sūtrais made like that, questions and answers like that. So answer isjanmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].""The Absolute Truth is that from whom everything is emanating."" He is the ultimate fountainhead of everything. Just now we tried to explain that the state functions protecting the good citizens and punishing the criminals. That should be the state business. Wherefrom this idea came? The law and... What is called? The law and order department or what is that?"
Devotee,Law and order.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Wherefrom the idea came to the human society unless it is there in the Absolute? How the idea comes? Therefore that law and order isViṣṇu.Janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].The idea of law and order came fromViṣṇu. How nicely explained.Janmādyasya.In two words,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].Janmameans creation, andādi,ādimeans firstjanma,thensthiti.Sthitimeans staying, maintenance. And then dissolution. So three things.Yataḥ,from where these three things are happening. That means this world is being created from that source, it is being maintained by that source, and when it is annihilated it rests in that energy, the whole energy.Pralayaṁyāntimāmikam, Bhagavad-gītā.When everything is dissolved, the energy is absorbed by the energetic. So that is Absolute Truth. SoŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamexplains that Absolute Truth.Janmādyasyayataanvayād itarataścaartheṣuabhijñaḥsvarāṭ[SB1.1.1].In theVedānta-sūtrait is simply said that ""The Absolute Truth is that which is the fountainhead of everything."" Now if fountainhead of everything, then what the Absolute Truth's nature shall be like? That is explained in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.The first thing is thatjanmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].The factor, the Absolute Truth from which everything is emanating, so that emanation includes indirect and direct manifestation. What is that indirect and direct manifestation? The direct manifestation is the spiritual world and the indirect manifestation is this material world. Indirect manifestation means it is simply a shadow of the spiritual world. Just like in the Bible also it is said the man is made after God. So you have got two hands, one head, two leg. So the mental speculation is said that these devotees, they create God according to their own feature. Because I am two-handed, and therefore I create God with two hands,Kṛṣṇa. But actually, the fact is not that. Actually, becauseKṛṣṇahas got two hands and we have got an imitation body ofKṛṣṇa, therefore we have got two hands. Because this is imitation. That we know everything, everyone. This body will not stay. Therefore it has gotjanma.Janmameans birth or creation at a certain period, and it stays, say, for fifty years or hundred years. Then dissolved, dissolution. Therefore it is imitation. Just like if you create a doll, clay doll, very nice beautiful girl. But it will... It is imitation. It is shadow of the real beautiful girl. It is created at some time and... So reality is there in the spiritual world. Therefore it is calledjanmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].The idea comes from there, but the impersonalists, due to their intelligence being very meager, they think that the Absolute Truth is without any variety, impersonal or void. They think that varieties are only in the material world, but actually, real varieties are there in the spiritual world. It is only reflection, as it is described in theBhagavad-gītā,ūrdhvamūlamadhah-śākha.Adhah-śākham.Aśvatthaṁprāhuravyayam.Aśvattha...This material creation, material manifestation is compared with a banyan tree whose root is upward. And that I have explained several times how the tree can be upwards root. That means it is reflection. Just like you stand on the riverside, the tree will be reflected on the river, on the water, as obverted. That means that is reflection. As soon as we say that this is a tree, the root of which is up, that means it is reflection. TheMāyāvādīphilosopher, they do not take account of the mathematical calculation, 380 degree. They are taking account of... 360 degree, the whole circle. They are taking account only 180 degree. And other 180 degree they're making void. But actually, the whole point is 360 degree. That is geomatrical calculation. If you simply know 180 degree, then the other 180 degree is unknown to you. So real life, real variety, real beauty, real knowledge, everything in reality is there in the spiritual world. It is only reflection. ThereforeBhāgavataexplains thatjanmādyasyayataḥanvayād itarataścaartheṣuabhijñaḥ[SB1.1.1].The Supreme Absolute Truth is cognizant,abhijñaḥ.Cognizant andsvarāṭ.Svarāṭmeans independent. In this way, the explanation ofBrahma-sūtrais given in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.ThereforeŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamisvaiṣṇavānāṁpriyam.Yadvaiṣṇavānāṁpriyam.Yasminparamahaṁsamekaṁparaṁjñānamjñeyate.The knowledge ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis to be understood by theparamahaṁsa,the highest perfected man,paramahaṁsa.It is not ordinary thing."
Devotee,"Swamiji, if all things here are a reflection of what is perfect in the spiritual world, then shouldn'thateand frustration and despair and prejudice also appear in the spiritual world?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,Does it?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,Then isn't that... Aren't they bad?,Prabhupāda," But that frustration has no disappointment. (laughter) That is the beauty. Just like LordCaitanyais manifesting that spiritual frustration. ""OhKṛṣṇa, I could not see You."" He's jumping on the sea in frustration. But that frustration is the highest perfection of love. Yes. Everything is there. But without inebriety. You are very intelligent boy. I thank you. Yes. Yes. There is frustration, but not this frustration. Yes. That frustration, I mean to say, enriches one's eagerness of love forKṛṣṇa. Everything is there, but without inebriety. Everything is there. Yes. Now see,Viṣṇu? Of course, inVaikuṇṭha-jagatthere is no violence. ButViṣṇuis taking the symbol of violence. Otherwise what is the meaning of this disc and club? So when He wants to be violent, He comes here asNṛsiṁha-mūrti.(laughter) And He sends some of His devotees to play violence. That is Hiraṇyakaśipu. Because there the devotees are so much in accord withKṛṣṇaandViṣṇuthat there is no question of disagreement. But violence is when this disagree-ment, atheist. Therefore sometimes a devotee is deputed in this world to play as atheist, andKṛṣṇacomes to kill him. To teach these people that ""If you become atheist, then here is disc and club for you."" But it is not possible to be displayed in theVaikuṇṭha. Otherwise, if there is no the propensity of violence... Just like there is sometimes mock fight. A father is fighting in mock with a small child, and he has become defeated. But there is pleasure. Soānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).The Lord is joyful. So there is joy in fighting also sometimes. So your question that everything is there, that is a fact. Everything is there. Otherwise if everything is not there, they cannot be manifested here because it is reflection. Just like in... Of course, this discovery is by theVaiṣṇava,GauḍīyaVaiṣṇava. Just like the love betweenRādhāandKṛṣṇa, it is calledparakiya.They are not married husband and wife. But Rādhārāṇī appears to be wife of some other gentleman. ButKṛṣṇa, from childhood, They were friends. So Radhārāṇī could not forgetKṛṣṇa. She used to come toKṛṣṇaand stand like that. That's all. And He was playing.Kiśora-Kiśorī, They were boy and girl. But there is no inebriety. Just like here the boy and girls mix and there are so many abominable things. Distressful, which is binding their material bondage. So that friendship between boy and girl is there, but without inebriety.Kṛṣṇahad so manygopīs,girlfriend, but there was no contraceptive pills. (laughter) That is the beauty. Here, the so-called love is lust. And there, that is the highest. The same thing, obverted, perverted reflection. Just like in the original tree the topmost part has come down to the down. Similarly, in the spiritual world the highest, topmost level of love,parakiya...Parakiyameans love not by marriage life, by friendship. That is there. But there is no such inebriety. It is pure. So perverted means the topmost thing has come down to the lowest. Here, thisparakiya,loving other's wife or other's husband, is most abominable, adultery. Not allowed by society, not allowed by the state. But tendency is there. Even one is married, he wants to love another's wife. Or if the girl married (s)he wants to love another husband. Why? That is there. But without inebriety. That is the beauty. So everything is there, but here, that thing is reflected, pervertedly. Therefore misunderstood. There is so many other corollaries. You see? But you must know everything, that without being in the Absolute Truth there cannot be relative manifestation. This world is relative manifestation. So these things are not to be understood in the beginning, but as the questions came we discussed something. But you must know, as theVedānta-sūtrasays,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].Everything is emanated from that Absolute Truth. That is the fountainhead of everything. We cannot manufacture anything. It is not possible. But this is shadow and that is reality. And in the shadow... Just like photograph. You find that everything in detail of your beautiful face in the photograph, but that is not reality. That's all. So you'll find everything in details, all... Or you can understand actual photograph, actual idea, actual notion of the spiritual world by scrutinizingly studying this material world. The impersonalists, they think that in the material varieties there are so many abominable inebrieties, therefore in the spiritual world all these things should be minus, void. That is their material calculation. They cannot think that in the spiritual world also there is love. Because here, in this world, the so-called love or lust is frustrated and followed by so many calamities that therefore they cannot conceive that in the spiritual world also there is love. Their idea, in one sense, is right, that how these nonsensical things can exist in the spiritual world? Therefore they make it altogether minus. No variety. Impersonal. That is less intelligence. They cannot understand that photograph is the reflection of the actual person. There is everything in detail. A movie. Actually, the same man is laughing, walking, dress, everything, but it is all false. That they cannot understand. Therefore the Vaiṣṇavas say they are less intelligent. The real understanding should be that if in the real person all these features are not present, how they can be reflected in the photograph? TheMāyāvādīsays,brahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā.Brahman, the Absolute Truth, is real truth, and this world ismithyā.Thenmithyāmeans it is a reflection or shadow.Mithyādoes not mean that it has no existence. The shadow is also existence. ThereforeVaiṣṇavaphilosophers say thatmithyāmeans temporary. Now you have got this body. This is temporary. That's the real understanding. And if I say it ismithyā,then if I kill you, then why I am punished? I can say, ""Oh, it ismithyā,it is false. So what is their fault?"" No. It is notmithyā.It is temporary. Notmithyā.Mithyāhow can it be? Because it is reflection of the reality, therefore it cannot bemithyā.Then the reality becomesmithyā.Mithyāmeans not fact. The real explanation is that this is shadow. Shadow, but the reality is in the spiritual world, and that is indicated in theVedānta-sūtra, janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].The fountainhead of all emanation. That is Absolute Truth."
Advaita,"Swamiji, last night our window was broken. Was thatmāyāstriking at us?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Advaita,Last night my window was broken. Was thatmāyāstriking?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Advaita,Kids broke the window?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Māyāis always striking. Why do you take only a window? Why do you compactmāyāin the window? He is without window, within the window.Māyāis not only, I mean to say, limited to a certain extent. The whole world ismāyā. Jaganmithyā.The whole universe ismāyā.Only that part is notmāyāwhere the chantingHareKṛṣṇais there."
Devotees,Haribol.HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, As soon as there was some slacking inHareKṛṣṇathemāyāstruck. (laughs) Yes. Yes.
Govindadāsī,Swamiji?,Prabhupāda, Yes. You are asking at the last moment. You are very much careful about time.
Govindadāsī,Oh. I didn't know.,Prabhupāda," No, you ask me."
Govindadāsī,"No, I won't ask.",Prabhupāda," No, no, no, you ask. Yes. Yes."
Govindadāsī,Could you describe Kṛṣṇa's pastimes as cowboy whenever He goes out in the morning with the cowherds boys?,Prabhupāda," Yes, you can... Because... Have you seen how the... You have no experience here in your country. Have you got any experience? But in India we have got experience how in the morning the cowboy takes some food from the mother and with the cows he goes to the field. The cows are let loose on the grazing ground. They are enjoying, and this cowboy is sometimes singing. The flute, Kṛṣṇa's flute is because He is cowboy. The cowboys still play in that flute. In India you'll find. Because the cows are let... They are doing their own work, and what this boy will do? They are playing. There are many cowherds boys, they are playing. Sometimes playing on flutes, sometimes sporting, sometimes eating. SoKṛṣṇawas exactly doing like that. All the cowboy friend went with Him.Kṛṣṇawas, of course, a very rich man's son. His father was very rich. So He used to take with Him very nice foodstuff,lugdoo, kacaurī.And other, His poor friends, they were takingcapātīs,drycapātīs.(laughs) So they were enjoying, dividing, ""Your food, my food, his food."" And sometimes there was some trouble in the forest becauseKamsawas afterKṛṣṇato kill Him. He was sending his assistants. So someasurawould come, Bakāsura,Aghāsura, andKṛṣṇawould kill. And the boys would return and narrate the story to their mother. ""Oh, my dear mother! Such and such thing happened andKṛṣṇakilled it! Very..."" (laughter) The mother will, ""Oh, yes, ourKṛṣṇais very wonderful!"" (laughter) SoKṛṣṇawas their enjoyment. That's all. The mother is speaking ofKṛṣṇa, the boy is speaking ofKṛṣṇa. So therefore they did not know anything butKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇa. Whenever there is some trouble, ""OhKṛṣṇa."" When there is fire, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇa."" That is the beauty ofVṛndāvana. Their mind is absorbed inKṛṣṇa. Not through philosophy. Not through understanding, but natural love. ""Kṛṣṇa is our village boy, our relative, our friend, our lover, our master."" Some way or other,Kṛṣṇa. That is the beauty. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī is describing the playing of the boys."
Devotees,HareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, You can take this.HareKṛṣṇa.
Devotees; Brahmānanda; Gargamuni,HareKṛṣṇa. (offer obeisances) (end); It's the capital.; Tallahassee.,Prabhupāda, Miami is the capital.
Brahmānanda,No. Miami is a big tourist city.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Janārdana; Gargamuni,"It's all tourist, the whole place.; There's an Indian fellow in theSanFrancisco temple. He comes very often. He's a student, and his name is Vinode.",Prabhupāda, Vinode.
Gargamuni,"Yes. And he helps us cookprasādam.And he cooks in the kitchen and oh, he says, ""Kṛṣṇa is my only life."" He says he was so happy to find a temple here.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Gargamuni,"He mentioned to me that he's married and that he has a child in India. And he asked, ""Oh, were you married?"" And I said, ""No. My wife was taken away."" And he came over and he hugged me. ""Oh,"" he said, ""you are so lucky."" (laughter) He hugged me. He said, ""Oh, you are so lucky.""",Prabhupāda," (chuckling) There is aTulasīdas poetry,dinkaḍākinīratkabhāginīgargarabhāginīcuṣe.Bhāginī.Tulasīdas had very good, beautiful wife, and he was very much attached to her. So the system is that after the girl is staying with her husband... Because young girls, very minor age, they were married, say, ten years, nine years, twelve years. But they're allowed to live with husband, say, after thirteen years or fourteen years, when she has attained puberty. So the system is six months father house and six months husband. In this way, going and coming. But when she is elderly she can remain continually with her ...but in the beginning... Because after all, she is girl, so she cannot tolerate the separation from father and mother. So six months here, six months... SoTulasīdas, as soon as the, his father-in-law will come to take his daughter, he won't allow. He won't allow."
Brahmānanda,"Oh, he's so attached.",Prabhupāda," Yes. ""She'll go later on. She'll go."" So he went back. The father used to..., went back. In this way, several times. Then it was agreed that the girl would go there, father's house, and the father took the girl in the morning, and in the eveningTulasīdāsawent there. (laughs) His wife chastised, ""You are so rascal fool that I have come this morning and you have, evening you are here? You have so much attachment for the skin?"" Just like husband and wife talking. That struck him very badly, and he immediately left that place and went to... Left home for good. Yes. And that was the initiation that he took up writing aboutRāma. That isTulasīdāsa's life. Just being, I mean to say, hurt by the words of wife, that ""I love her,""... Later on he understood, ""Yes, she is right. So why should I be so much attached?"" She uttered this (indistinct), ""If you have got so much attachment for this skin and bone; if you had so much attachment forRāmathen your life would have been different."" So he took it seriously. ""Why not attachment forRāma?"" So he became a great devotee ofRāma,Tulasīdas. His book,Rāma-carita-mānasa.""Thinking always ofRāma,"" that is his book. It is very famous book, and that is the only important literature in the Hindi language,Rāma-carita-mānasa.It is very popular in India. Village to village. PracticallyGītāPress has flourished simply by selling theRāma-carita-mānasaandGītā.GītāandRāma-carita-mānasa.Two books. Millions of books they print and sell, thisRāma-carita-mānasaandBhagavad-gītā.So he has written thatdinkadakini.In the daytime she is just like what is called, witches. Witch? Witch?"
Brahmānanda,"Witch, yes.",Prabhupāda, Ḍākinī.Andratkabhāginī.At night she is tigress.
Devotee; Brahmānanda,She's what?; Tigress.,Prabhupāda, Tigress. At daytime she is witches. Witch or witches?
Brahmānanda,Witch.,Prabhupāda," Witch. And at night she is tigress. So that is the nature of woman. But the world is so made that everyone is keeping such tigress. (laughs heartily)Dinkaḍākinīratkabhāginī.(Hindi) Every moment she is sucking blood. She is such a dangerous tigress. Every moment sucking blood. But (Hindi) the people, the world, people of the world has gone so crazy that each one is keeping one tigress. (laughs)"
Brahmānanda,Right in the home.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That isTulasīdāsa's remark. So in many passages of his poetry he has not done very justice to woman. And another poetry, he writes,dhol guṇārśūdranarī. Dhol guṇārśūdranarīihe sabśaśankeadhikārī.(?)Dhol guṇārpaśuśūdranarī, ihe sabśaśankeadhikārī. Dhol, dholmeans drum,mṛdaṅga. Gunar, guṇārmeans... What is called English? A fool, fool. Illiterate fool, what is one word?"
Brahmānanda,Buffoon?,Prabhupāda, Maybe buffoon. Buffoon is sometimes troublesome. Butguṇārmeans he doesn't understand very nicely.
Brahmānanda,Dullard.,Prabhupāda," Dull, dull.Dhol guṇār, dholmeans drum andguṇārmeans dull.Śūdra,and the laborer class. Three.Dhol, guṇār,śūdra,andpaśu,household animals, just like cows, dogs."
Brahmānanda,Pet.,Prabhupāda," Pet, like that.Dhol guṇārśūdrapaśuandnarī.Narimeans woman. (laughs) Just see. He has classified thenarīamongst these class,dhol, guṇār,śūdra,paśu,narī. Ihe sabśaśankeadhikārī.Sasankeadhikārīmeans all these are subjected for punishment. And what about the guest?"
Govindadāsī,"Oh, the guest? It's coming.",Prabhupāda," Sośaśankeadhikārīmeans they should be punished. (laughs) Punished means, just likedhol,when the, I mean to say, sound is not very hard, dag-dag, if you beat it on the border, then it comes to be nice tune. Similarly,paśu,animals, if you request, ""My dear dog, please do not go there."" Hut! (laughter) ""No, my dear dog."" Hut! This is the way.(?) Similarly, woman. If you become lenient, then she will be troublesome. So in India still, in villages, whenever there is some quarrel between husband wife, the husband beats and she is tamed. (laughs) In civilized society, ""Oh, you have done this?"" Immediately some criminal case. But in uncivilized society they don't care for court or civilized way of...Kicharī.(prasādambeing served)"
Rayarama,"Swamiji,Janārdanatold me that from Vedic sources, you drew some conclusion that there are different universes visible? The stars are different universes? What is that?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rayarama,So each star is a different universe.,Prabhupāda," Begin, begin. (eating) Yes. Gargamuni, you distribute thispurī."
Gargamuni,Made some curry. (everyone eating for a long time),Prabhupāda, Everything hot.
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," BeforeKṛṣṇaconsciousness, was there anypurīmanufactured here? No. (laughs)"
Gargamuni; Brahmānanda; Rāyarāma; Devotee; Gargamuni,"No. None of this.; When I first came toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, I'd only been coming I think maybe two days toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, and thenMukundahad his wedding. Oh, that hooked me. Nice wedding and nice feasting. I was hooked.; That was the day after our initiations. They initiated the night before. We had two days feasting.; I came intoSanFrancisco looking for a spiritual teacher and I came toprasādamand I never left.; I think that's what hooked all of us. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," Prasādesarva-duhkhānāṁhanir asyopajāyate.(pause) Thank you.Govindadāsīhas become very good housewife. Yes. (pause) Rāyarāma, come.Kṛṣṇabaṛo doyāmoy koribārejihvājaysva-prasād-annadilobhāi.No more. (end)"
Student (1),"My question, that one child (inaudible)...Kṛṣṇaconscious... [Break] ...I don't know...",Prabhupāda," I told you that I do not expect that everyone will beKṛṣṇaconscious. That is not possible. But if there is one moon in the sky, that is sufficient to eradicate the darkness. You don't require many stars.Ekaś candras tamohantinacatārāsahasraśaḥ.If one man understands perfectly what is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is, he can do tremendous benefit to the other people. So you are all intelligent boys and girls. You try to understand thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness philosophy with all your reason or argument. But try to understand it seriously. Don't make it a farce. That is the object of life."
Student (2),"When you've got that... (inaudible) ...Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, and then you become unconscious, and then you become conscious, and then you become unconscious. And it extended like that, backwards and forwards, for five minutes. Is that Vedic?",Prabhupāda, What is that? Unconscious? You are unconscious or you answer?
Student (2),I have read and thought that...,Prabhupāda, To become unconscious.
Student (2),"...that God, the force who made everything and more in this (inaudible)..., in making this, (inaudible)...playing agame. And you play agameby playing hide and seek. The whole point of thegameis that someone is hidden from you.",Prabhupāda, There is nothing hide and seek here. It is all open. Yes?
Student (2),"Years ago, everyone wasKṛṣṇaconscious.",Prabhupāda, Everyone was...? When?
Student (3); Student (2),"When? In the beginning.; If you sit down and you look very closely into his eyes, and you get closer and closer and closer and closer. (laughter)",Prabhupāda, What is their doubt?
Student (2),"You can go all the way, all the way, all the way, and what do you find? (laughter)",Prabhupāda, You can find. I cannot find.
Student (3),"I wanted material world, being in spiritual consciousness is to get...",Prabhupāda," Yes. We are trying that. Calling everyone, ""Come and push your conscious."" We are inviting everyone. There is no restriction. And it is very easy. Just try to dance and chant. That's all. In the treatment they are taking part. That child is taught something ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. He'll be a very good child. So it is open to everyone. There is no restriction."
Student (4),(inaudible),Prabhupāda," That I have explained, that changing our body, there are 8,400,000's of bodies. So after death, you enter in one of the bodies."
Student (4),And what happens?,Prabhupāda," As happens... As you enter the body, the happening is according to the body."
Student (4),But does this go on and on indefinitely or does it stop? Do you just keep changing bodies indefinitely or does it end?,Prabhupāda," Not indefinitely. If you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, then you haven't got to change this material body. You are transferred to the spiritual world. There is eternal body."
Student (4),Oh. Does everyone go there or only some?,Prabhupāda," It is accepted that everyone goes. But if somehow you are stubborn to remain here, how one can help? (laughter) Just like the university is open for everyone. But somebody is stubborn to go to the prison department. So how the government can help? Government does not say that ""Some selected people come to the university, and others go to the prison department."" It is open for everyone, but it is the particular mentality—one is going to the university; one is going to the prison house. That is your individual independence. That is your choice. Just like so many students, they have come here. Others have not come here. So everyone has got little independence. So everyone can go to the spiritual world if he likes. But if he does not like, he will remain here. That is his choice."
Student (5),"(inaudible)... Why do you butter, ...cheese ...?",Prabhupāda, I do not know. No. We avoid.
Student (5),(inaudible)...Is that part of the whole...?,Prabhupāda," No. There is not part only, but we discourage killing. That is in the Bible also, ""Thou shall not kill,"" but they are killing. What can be done? In the Bible, Ten Commandments, there is, ""Thou shall not kill."" But they are killing. What shall be done?"
Student (6),"Have you ever found what you believe to be your self? Have you ever found your inside, I mean, not physically or mental...",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Student (6),What...?,Prabhupāda, Yes!(laughter)
Student (6),Could you tell us what you found.,Prabhupāda," Yes. I am prepared to tell you, and this center is open for telling you. Our books are there. It is not a paltry subject that you can understand immediately, but I can give you one instance. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā."
Student (7),Do you use your body when you speak?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not?
Student (7),Tell me. You said (inaudible)... that I am the soul that enters the body... (inaudible),Prabhupāda," Yes. I change my body. Just like if I change this apartment, does it mean I shall stop speaking? Similarly, if I change this apartment of body, does it mean that I shall stop speaking? That's right. (laughter) All right. Let us now chantHareKṛṣṇa. (The recording of the recording ends here-tape is turned off)"
Devotee,No.,Prabhupāda, Just see. (end)
Devotee (1) (woman),Yes.,Prabhupāda, You are feeling all right? Satsvarūpa?
Satsvarūpa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes. You did not go to the airport?
Satsvarūpa,No. I gave the lecture that was cancelled at...,Prabhupāda, Oh. Lecture?
Satsvarūpa,"You were supposed to give a lecture today, but because you gave a lecture last night in Buffalo, we cancelled it and I went instead.",Prabhupāda," So you lectured there? That's nice. Now you have to lecture. I will have to retire. (chuckles) I want that all my students now should be prepared.Puruṣottama, you sit down. You are standing. You come here. Sit down. When, at present, when we speak of past, present, future, we refer to this particular creation of my body. Is it not? Similarly, ""never return back."" ""Never return back"" means... What is your question? I... missing point. Whose question it...? Yes."
Devotee (1),"What is the question? That if we've never been withKṛṣṇa, if we've never been in Kṛṣṇaloka, then how is it that we start remembering His pastimes and His form?",Prabhupāda, You remember Kṛṣṇa's pastimes by hearingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.You can hear Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. That you can remember.
Devotee (1),But how can we remember if we've never known them before?,Prabhupāda, How you can remember?
Devotee (1),If we haven't known it.,Prabhupāda," You can know it by hearing fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Why we are citing so many scriptures,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā?Just to remember."
Devotee (1),Just to remember?,Prabhupāda," Something you forget, but I tell you repeatedly, you hear; you remember. Is it not? Here something you have forgotten completely, and I remind you constantly. Then don't you remember?"
Devotee (1),Yes. But I don't understand how is it that we forgot it... How can we remember...,Prabhupāda," Forgot, you forgot. That is your nature. You forget so many things. You cannot remember what you were doing exactly at this time yesterday. Can you remember immediately? Forgetfulness is our nature. We are very minute; therefore our..., we are subjected to the quality of forgetfulness. Just likeArjuna.Arjunawas askingKṛṣṇathat ""How I can believe that you told this philosophy ofBhagavad-gītātoVivasvān?"" He said that ""In... I, first of all, I told toVivasvān."" So in reply to that question,Kṛṣṇasaid that ""Both you and I had many, many births before, but you have forgotten; I remember."" That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and ourself. He does not forget. He remembers everything, past, present, future, all, but we forget. That is the difference between God and living entity. We are subjected to forgetfulness. So we forget; again, if it is reminded, we remind. That is our nature. So at the present moment we are forgetful of our eternal relationship withKṛṣṇa. And then, by good association, by constant chanting, hearing, remembering, we again revoke our old consciousness. That is calledKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So forgetfulness is not wonderful. It is natural. We forget. But if we keep constant touch, we may not forget. Therefore this association ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, devotees, and constant repetition of the chanting, scripture, that will keep us intact without forgetting.Satataṁkirtayantomāṁyatantaścadṛḍha-vratāḥ[Bg.9.14].We have to continue this service constantly. Then we shall not forget. Forgetfulness is not wonderful. That is our nature. That is our nature. And that is the difference between ourself and God. God does not forget. We forget. We are claiming, some of us, foolishly claiming, that ""I am God, but I forget."" God does not forget. Therefore I am not God. Is that clear? That is the difference between livingjīvaand Śiva, God. He does not forget. In theBhagavad-gītāHe says,vedāhaṁ samatītāni:[Bg.7.26] ""I know everything of this present, past, future, everything."" But we do not know. We have forgotten. In our daily life, in our childhood, so many things we did. We don't remember. But our parents may remember that as a child, that we did this. So forgetfulness is our nature. But if we keep constant touch withKṛṣṇa, then He will give us remembrance. Sosarvasyacāhaṁhṛdisanniviṣṭo[Bg.15.15].Kṛṣṇasays in the Fifteenth Chapter. Now you readBhagavad-gītāvery carefully. In our examination next January... Yes. FromBhagavad-gītāfor title ofbhakti-śāstrī.Now we have to make our organization regularly a spiritual institution so that we may be recognized, and our students may be freed from this draft board requisition. That I am... Next step is going on. [Break]Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.Puruṣottama? Why don't you get that tape? Yes."
Puruṣottama,Oh.,Prabhupāda," Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyatenatasyasamādhikaścadṛśyate.This is fromUpaniṣad.Parasyasaktir vividhaivasruyatesvabhaviki-jnana-bala-kriyaca[Cc.Madhya13.65, purport].It is said that nobody is seeing... This is called research. You are accepting any nonsense as God, and they do not have any information from the..., that God meansnatasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyatenatasyasamādhikaścadṛśyate:""God has nothing to do, no responsibility. Nobody is found greater than Him."" So if this Vedic injunction is followed, if somebody is claiming, ""I am God,"" we have to see whether he has nothing to do and whether nobody is greater than him. And these two tests will make him false immediately. He has to prove that nobody is greater than... Even contemporary... Suppose I am claiming I am God. So I have to show that at the present moment, throughout the whole world, apart from universe, nobody is greater than me. Then I am... Will these pretenders be able to show that nobody is greater than him? This is a simple test. Andnatasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate:""And he has nothing to do."" There are so many things to test who is God.Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇaḥ.Nobody shall be richer than him; nobody shall be stronger than him; nobody shall be wiser than him; nobody shall be beautiful than him. So these things have to be tested, whether he is God. And simply if I claim, ""Oh, I am God,"" there will... No testament? If I say, ""I am President Nixon,"" will you accept it? If you don't accept it, even an ordinary President Nixon, without testing his credentials, how you will accept a false man as God without testing? You must know what is that test. Credential. He must present credential. Just like when some ambassador comes to a foreign country, there is a ceremony that that ambassador must be recognized by the governor or the governor-general in that state, and he has to place his credentials, similarly, anybody is claiming as God, he has to place his credentials. And what is that credential? The test is there in theUpaniṣad,in theBhagavad-gītāand so many, all literatures,Brahma-saṁhitā,Vedānta-sūtra, inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.InŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamfirst it is said,janmādyasyayataḥ, anvayād itarataś cārtheṣvabhijñaḥsvarāṭ[SB1.1.1].Svarāṭ,svarāṭmeans fully independent.Satyaṁparaṁdhīmahi.The Supreme Truth, fully independent. We are not fully independent. And just now, if I feel a little toothache, I will have to go to a doctor. So how can I claim that I am God? God's first qualification is fully independent,svarāṭ.Abhijñaḥ.Abhijñaḥmeans fully cognizant of everything. What is that?"
Puruṣottama,Lugdoos.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. All right. Take. Distribute little.Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.Just likeKṛṣṇa. He is the Lord, but He has nothing to do. He is simply enjoying with His friends, with Radharani, with cowherds boy, withgopīs.That is greatness. He has nothing to think, ""How to provide?"" (chuckles) That is greatness. He is taking the cows as a sporting. You see? And when He was called for killingKaṁsa, He left everything, renounced everything.Aiśvaryasamagrasyayaśasaḥ...Everything in full, so much love, so much everything, but at once, in a moment, He renounced everything, went to..., leftVṛndāvana, and all these devotees, they began to cry forKṛṣṇafor the rest of life. And wheneverKṛṣṇawas reminded, oh, He will say, ""I am very soon coming. Don't worry. I am very soon coming."" (chuckles) You see?"
Girl,"Have took, Your Grace?",Prabhupāda, Yes. I have taken. You take. You know how to make lugdoo? Himavatī is good. (chuckles) She learned many things about... We have got another nice girl in Buffalo. I have given her name... What is?Sadā?
Pradyumna,Sadānandinī.,Prabhupāda," A very nice girl. Yes. Always chanting and dancing and always jolly. (chuckling) Very nice girl. You know her? No. She has recently joined. She is good devotee, good worker, very nice. SoKṛṣṇaconsciousness is so nice. Anyone who comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness immediately becomes beautiful in every respect. [Break]"
Haṁsadūta,Puruṣottama.,Prabhupāda, How manyrosetrees Jayānanda has...
Puruṣottama,108.,Prabhupāda," 108. So at least 108 flowers we'll have daily. Yes. So it is very nice. Our Hawaii,tulasigrows very nice."
Haṁsadūta,Hawaii. They have a new place?,Prabhupāda," Yes, the place where nowGovindadāsīis staying, a very nice place, just on the seaside. And the house is two stories, entire house among the fig trees. There is nice arrangement. So you have any correspondence with her?"
Jadurāṇī,A little.,Prabhupāda, So what does she say?
Jadurāṇī,"She said the flowers weren't out yet, but that was months ago. We have some mail for you. One letter is from her with up-to-date news.",Prabhupāda," Oh. Some devotees are coming. And in Honolulu, two boys, they are also doing. In Hawaii there are two branches now. Yes. One at Honolulu, one at Kauai. Kauai. That island's name is Oahu. Hawaii has five islands' stretch, and this is called Oahu. Oahu island, one side, Honolulu, and one side... This island means hill. And the valley of the hills are utilized for residential purposes. So all sides, Pacific Ocean. And there is ample production of sugar cane and pineapple. I was chewing sugar cane as it is. Yes. And there is so many coconut trees, palm trees, and mango. In mango season they throw away mangos. So I have askedGovindadāsīthat ""You make mango pulp and dry it and send it."" So they are doing nice, husband and wife, Gaurasundara, yes, trying their best. I do not know whether they are working now."
Himāvatī,Govindadāsīis working.,Prabhupāda, Working. She can work. She can earn $400 at least.
Haṁsadūta,Typing?,Prabhupāda, Yes. She is good typist.
Haṁsadūta,"We have one boy in Montreal. He says that he wants to go to Florida the first of May. His father is a real estate man. So he wants to get a job and then get a temple, and he wants someone to come there. He said me preferably.",Prabhupāda," All right. This South, North Carolina, they are also doing... (laughs)"
Haṁsadūta,He wants to go to Palm Beach. Palm Beach is the richest place in the country.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. That's all right. So chantHareKṛṣṇaand everything will be all right. And Buffalo is also doing nice. Oh, yes. The students are educated circle. They are taking interest, both the boys and girls. And three meetings I attended. Every meeting was full, two hundred boys and girls. They were dancing, chanting, asking very intelligent questions. And Rūpānuga is holding class. There will be some examination of the students. They accept papers. Yes. Some Indians are coming from long distance. One Indian gentleman, he came to see me from, what is that place? Ninety-two miles away from Buffalo."
Himāvatī,Did you see Nauvanī?,Prabhupāda, Nauvanī is there. Yes. He is there still. He is also very good. He works very nice in the temple.
Haṁsadūta,Every day.,Prabhupāda," He's a very good man. Everyone who will come to thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness will become good man, even he's a bad man. That is the influence ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Sarvairgunaiḥtatrasamāsatesuraḥ.All godly qualities will develop inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is the test. Now, our students, nobody can compare with their behavior, with their character, with their innocence. Everything nicer. So don't worry. Simply go on chanting. Everything will be all right. Don't worry."
Jadurāṇī,Doesn't sound like you're concerned about temple affairs.,Prabhupāda," No. It... That's all right. For the time being you don't touch. You chant and everything will be... Soon you will be in good health. Then you will again work. Yes. Śāradīyā, you are painting? No. All right, you finish your school. You are going to school?"
Śāradīyā,Yes.,Prabhupāda," That's nice. You are painting? That's nice. You? That's nice. Practice painting nicely. We'll require so many pictures. We shall publish so many pictures, book. You are not painting. You have no time to paint. You have got enough engagement. So you can... So long you are here, you just show how to Deity worship, how you are doing that, and they will learn. Yes. She is doing that very nice. So you can, all of you, all girls, you take, her. See doing, how she is doing. Who is doing your temple worship?"
Haṁsadūta,Are you going to give some more instruction?,Prabhupāda, No. This is... In this age temple worship is not recommended.
Haṁsadūta,It's not recommended. But Deity worship is temple worship?,Prabhupāda," It is Deity worship. Because nobody can actually, very nicely perform, this age is not suitable. You see? Temple worship, the regulation, the engagement—at least four, five men must always be engaged, always, twenty-four hours."
Haṁsadūta,In the temple worship. In the temple.,Prabhupāda," Yes. We haven't got sufficient men, neither we can arrange such a way. Besides that, your previous culture, everything is completely different. So in this ageCaitanyaMahāprabhuhas..., thissaṅkīrtana,HareKṛṣṇa,harernāmaharernāmaharernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21].This is all round. But at the same time, if you can perform as far as possible, that's nice, Deity worship. In this age Deity worship is secondary.Saṅkīrtanais primary."
Haṁsadūta,Does it matter who performs the Deity worship? Does it matter? I mean is it some particular person?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. That is calledarcana-siddhi."
Haṁsadūta,"Who should do it? I mean, in the temple who should do it?",Prabhupāda," No, everyone should do it. Yes, everyone should learn. Everyone should learn. Sometimes somebody is doing something, somebody is doing something. Yes, like that. Everyone should be expert in every respect, twenty-six qualifications. (car noise outside) You have got car here? No. Nobody has got car amongst our disciples?"
Jadurāṇī; Himavatī,"No.; Do you need a car, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda," No, because the temple is here, just in front. So what is the use of car?"
Satsvarūpa,"Prabhupāda, I found a place very likely for a new temple. And I've gone so far as... The lawyer even drew up a lease. So maybe tomorrow you could look at it.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. What is the description?"
Satsvarūpa,"Very excellent location, right downtown. The things wrong with it is that the temple area is no bigger than the temple area we have now, but the location is just the greatest. Second floor. Still, right downtown.",Prabhupāda, Second floor. So what is the rent?
Satsvarūpa,"Three hundred a month. But we can do it as long as... Presently,Patita-pāvanais working and so am I, and sometimes thegopīsget some money. So we wouldn't have any problem as long asPatita-pāvanawould continue to work.",Prabhupāda," All right,Kṛṣṇawill solve the problems. But the space is not lesser than this temple?"
Satsvarūpa,"Well, the temple room is maybe even smaller than the present temple room, but then there's another large, very large room for a kitchen and then another space where bunks could be for sleeping. So there's actually three different spaces. The thing is that the main temple hall is not too large.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. That doesn't matter. You have to takesaṅkīrtanaparty. That should be the main business. And the..., at least sixteen men, fourmṛdaṅgas.Practicemṛdaṅgalike that. And twelve cymbals, and one chanting and all others responding. Oh, it will be tremendous. Take some flags, ""ISKCON,HareKṛṣṇa"" flag, red flag. You see? And conchshell,mṛdaṅga.In New York they are doing now, and they also one day collected 240 dollars or something like that. What is that?"
Puruṣottama,247.,Prabhupāda, 247. You see? (chuckles)
Haṁsadūta,"I'll try in Montreal. We have new devotees now, lot of new boys.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Oh, you will get devotees. You just beginsaṅkīrtanaparty. You will get many devotees. You see? In Los Angeles, daily the devotees, new devotees, are coming, and very nice boys. We are now searching after a bigger place. Yes. That temple is not sufficient, although that is the biggest center of all our centers. It has got compound. It has got parking place. It has got two big halls, one big room, one big kitchen, and three, four, five small rooms. It is a nice situation, you see, just suitable for our purpose. And they decorateJagannāthavery nicely. Yes. So increase centers. And what is the name of the boy who went to...Nanda-rūpa(?). He wants to open Toronto?"
Haṁsadūta,In Toronto. Toronto is a very good place to go.,Prabhupāda, So let him open.
Haṁsadūta,Let him go?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,"Okay. But not alone. He needs someone else, I think. He needs one more boy. I don't think by himself he can do it.",Prabhupāda," That we shall arrange, somebody to go. Yes."
Haṁsadūta,Maybe you remember Mr. Sini(?) in Montreal?,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Haṁsadūta,"Well, he approached me just recently. He wants to open a store, Indian store and goods, and he wants the boys in the temple to work there. He wants to make some arrangement so the temple will get some money.",Prabhupāda, He is very cunning man.
Haṁsadūta,"Yes, I know. I don't trust him at all.",Prabhupāda, He wants to utilize our men.
Haṁsadūta,"Yes. Don't deal with him, right? That's what I thought.",Prabhupāda," He wants a cheap, cheap price. [Break] I don't believe all these things they have... They have come here to beg, to make money. You see? Their mentality cannot be good."
Haṁsadūta,I have a letter for you fromGopālaKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, Oh.GopālaKṛṣṇais a good boy.
Haṁsadūta,"Oh, he's very nice. Oh, he's getting so nice. He wants to come.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. Because he is serving.
Himavatī; Haṁsadūta,"He lives in our house now.; He lives with us now. You know we have another house, the whole house, and almost everyone now is a devotee there. And they're eatingprasādam.",Prabhupāda," GopālaKṛṣṇais very nice boy. You give him good protection, and he will turn very good help.Sevonmukhe...ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness can be, I mean to say, appreciated only by service. There is no other, no other way.Sevonmukhehijihvādau[Brs. 1.2.234].You cannot catchKṛṣṇaby any way, by your riches, by your beauty, by your..., because He excels everything. How you can make Him under your control? You can simply make Him under your control by service, like thegopīsdid. Yes. What is this?Prasāda?Oh, I think I cannot take any. All right, I shall take some."
Satsvarūpa,The devotees haveprasādamover at the temple that's ready.,Prabhupāda," Oh, they can take. They can go. [Break]... initiated, they are chantingmantrasthree times,oṁbhūrbhuvaḥsaviturvareṇyam?Yes. (devotees chantingjapa)"
Haṁsadūta,What are they called?,Prabhupāda," It costs not much with single... (Someone turns on tape of chanting) Oh, the... Middle. Middle. What is this? Tune? Tune? No, what is called?"
Satsvarūpa,Speed.,Prabhupāda," Speed. Yes. That's all right. Oh, so many things. This is the rest of..."
Haṁsadūta,Conchshell.,Prabhupāda, Is it broken?
Haṁsadūta,"A little bit. What is this for, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda, Thispancapātra.
Haṁsadūta,What do you put in there? Ghee?,Prabhupāda, No. Water.Ācamana.And what is this?
Himāvatī,Look inside.,Prabhupāda, Jagannātha?
Himāvatī; MissRose,Yes. (end); It's not in good order Swamiji.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
MissRose,It's not in good order.,Prabhupāda, Which order?
MissRose,"Well, my house where I live.",Prabhupāda," No, no. I say that you purchase one house."
MissRose,Participate in one house?,Prabhupāda, Purchase.
Devotee; MissRose,Purchase. Buy.; Oh. Am I gonnadiggold?,Prabhupāda," Oh, you have no money?"
MissRose,To buy a house? I wish I did. I'd take all of the disciples and put 'em all in one house.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You just make one down payment, and they will pay monthly."
MissRose,Kṛṣṇa!,Prabhupāda, Yes.Kṛṣṇawill help you.
MissRose; Candanācārya; MissRose; Candanācārya,Kṛṣṇa!; Sell your car!; I've got a bad back. I can't walk.; Your car helps your back?,Prabhupāda," Oh, your car is so nice. If I would have remained here, I would ask you to donate this car to the society."
MissRose,Can never tell what I do for (Prabhupāda chuckling) all my sisters and my brothers.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
MissRose,"These are all my sisters and brothers, Swamiji. Right?",Prabhupāda, Yes. certainly. So don't worry.Kṛṣṇawill give you better place.
Satsvarūpa,"That was a disappointment because we almost, almost had it.",Prabhupāda," Yes. No question of disappointment. In Los Angeles, we had so many disappointments. At last, we got very nice place. Now we are after bigger place."
Candanācārya; MissRose,Tell Swamiji about the church we want to get.; The church...?,Prabhupāda, Then that article has worked adversely?
Satsvarūpa,"Yeah. The real estate man said if it had only come out a week later, he said, ""You'd be in.""",Prabhupāda," So publicity like this is not good for us, that people are thinking we are hippies."
MissRose,"Yes. That's true, Swamiji. Yeah.",Prabhupāda," So then you should not give publicity. You must even in the beginning verify that we are not hippies.HareKṛṣṇamovement is not for hippies. In many places this is a notion, that we are hippies."
Devotee,Montreal.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee; MissRose,"Montreal too, the same thing.; Yes, but a lot of hippies have gone back to... They've went to Florida, Swamiji. Thousands of hippies went back to Florida. They left Boston.",Prabhupāda," They are, most of them, in Hawaii also."
MissRose,"Oh, there's some in Hawaii too?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
MissRose; Candanācārya,"Oh.; Prabhupāda, I think he was worried because... [Break]",Prabhupāda, ...all right. We don'thatehippies. We have nothing... But these people misunderstand. That is... That is another thing. We welcome everyone. We have no such distinction.
MissRose,"Oh, yes, yes. Everyone can come.",Prabhupāda, Never mind.
MissRose,Kṛṣṇa's good.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee; MissRose,Kṛṣṇawants a better place for us.; Kṛṣṇawants a better place.,Prabhupāda, (laughing) And also it is a fact that many of our students have come from the hippies.
Haṁsadūta,Almost all of them. (laughter),Prabhupāda," So they are our best candidates. So you can advertise that ""We are not hippies, but we are converting many hippies to the sane condition of life."" That's a fact. They are searching after something better, but they have no leader."
MissRose,"Yes, that's true. That's it.",Prabhupāda," They have no leader. Now, if they come to us seriously, they get the right thing. But that is also their defect. When we propose, ""Come and take thisKṛṣṇa,"" they don't want. They want that marijuana."
Candanācārya,"Prabhupāda, my mother had the idea of going to rich parents who are very anxious about their children who've become hippies and saying that this movement...",Prabhupāda," So you should write article that ""We are not hippies, but we are converting hippies to the sane condition. So father, mothers, who are anxious for their children, let them send their children to us. We take care."" In this way you make impression in the public mind."
Candanācārya,And also they make donations.,Prabhupāda, Yes. So our New Vrindaban scheme is there. Let them help and send their children. We make just opposite number of hippies. Yes.
MissRose,"Swamiji, but that has to advertised in papers...",Prabhupāda, So why don't you do it? This is a service. You can do it.
MissRose,"Yes, right.",Prabhupāda, You are acquainted with so many people. You are experienced.
MissRose,But I mean so that people can read it. So they'll understand it's not hippies.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You go to responsible men and see, that ""This is a nice movement. Why don't you patronize it to save your country's from the hippies' falling down, confusion?"" We are saving. Practically this society is giving the best service to your country. They should appreciate, but they should not misunderstand us. How we can be hippies? We completely... That is also said. How foolish man he is, that, er... In that article, Satsvarūpa, in that article, it is clearly stated that we are refusing all these things. How they conclude that we are hippies?"
Satsvarūpa,It wasn't a bad article.,Prabhupāda, Oh! What a nonsense he is!
Candanācārya,He is worried that hippies come to the ceremonies to see us.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Candanācārya,I think that's why he's worried about hippies.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Candanācārya,Because he saw photographs that audience was hippies.,Prabhupāda," Oh. So that we cannot cancel: ""These hippies are not admitted."" No. We admit everyone. We cannot say that ""Such and such person cannot enter into our temple."" We cannot say. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is welcome. And, if they do not come, how they'll converted?"
MissRose,I think that the confusion is...,Prabhupāda," We cannot say, just like, in some hotels, that ""Such and such persons are not admitted."" No. We cannot. We admit everyone. Our mission is to elevate persons from down state of life to the highest state of life. So everyone is in down state. Lord Jesus Christ also said that ""You do nothatethe sinners, buthatesin."" Is not that, Lord Jesus Christ said? So hippies may be sinners. We raise them to the pious life. But we say, ""Don't do this. Don't do this sinful act. Don't take intoxication. Don't do this. Don't do this."" Wehatesin, not the sinners. Actually. If wehatesinners, then where is the possibility of preaching?"
MissRose,"If the hippies would come, come, come...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
MissRose,Then you can get them out of this hippie into Christian conscience. See.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is our mission.
MissRose,Yes. I can understand that.,Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa. All right.Kṛṣṇawill see. So you just give service toKṛṣṇa, impressing people that theseKṛṣṇaconscious people are not hippies."
MissRose,"Oh, yes! I told a lot of people. You know, Swamiji, the first time when I heard about 95 Glenville Avenue, the first time, a woman told me that, she says, ""You know,"" she says, ""gypsies, we have neighbors, gypsies on the street."" ""Gypsies! I haven't seen any gypsies."" Well, I put my shoes. I went downstairs. I went to the door and I start reading. I says, ""This is spiritual. This is beautiful. This is spiritual."" I forgot right away. So she came to the door, Jadurani. She came to the door and she said, ""HareKṛṣṇa,"" and she said, ""Come in."" I came in and she started talking to me and that's... I got started. So when I seen her, I said, ""That's not gypsies. That's not gypsies."" And I explained it to her. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I seen the curtains in the window,"" she said, ""and I thought they were gypsies."" ""Oh, well,"" I explained it to her. ""Oh,"" I says. I let her have it, there was no gypsies there. So she used to see me coming down to got to the temple. So nice, yeah? Do you like that place, Swamiji?",Prabhupāda, Which place?
MissRose,"Where the disciples are now, on Glenville Avenue? Or do you think that you need another place?",Prabhupāda," No, sometimes the, some children disturb. They broke..."
MissRose,"No. Oh, I know they broke the windows. I know that. You know, Swamiji, it's very hard to find apartments, and, Swamiji, they're very expensive. $125, $135, $145 dollars a month, the apartments are. See. Yeah. And they're very, very hard to find. And sometimes I want to get out of there myself. Because, I mean, there is so many... It's really turning out to be kind of a bad, a lot of children there.",Prabhupāda, Let us see. AsKṛṣṇadesires. Beginkīrtana.Chant. (end)
Pradyumna,"Swamiji, I read in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamin the purport to the (inaudible)...ślokas...And I saw in another book aboutsambandha,abhidheya,(inaudible) ... Could you explain that?",Prabhupāda," That is calledprayojana.Everyone enters into contact or agreement with another. What is the idea? To achieve some profit. To get some profit. Similarly, we have got... (break—kīrtana) (end)"
