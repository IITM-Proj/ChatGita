Haṁsadūta,"No. If we get that house, Prabhupāda...",Prabhupāda, You can get.
Haṁsadūta,We can get?,Prabhupāda," Yes, why not? You have appealed to the king, and he is willing. Why can you not? What is the difficulty? Now it is your business how to induce, induce him. There is chance, ninety percent chance."
Haṁsadūta,"In which way will it be most helpful, in giving money personally or inducing others to give money? He will give money?",Prabhupāda," Yes, otherwise..."
Haṁsadūta,How much money?,Prabhupāda, Ten lakhs.
Haṁsadūta,Ten lakhs. They can give the full amount?,Prabhupāda," Yes, why not? This man... It is to be very carefully tackled. This king is going to die very soon. And as soon as the king dies, the queen's position is very precarious, almost finished. So if she becomes our president, she'll continue to keep her honor and prestige. That's a fact. She's a good lady. We have no objection to make her the president of the local center. And she is American. She will be able to tackle these American boys and girls with motherly affection. And we shall keep her always in good respect so that throughout her life she shall be honored all over as she was, as she was honored with her husband. This is a fact. So you have to convince her. And I think if the other ladies who are..., her daughter-in-law and granddaughters, like that... Because her son is dead. He was the king. This old man being invalid, his son was king. And I think that middle-aged woman was there. You have marked this? She might be her daughter-in-law and the young girls might be grandchildren. One of them, one of the daughters, girl, was very beautiful. So it appears that she comes from the royal family. Rāja - kanyā King's daughters are very beautiful. That is fabulous in India, king's daughter, rāja - kanyā . In India if anybody gets a good dowry and a beautiful wife it is said, arddhe rajatva eka rāja - kanyā (?) Actually we have seen in..., when Devaki was married to Vasudeva , how much dowry. Can anyone imagine now? So many thousands of horses, chariots, elephants, maidservants, all decorated with gold ornaments. One cannot imagine even at the present moment. Therefore they talk of ""legends."" But actually such dowries were given when a king's daughter was married. Not only royal family, even in ordinary family still, those who are rich, they spend lots of money to be married, either son's marriage or daughter's. When one spends lots of money during the marriage of one's daughter and son he is considered to be really rich man. That is the proof that he is rich man. So we can begin. He cannot rise, this, what is called, Muktananada? That's all right. Where he is?"
Devotee,"Muktananda, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Yes. You come here. Girls may sit here. You can sit comfortably on this. (Devotees come in and sit down.) What is that?
Kauśalyā,Kauśalyā : Her baby. Her child. Her son.,Prabhupāda," Oh. So we were talking of Ajamila , a brāhmaṇa resident of Kānyakubja , presently known as Kanauj. So, kānyakubje dvijaḥ kaścid asit patir..., asit kaścid dāsī -patir ajāmilaḥ , nāmnā naṣṭa -sadācāro dāsyaḥ saṁsarga - dūṣitaḥ . That, what is known as, at the present, prostitute, they were know as dāsya , dāsī . (aside:) Don't make sound, ""cut, cut."" Silent. Dāsī ... The kṣatriya kings also, when they married, with dowry many maidservants would follow the queen. That was the kṣatriya system. So Ajamila was the illegal husband of a prostitute, dāsī , dāsī - pati . Actually one should be husband of dharma - pati , religiously married, not a friend or a husband of illegal marriage. That is not allowed. Dāsī -patir ajāmilaḥ nāmnā ... Ajāmila nāmnā . His name was Ajāmila . Why the sound is in...? It is not possible to charge? ""Cut, cut cut, cut."" Naṣṭa -sadācāraḥ. Sadācāra means good behavior. Why good behavior was lost? Dāsyaḥ saṁsarga - dūṣitaḥ . Because he was associating with a prostitute, illegal sex. Therefore, anyone who wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must be sadācāra. His behavior must be very regulated. Asadācārī, unclean, nonregulated, cannot make any progress. If somebody says that ""Whatever you like, you can do. There is no difference. You can imagine your own way..."" This is going on nowadays. ""Whatever you like, you can do. You can imagine your own way of self-realization."" But that is not recommended in the Vedic literatures. One must be sadācāra. This is the beginning of sadācāra, to rise early in the morning, to cleanse, then chant, or chant the Vedic mantras or, simplified as in the present age, Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , mahā - mantra . This is the beginning of sadācāra. So sadācāra means to become freed from sinful reaction. Unless one follows the regulative principles he cannot be freed. And unless one is fully freed from sinful reaction he cannot understand what is God. Those who are not in sadācāra, regulative principles, for them... Just like animals, they are not expected to follow any... Of course, by nature they follow regulative principles. Still, but human being, having advanced consciousness, so instead of using it properly, they misuse the advanced consciousness and thus they become lower than animals. The animals, for want of advanced consciousness, cannot follow any regulative principles. But by nature they have got some regulative principle. A human being, advanced consciousness, instead of using it for advance in spiritual life they use it for sense gratification and thus they become lower than the animals. So as soon as one becomes irregulated, without any sadācāra, then he doesn't care for any sinful activities for maintaining his body and soul together. He doesn't mind. Their philosophy is, what is called? ""Existence is the first law of nature,"" or something like..."
Guest (1),Self-preservation.,Prabhupāda," Self-preservation. So self-preservation... They do not know what is self-preservation. That is another ignorance. They consider this body as the self. Their self-preservation means to keep this body. And that is also not possible. If you do not follow regulative principles, it is not possible to keep your body in good condition. That is also not possible. Those who do not follow the regulative principles, mostly they are diseased, some kind. We find in the medical, modern medical shop the customers are educated people. Mass of people, they are not customers in the medical shop. You'll find it. They are not so much diseased. In every gentleman's house, modern, you'll find so many bottles of medicine. But you won't find such medical bottles in any house of less educated persons. They are not so diseased. So this is one of the items. If you want to advance in spiritual life you must follow the regulative principles to rectify your mistakes in the past life and this present life. Without being freed from all contamination nobody can understand God. That is not possible. Bhagavad- gītā says, yeṣāṁ anta gataṁ pāpaṁ : ""One who has become completely freed from all kinds of sinful reaction,"" yeṣāṁ tv anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya - karmaṇām , ""Persons who are engaged in pious activities only,"" te , ""such person,"" te dvandva - moha - nirmuktā ... [Bg. 7.28 ]. This life, the material life, is dvandva . Dvandva means fighting or quarreling. Every one of us has got nature for fighting with others unnecessarily. Even some people come here with a spirit of fighting with me. So this is called dvandva and moha . How this fighting spirit becomes developed? On account of illusion. What is that illusion? Accepting this body as self. So if one is contaminated by sinful activity—if he is in illusion, how he can..., illusion of accepting this body as self—what is the meaning of their self-realization? He's illusioned. He'll keep himself in all kinds of contaminated life, and artificially he thinks that by some kind of mystic meditation he'll be all right. This is going on. No. One must follow. Meditation, yogic meditation, is also possible when there is yama , niyama , āsana , praṇāyāma —the eight principles of yoga system. And nobody follows the eight principles of yoga system and simply sitting down and meditating, that will not help. The first two steps are yama , niyama , then āsana , then praṇāyāma , then pratyāhāra, then dhyāna , then dhāraṇā , then samādhi . These are explained in the yogic śāstra or Bhagavad- gītā . So this man, although born of a brāhmaṇa father... Now, here it is said that naṣṭa -sadācāra. Although he is born of a brāhmaṇa father, his ācāra , his dealings for advancing in spiritual life...A brāhmaṇa is expected to be truthful, to be self-controlled, to be fully cognizant of spiritual life, practical application in life, jñānam , vijñānam , āstikyam , to have complete faith in the statement of the śāstras. That is... That is called āstikyam . We, according to our Vedic system, we do not accept any other system of religion because we consider them nāstika . That is the primary principle. Nāstika means one who does not believe in the Vedas. He is called nāstika . Not that he does not believe in God. One may believe in God, but one who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is called nāstika . Veda na manīyā bauddha haila nāstika . Lord Buddha , although he is accepted as incarnation of God, but because he defied the Vedic principles it is said, nindasi yajña -vidher ahaha śruti - jātaṁ . Lord Buddha criticized the, I mean to say, sacrificial ceremonies because in the sacrificial ceremonies sometimes there is recommendation of killing an animal. But he was preaching nonviolence. So he criticized even the sacrifice in yajña . He criticized. Nindasi... But a Vaiṣṇava is praying, ""My dear Lord, you are defying the Vedic principles."" He knows why the Lord is now defying the Vedic principles; therefore he is devotee. In spite of Lord Buddha's defying the Vedic principles, a devotee is offering him obeisances. Keśava dhṛta - buddha - śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare . He knows the Lord, how He is playing, how He is bewildering the atheistic class of men. The atheistic class of men did not believe in God. Lord Buddha says, ""Yes, you don't require to believe in God. There is no God. But you feel yourself that when you are attacked with violence you feel pain. Why should you offer to others?"" Because his mission was to stop animal killing. Sadaya - hṛdaya - darṣita - paśu -ghātam. The Supreme Lord became too much compassionate when he saw that people are unnecessarily killing animals, as it is going on still. Instead of... At least those who are claiming Buddhist, they are killing animals. Bruce, is it not? Yes. But in the Buddhist religion there is no sanction for killing animals. Yes?"
Guest (2),(Hindi),Prabhupāda," (Hindi) Muhammad, he also did not believe in the Vedic literature. But according to Vedic literature, anyone who does not believe in the Vedic literature, he is nāstika . Just like the Mohammedans, they say, ""Anyone who does not believe in Koran, he is kafir."" The Christians say, ""Anyone who does not believe in the Bible, they are heathens."" That is there everywhere. Similarly, Lord Caitanya said that veda na manīyā bauddha haila nāstika . He is giving the definition because we have to follow the great personalities, great ācāryas. That is our process. We do not make any research, or we do not make any statement made by us. We simply accept the injunctions given by great ācāryas. Ācāryopāsanam. That is the process of Vedic system. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . One must approach a spiritual master and learn from him. So whatever spiritual master says, that is accepted. Sādhu guru śāstra vākya . Real evidence is, it must be stated in the scriptures, it must be explained by the spiritual master or saintly persons. That is evidence."
Guest (3),Śastra- vākya - pramāṇa .,Prabhupāda," Śāstra- vākya - pramāṇa . And it should be known through the spiritual master. Just like nowadays Bhagavad- gītā is being interpreted in so many foolish ways because they do not accept explanation from the authority. They become themselves authorities. Therefore misused. That is not explanation. Somebody is explaining that Kurukṣetra means this body, pañca - pāṇḍava means the senses. These are all nonsense. You have to accept Bhagavad- gītā as it is. When you cannot understand, you should get it explained by your spiritual master. Therefore one has to accept a spiritual master to understand. Tad -vijnanārtham. In order to understand that transcendental science one must approach a bona fide spiritual master. That is injunction. So here it is said that kānyakubje dvijaḥ . Dvijaḥ means he was offered the sacred thread. That means he was born in a brāhmaṇa family. Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ . Everyone is born a śūdra , a foolish. Sudra means a foolish man who simply laments. That is the real meaning of śūdra . Anyone who has no intelligence, he is śūdra . We also generally say, gadāh , less intelligent. So brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, they are called higher caste . According to their... Brāhmaṇa , first-class because his intelligence is first-class. Kṣatriya , his intelligence is second-class. Vaiśya , his intelligence is third-class. And śūdra means fourth-class. And less than śūdra , they are called pañcama , caṇḍāla . They are accepted as animals, those who are less than śūdras. This is the Vedic system. Now, here it is said that this Ajamila , dvija ... Dvija means he was properly initiated, second birth. First birth by father, mother, is śūdra . Anyone, even if he is born in a brāhmaṇa family, the natural birth is considered as śūdra . But if there is garbhādhāna- saṁskāra , then he's accepted as born brāhmaṇa , born brāhmaṇa . Still, one is born brāhmaṇa , he has to undergo the saṁskāras. So our, this... Now it is known as Hindu society although the ""Hindu"" word is given by the Mohammedans. It is called sanātana - dharma or varṇāśrama society, who very strictly follow the four divisions, social divisions of varṇa — brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , vaiśya , śūdra —and four divisions of spiritual life— brahmacārī , gṛhastha , vānaprastha, and sannyāsa . So our, the Vedic system is called varṇāśrama . Varṇa means the social order. Āśrama means spiritual division. Therefore those who are following strictly the Vedic principle, that family life is called gṛhastha āśrama . Āśrama. Whenever you add this word āśrama there is spiritual significance. So all the division- brahmacārī , gṛhastha , vānaprastha, and sannyāsa —they are known as āśrama . Anyone can understand āśrama . As soon as there is āśrama that means ""Here some men, saintly persons, spiritually advanced persons, lives."" That is āśrama . So that āśrama , when a student follows the regulative principles, he is supposed to be situated in brahmacārī āśrama . A householder living with family, husband, wife, children, if they are following strictly the regulative principles— gṛhastha āśrama . Similarly, retired life, if he is following the regulative principles—the vānaprastha āśrama . Similarly, a renounced life, sannyāsa , if he is following the regulative principles, that is sannyāsa āśrama . Not that imitating somebody, I put on a saffron dress and I become a sannyāsī and by begging I live. This has killed the whole Hindu society or the sanātana - dharma society. Unqualified persons, they do not know the regulative principles but for solution of economic problem they dress themselves. This is Kali - yuga . They will pass on simply by the dress without any knowledge. So here also, although Ajamila was born of a brāhmaṇa father and he was strictly following the regulative principles of a brāhmaṇa —that will be stated—but he fell. He fell in love with a prostitute And therefore his characters were lost. Naṣṭa -sadācāraḥ. The reason is why? Dāsyāḥ saṁsarga - dūṣitaḥ . Because he associated with a prostitute, therefore his all regulative principles became lost. And as soon as you are lost of regulative principles then you take to all kinds of sinful activities. The regulative principles will keep you on the standard of life. If you give it up, then immediately you fall down, māyā . So this man Ajamila , because he was durācāra , naṣṭa -sadācāra, lost of all regulative principles on account of associating with a prostitute, then, although he was born of a brāhmaṇa family, he became... His livelihood was juha (?), bandy- akṣaiḥ , cheating and stealing. Bandy- akṣaiḥ kaitavaiś cauryaiḥ . Cauryaiḥ means stealing. Garhitāṁ vṛttim āsthitaḥ . This kind of profession is garhitā. Garhitāṁ means... Hitā means beneficial. But this profession is garhitā because it is not beneficial. Ultimately he will be punished either by the king's law or by the God's law. I can escape the king's law by doing something which is abominable but I cannot escape God's law. That is not possible. Therefore, although he is thinking that ""Now I am cheating this person,"" or ""I am stealing and getting some profit,"" that is not good for him. Just like a man is killing some man, another man. So that is not good for him because as soon as he will be arrested he'll be hanged. So they think that ""I am cheating the state, I am cheating God, and I can go on gratifying my senses by all these activities,"" but that is stated in the śāstra as garhitā. Garhitā means it is not beneficial for you."" Na sādhu mānye yato ātmano 'yam. In another place it is said, ""These kinds of activities, vikarma , is not good ultimately."" Na sādhu mānye yato ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB 5.5.4 ] . Although ātmā , the self, is different from this body—that is the first lesson in spiritual life—still, this body, although temporary, but as soon as you accept this material body you will have to suffer according to the body. If you get a dog's body you suffer according to that. If you get a man's body... Suffering will be there more or less as soon as you get this material body. Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva said, na sādhu mānye : ""You are acting abominable. It is not good because you are already suffering in this body."" Otherwise why you are stealing? You are in want of money. You are suffering. Therefore necessity is now law. Therefore you are accepting. Even you know that stealing is bad, still, you are accepting it because that is a suffering. So for some of your activities in the past life you are now suffering, and if you go on, continuing committing this nonsense, then you will again, you will have to again accept a body and you'll suffer. Therefore garhitāṁ . There are so many things to know but these things are not discussed nowadays. Very cheap thing: ""You can do whatever you like. You simply meditate and become God, that's all."" So much cheating is going on everywhere, all over the w"
Guest (4),(Hindi) Yesterday I had a talk with Bhagavati Hema .,Prabhupāda, Accha .
Guest (4),She told me to come for an interview.,Prabhupāda, Oh. So your interview is finished?
Guest (4),"I have got most of my queries and answers but they remain, some.",Prabhupāda, So you can inquire. But sometimes wrong report is published.
Guest (4),"People releases wrong report. I am a responsible man, sir.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but some irresponsible report is published in that paper, that ""Bhaktivedanta Swami says that Kṛṣṇa is everything and nothing."" That..."
Guest (4),The very reading was abominable.,Prabhupāda, That's it.
Guest; Guest (4),(unintelligible); I really couldn't believe it.,Prabhupāda," No, in the reading matter he said that, ""He was trained by his father to worship Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa , to observe Rathayātrā, and he was taught mṛdaṅga ."" These are all true. But anyone who worships Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa and who follows the Hindu ceremonies, Rathayātrā, how he can say that ""Hinduism nothing""? Just see how rascaldom. This is contradiction."
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , there is reason for that. Because that paper, the owner of that press is a Jain. And the Jains have a natural antipathy towards the ...?...",Prabhupāda," Oh, just see. So how biased man can report? So therefore we are avoiding reports."
Guest (4),(Hindi?),Prabhupāda," No, tape may be. But he also taped, that man. But he has misrepresented."
Guest (4),"I should like to ask one question, sir.",Prabhupāda," All right, you can ask. But kindly publish rightly. Don't..."
Guest (4); Guest (5),"Yes, yes.; (unintelligible)",Prabhupāda, [break] Still you want to inquire from her?
Guest (4),From the entire business.,Prabhupāda," So you can inquire from me. In my presence, you can inquire from me. Because, after all, they are my students, they may not be able to reply thoroughly. So if you have got any inquiries you can ask from me."
Guest (4),"Yes. Yes. Mahārāja , I am a teacher of Sanskrit and English in one of the higher secondary schools here and I am very much interested...",Prabhupāda," So you join us. Simply lip sympathy will not do. Just like these boys and girls, they have joined wholeheartedly. So I do not find any Indians."
Guest (4),I am ready to join but for my family liabilities. Is there is some...?,Prabhupāda," So you can join. You are family man, so it is not that we have no family men. We have got many family men. Now, they are all family. These girls, they have got a husband. And some of them, they are living separately. Just like one of my students, Professor Howard Wheeler. He is married man. He is living separately. Not separately. He is also conducting our, one establishment, New Vrindaban. So it is not that one has to live with us. He can live separately also, but his whole life is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa . That is wanted."
Guest (4),I would like to live with you and tour with you.,Prabhupāda, So why not come and live and tour with me? Who forbids you? But it is not possible to pay anything for your family expenditure. That is difficulty. We cannot pay anything but you can live with your family. That responsibility you can take. But I cannot pay you. That's not possible. Because we are maintaining by collecting alms. In that case it is not possible to pay something. There is... [break] It is selling all over Europe. (Hindi)
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , could you employ me in some...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, employ, I can employ in any way. But there is no payment."
Guest (4),"I am M.A. in English, M.A. in Hindi. I am trying to devote myself to this work...",Prabhupāda, So please come.
Guest (4),But for my family liabilities...,Prabhupāda," What amount you want for your family, minimum?"
Guest (4),Five hundred a month.,Prabhupāda," That is not possible. Yes, you require five hundred. I know that. That is not much. To maintain a family nowadays five hundred rupees is not much but where is the money? How can I pay you?"
Guest (4),I would be a very good asset to your publications work.,Prabhupāda," That I know. You are qualified, educated boy. You can do it. But one thing I can do, that you can live with your family just like they are living. That I can arrange. And whatever food we can provide you have to accept. We can... We can arrange for the education of your children also, everything. But we cannot pay anything. That is not possible. We can take charge of the husband and wife. We can take charge of your children. But it is not possible to pay. And besides that, when there is question of payment the service is not good because the payment means he is serving the money. He is not serving the cause. (tape of kīrtana plays for a second)"
Guest (4),His old mother listens to these chantings. [break],Prabhupāda," No, no, he has appeared to establish dharma . So what is the dharma according..."
Guest (4),Śāstra- dharma . Śāstra means Ārya-samājī- pratiṣṭhā ...,Prabhupāda, So what is that śāstra veda dharma ?
Guest (4),Vedic dharma .,Prabhupāda, So what is that? Explain it practically.
Guest (4),"Yama , niyama , samādhi , dhyāna ...",Prabhupāda," No, that is the process. So what is the end of dharma ?"
Guest (4),Self-realization.,Prabhupāda, What is that self?
Guest (4),That is to be realized. (laughter),Prabhupāda," This is going on. One has no idea what is dharma , what is the end, but he becomes, ""Oh, I have appeared for establishing dharma ."" And when he is asked, ""What is that dharma ?"" ""It is to be realized."" Then what you have realized that you are preaching dharma ?"
Guest (4),Sadācāra...,Prabhupāda, Sadācāra is the means. Sadācāra is not the end.
Guest (4),Can I know as to what made these young people want to leave the affluent present society and join this...,Prabhupāda," Because they are sincere, seeking after..."
Guest (4),"Pardon, sir?",Prabhupāda," They are sincere, sincerely seeking after. Their material business is finished because they have enjoyed enough of material things. Now there is spiritual inquiry. That is natural. When our material necessities are complete, we enjoy, then next stage is spiritual hankering. And that is explained in the Vedānta - sūtra , athāto brahma jijñāsā . After finishing karma - kāṇḍīya life... Karma - kāṇḍīya life means you do pious activities and enjoy life. That is called karma - kāṇḍīya . So... But the fact is that even you get your birth in a very rich family, you cannot avoid the sufferings of this material nature. Just like yesterday we had an interview with Holkar(?), His Highness Holkar, the old gentleman. So he was a king. He has got very beautiful wife, very beautiful family, very palatial building, but he is not happy, we saw. So the foolish people, they do not know that in this material life there is no happiness. They hanker after these palatial buildings, the motor cars, the bank balance, and so on, so on. Therefore those who have enjoyed all these things but have not become happy, there is another inquiry: ""How to become happy?"" [break] ...say America, they have enjoyed material life. Their children have enjoyed material life to the fullest extent but they are not happy. Therefore they have come to this spiritual life."
Guest (4),Last night in your learned discourse you said that you're supposed to found a temple in this city.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (4),"But you preach the Vedic mārga . Don't you think that instead of building a temple, āśramas in this brahmacārī model would be...",Prabhupāda, Yes. And without temple the brahmacārīs will be vyabhicāris. (laughter)
Guest (4),That āśrama becomes a temple.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that we... Wherever we have got a center we have got a temple and at the same time teaching. These two things must go parallel. If simply dry teachings go on and there is no temple worship, then gradually he will glide down to vyabhicāri instead of brahmacārī ."
Guest (4),"Besides the chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and arousing(?) this Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the people, what else are you doing to establish the way...?",Prabhupāda, That you have seen this morning. We are teaching every day the śāstra . They are not simply chanting. Their chanting is based on understanding. Therefore they are sticking.(?)
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , the educational system of this country has so much deteriorated. I have been studying. I see young people of different colleges, boys and girls taking to LSD even in this city and doing to all sorts of nonsense. What is the best...?",Prabhupāda," That I was explaining. As soon as there is indulgence in illicit sex life, all bad qualification will come. That I was explaining."
Guest (4),"And Mahārāja , what are your impressions of the youth of this country?",Prabhupāda," I have no estimation of this country or that country. I know everywhere, because spiritual education is lacking, everywhere the boys and girls are fallen."
Guest (4),Is secularism coming in way of spreading spiritual education?,Prabhupāda," Secularism is a bogus thing. You see? That is an indulgence, ""Whatever you like, you can do. Whatever religion you follow, that's all..."" No. That is not good. The state should be responsible for the spiritual progress of the citizens. Now, especially in our country, we say it is Hindustan, Bhāratavarṣa. So we are not giving the bhāratīya or Hindu spiritual cultural education. So that's a great loss of the secular state."
Guest (4),Do you think that the present democratic system will be able to impart a spiritual education?,Prabhupāda, No.
Guest (4),Then what system do you advocate?,Prabhupāda," Of course, so far Vedic culture is concerned, they advocated monarchy because the one man's training, a good king guided by the brahminical culture, although it was autocratic sometimes, but because the king was very cultured there was no possibility of doing any harm to the citizens. But democracy means simply they are given the post by votes, and they may be all rascals. Then what they can think of good to the citizens?"
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , don't you think that monarchy (unclear)",Prabhupāda," No, that is also not possible. And therefore we are training people to be Kṛṣṇa conscious. And when the Kṛṣṇa conscious people will elect Kṛṣṇa conscious leaders there will be peace and prosperity. And now, because the minority is Kṛṣṇa conscious, they cannot elect Kṛṣṇa conscious leaders and therefore havoc is being played."
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , do you think the West is being Hinduized?",Prabhupāda," The ""Hinduized"" is a sectarian view. We are not..."
Guest (4),"I mean this, being brought up on sanātana culture.",Prabhupāda, Vedic ways. Yes. You can... The perfect word is Vedic civilization.
Guest (4),Vedic civilization.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is original civilization. Out of Vedic civilization there are so many outcome now, but if you go originally to the Vedic civilization, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the Bhagavad- gītā you will find the word is vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam [Bg. 15.15 ] . That means to follow the Vedic way of life means to become Kṛṣṇa conscious."
Guest (5),(unclear),Prabhupāda," Yes, Vedic way means they are following principles, regulative principles."
Guest (5),So what principle?,Prabhupāda," That I was explaining. That is a big principle. But it has been shortened, shortened in this age. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam , kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] . In the Kali - yuga you cannot reform the whole population by any other means except this harer nāma . Therefore we are introducing Hare Kṛṣṇa movement everywhere."
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , do the Western and Eastern societies respond differently to this call...",Prabhupāda," No. You cannot say that. Two plus two equal to four everywhere, East and West. There is no difference, East and West. It is scientific. It is vijñaṇa . So when you call of, talk of science, there is no difference of understanding in the East and West. The same thing is understood."
Guest (4),"Mahārāja , (Hindi)",Prabhupāda," Yes. Varnāśrama - dharma ... That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . Cātur - varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] . Qualified. Therefore we want qualified brāhmaṇas, qualified kṣatriyas. At the present moment, without being qualified, they are passing on as brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya . That is not varṇāśrama . Without being qualified they are all śūdras, all caṇḍālas. But when they are properly trained and qualified, then it is varṇāśrama , real varṇāśrama ."
Guest (4),"Where are they to be trained, then? How are they...",Prabhupāda, That we are proposing. When we open a center we shall train anyone. It doesn't matter whether he is born in a śūdra family or brāhmaṇa family. Just like they are born in a different family other than brāhmaṇa but they are now brāhmaṇa because after being trained up.
Guest (4),"(Hindi) ...regard, you said that monarchy and democracy, both are systems which cannot help this cause. Then...",Prabhupāda," No, why cannot help? If... Monarchy means the king was properly trained up. Similarly, in the democracy, if people are properly trained up, then they will vote for nice men and there will be nice government. Now, because the people are not trained, they are practically asses. The votes of the asses, what has the meaning? If the majority are asses, then one ass will be elected. That's all. So when the executive head is an ass what benefit he can do to the people?"
Guest (5); Guest (4),"I see.; Mahārāja , you said that you had been misrepresented in that report which appeared yesterday in one of the dailies of the cities.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (4),How could you like to mend your statement?,Prabhupāda, My statements are clear there but he has mis-stated in the heading with ulterior purpose.
Guest (4),I think he has...,Prabhupāda," Young men of cities, they may come to me and be trained up in the spiritual life, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (Hindi) So long you'll ask me to keep here, provided you are serious of taking training from me..."
Guest (4),I am very much serious.,Prabhupāda, Then you are welcome. I am asking young men like you to come and join me.
Guest (5),(unintelligible),Prabhupāda," Aiye. Yes. I am speaking in English because my students, they cannot understand Hindi. But if educated young boys like you come they will be also able to understand English, so there will be no difficulty."
Guest (4),"Thank you, Mahārāja .",Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa . Replay little. [break] Please try to understand the philosophy. Thank you. Yes. (Hindi) So you are welcome. You come. Live with us with your family. We take charge of you. But if you ask some salary, that is not possible. That is not possible."
Guest (4),I have my sisters and mother and father to support.,Prabhupāda," So let them come, all, and live with me. (Hindi) That's nice. (Hindi). That I can take. But if you want money, that is not possible."
Guest (5),"No, I don't want money.",Prabhupāda, Then you come with your whole family. (Hindi) [break]
Guest (5),"Perhaps they are the people, the older followers of...",Prabhupāda," Not always these people. Not all. (Hindi) We have created this problem. (Hindi) [break] You'll get your bread, bara , and somebody will fill up your belly. (Hindi) It is not possible. (Hindi)"
Guest (6),"Swamiji, suppose one wants to become life member... They can't pay whole money in one charge. They want to pay in installments.",Prabhupāda," That's nice. We shall accept. Oh, yes."
Guest (6),They told me that it is impossible for them to pay whole sum.,Prabhupāda, That doesn't matter. Let him pay by...
Guest (6),They are ready to pay two or three installments.,Prabhupāda, That's all right. It is accepted. Please bring them.
Guest (6),"One man, that Bengali person, he is coming. He wants to become member but he is telling that ""I am unable to pay whole...""",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. That doesn't matter. Let him pay by installments."
Guest (6),"I told him I will ask you, whether you are ready or not.",Prabhupāda, (Hindi)
Guest (6),"He is coming daily, that man.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Mr. Chakravarti or Chatterjee. Yes."
Guest (6),Chatterjee. He is scared of people.(?),Prabhupāda," He is good boy. Yes. No. He had the cap on his head, sweater, cap and pant."
Guest (6),Yesterday he was asking me to ask you.,Prabhupāda, Where is my stick? Give me a glass of water. [break]
Guest (6),I am ready to pay installments.,Prabhupāda, Then there is no problem. You come and join me. If you want...
Guest (6),Let me get degree.,Prabhupāda," You get your degree. That's all right. Finish your education. If I'll be able to open a center, nice center, I shall call so many people, ""Come and live with me and be trained up."" I am just writing one advertisement. We shall have to publish it. Just read it."
Haṁsadūta; Yamunā; Haṁsadūta,"""Wanted: qualified brāhmaṇas for preaching Bhagavad- gītā all over the world. (laughter) Candidates accepted without any discrimination of caste and creed. Apply ISKCON.""; Yamunā : Oh, ho, ho, Prabhupāda!; ""Life member can send any member of his family for being trained up as a qualified brāhmaṇa who can preach Bhagavad- gītā as it is all over the world."" You're going to put this in the newspaper?",Prabhupāda, Huh ? Yes.
Haṁsadūta,"Oh, that will be nice. (laughter)",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Oh, that's a wonderful notice, Prabhupāda. It's so wonderful.",Prabhupāda," We have to preach all over the world. We require so many men, so many boys, girls, men we want."
Haṁsadūta; Haṁsadūta,"I should send this to the GBC members...; ...in the West, and they should put ads in the paper.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Let us have application.
Haṁsadūta,Should I copy it down?,Prabhupāda," Yes, you take it. You take it. Type it."
Himāvatī,"Prabhupāda, in Calcutta Madhudviṣa advertised like that at one meeting, and the next day a man came...",Prabhupāda, Only one man?
Haṁsadūta; Himāvatī,"Two men came.; With his six children and his wife, they were prepared, ""Let us live here. We will see.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Himāvatī,And another old man that was so old that he was ready to die. (laughter),Prabhupāda," Then you write, ""Young men."" No, even old man, there is no question. That we can test, whether he is able, he is a qualified brāhmaṇa . First of all he is qualified brāhmaṇa ."
Himāvatī,"You were going to Peruda(?) that day, so we said, ""When we return, then you come and join us."" But when we returned they didn't come. They changed their mind.",Prabhupāda, Yes. They cannot. They cannot. Only young men can join. Old men cannot join. (Hindi)
Guest (6),Asoka Kumar.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, I remember. So please, after finishing your education you come and join this great movement. They are joining Communist movement, this movement, that movement. Why not a real genuine movement for the welfare of the whole?"
Guest (6),I am not joining any...,Prabhupāda," No, I mean to say..."
Guest (6),I want to join...,Prabhupāda, Generally they join. Generally they join.
Guest (6),My brother also agrees to stay with you.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that's nice."
Guest (6),From today I am ready to join you.,Prabhupāda," No, you finish your education. That will be a good qualification."
Guest (6),Why not you are paying a visit in Lakhpur(?). There is a very big Gītā Mandir.,Prabhupāda, Everywhere there is Gītā Mandir. Here there is also big Gītā Mandir.
Guest (6),"No, there... Here they have mixture of many gods. Not like that. There is only one Gītā , and all, the whole temple, belongs to Gītā and nothing else.",Prabhupāda," So if they invite, I can go. Why don't you ask them to invite us? Then we can go immediately."
Guest (6),Whole temple there is a pracāra (?) Gītā .,Prabhupāda, But how many preachers they have produced?
Guest (6),"You must be knowing that Vidyananda , Swami Vidyananda .",Prabhupāda," Oh, he's a great nonsense."
Guest (6),"Oh, no.",Prabhupāda, I know.
Guest (6),He has constructed that from Gujarat. He's a Gujārati.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (6),He constructed a temple there.,Prabhupāda," I have seen in Ahmedabad his temple. He established one deity, a woman shape, and there is no Kṛṣṇa . ""Gītā."" ""Gītā"" means a woman. So I don't think he has full understanding of Gītā . He has money; he has spent. That's all. But he does not understand Gītā . Gītā means unless one takes Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead he does not understand anything of Gītā . That is the test. He may advertise himself as scholar or this or that, but our only test is whether he accepts Kṛṣṇa , the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . That is the test. Is that person accepting Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He himself accepts that ""I am God."" Is it not? Therefore he's a foolish. He is squandering money, public money. That's all. That is his business. He might have some qualification to collect money, but he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa ."
Guest (6),He's all (unclear).,Prabhupāda, But I think he is dead.
Guest (6),"He is dead now or he... Sadhanananda is dead, Swami Sadhananda.",Prabhupāda," I know. So that is the test. That is the test. Therefore it is a revolutionary movement. Even so-called followers of Gītā , they will be caught up by this movement as rascals. Because the real purpose of Gītā they do not know. Real purpose of Gītā is to know Kṛṣṇa , the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That you will find in the Bhagavad- gītā . Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi madhava [Bg. 10.14 ] . And Arjuna says that ""Whatever You have said, they're all right and I accept them in toto without any revision."" So Kṛṣṇa says that ""I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead."" One who does not understand Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person, what he has read Gītā ? He is useless. Śrama eva hi kevalam [ SB 1.2.8 ] . Simply has labored. That's all. That is the test. Don't you agree to this point? So anyone who does not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has no knowledge of Gītā . He immediately becomes foolish. That is our test. So Muktananda, what do you think?"
Muktananda,"Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is the test, whether he has understood. In the Seventh Chapter,"
Guest (6),"(unclear)... From the very day I saw this movement, I have intent only in Kṛṣṇa , not in any other movement.",Prabhupāda," So that is our movement. Wherever we go, we find out sincere persons, immediately attract. Yes. But if he's not sincere, we cannot attract. If he's sincere, immediately attract. That is the value of this movement. All my students, they were attracted only because they were sincere. Anyone sincere in seeking after the Absolute Truth will be attracted."
Guest (6),I am not getting ...(unclear),Prabhupāda," Ekāgra . Ekāgra . Yogaṁ yuñjan mad - āśrayaḥ , therefore it is said. ""One has to perform this bhakti - yoga under My representative."" Mad - āśrayaḥ ."
Guest (6),I am very grateful to you.,Prabhupāda," And there is Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura- Prārthanā . Āśraya laiyā bhaje , kṛṣṇa nāhi tare tyāge : ""One who takes āśraya , shelter of a devotee, Kṛṣṇa does not give him up. Kṛṣṇa accepts him."" Yasya prasādād bhagavat - prasādaḥ ... **. Because if that person who is giving shelter, if he's pleased, Kṛṣṇa is immediately... If he recommends a fool, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa , here is a devotee,"" Kṛṣṇa will accept immediately. It doesn't matter whether he's a fool or rascal. Because he is recommended by representative, he will be accepted. Yasya pra ... This is the meaning of yasya prasādad bhagavat - pra ... Without his recommendation there is no entry in Kṛṣṇa's kingdom. Yasya -prasādad na gatiḥ kuto 'pi. If he displeases Kṛṣṇa's representative he has no entrance to the Kṛṣṇa's kingdom, however learned he may be or whatever he may be. Immediately rejected. In a business office, suppose a secretary is there. A clerk does not accept the order of the secretary. Immediately he should be dismissed. In my personal experience, when I was young manager in a big chemical concern, one correspondent clerk, he disobeyed me. I reported to the head boss. He immediately came and he said, ""Get out immediately from the office."" And he wanted to plead in so many ways. Said, ""No, I don't want. If you don't go out, then I shall call my doorman. He will forcibly get you out. Get out."" I was sorry because this man is dismissed immediately, but he took. Disobedient... ""Obedience is first discipline."" So if Kṛṣṇa's representative is disobeyed—""Get out immediately."" Kṛṣṇa is very strict."
Guest (6),(unclear) ...From tomorrow he was not able to get (unclear),Prabhupāda," Yes. Just see. Yes. Therefore in our system Vaiṣṇavāparādha is the greatest offense, to commit offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava , and spiritual master is to be considered the first Vaiṣṇava . If there is aparādha , that is great, greatest offense. That will spoil the whole spiritual life. These are stated in Caitanya - caritāmṛta . In Teachings of Lord Caitanya you'll find."
Guest (6),In yesterday's paper I read that somebody donated some land to you.,Prabhupāda, Yes. No. He has proposed to donate; not he has done. Where you learned this?
Guest (6),In that (unclear),Prabhupāda," Yes, somebody has promised. Somebody has promised."
Guest (6),"And it will (unclear) Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa mandir, I will possibly able to get (unclear)",Prabhupāda," Yes, why not?"
Guest (6),"Swamiji, you are here still.",Prabhupāda, But if somebody gives me land I may go on staying here.
Guest (6),"No, no, father and mother, they are forcing me to leave you all in my home.",Prabhupāda, Where it is?
Guest (6),It is nearby.,Prabhupāda," Your father, mother, cannot come here?"
Guest (6); Revatīnandana,They want you to come.; They've come here before.,Prabhupāda, Oh. (end)
Guest (1) (Indian man),"Whatever I have read, but, you see, I don't believe what I have read. I believe only whatever I have talked to you, whatever you have said.",Prabhupāda," No, no, that is another thing. But still, what is your conception of our philosophy? What is that teaching?"
Guest (1),Whose? My?,Prabhupāda," No, as we are?"
Guest (1),"No, I have understood what I have heard from you, what is your conception of God, I have not understood.",Prabhupāda," Our conception of God is that He is a transcendental person. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid- ānanda - vigrahaḥ [Bs. 5.1] . Īśvara means Lord. The Supreme Lord is a person. As you are person, He is also person, but He is the chief person. Nityo nityānāṁ. He is the leader, and we are all led. Or He is the master; we are the servitors. That is our self-realization, to understand that ""I am eternal servant of God."" In Bhagavad- gītā it is said, mamaivāṁśo jīva - bhūtaḥ jīva - loke sanātanaḥ : [Bg. 15.7 ] ""Eternally all the living entities are My part and parcels."" So as the part and parcel of anything is to serve the cause of the whole, similarly, all living entities, their only business is to serve the Supreme. That is all."
Guest (1),"Swamiji, I have understood that the...(indistinct)... if Gītā is written afterwards by Sanjaya , then...",Prabhupāda, Then what?
Guest (1),"Then just to prove... (indistinct) According to me, when Lord Kṛṣṇa ... (indistinct) When the ātmā goes into the trance, the mind goes into the trance, and into the śuddha - sattva , then he gets the vision of all, past, future, and present.",Prabhupāda," First thing that you said, that Bhagavad- gītā was given in seven verses, and later on, Vyāsadeva has expanded. Now, suppose accepting that Vyāsadeva has expanded, do you find any difference between Vyāsadeva's explanation and the original seven verses?"
Guest (1),"No. Of course, that is... (unintelligible)",Prabhupāda," Then, accepting even that Vyāsadeva has expanded, so there is no difference. Therefore, even if we take the Bhagavad- gītā as it is presented by Vyāsadeva, so there is nothing to be said against it."
Guest (1),Nothing.,Prabhupāda," Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu , he gave us only eight verses, Śikṣāṣṭaka. But our Gosvāmīs, they have written volumes of books on that eight verses. But there is no difference of the writings of the Gosvāmīs and the original eight verses. That is not very important thing."
Guest (1),"One more, sir. Lord Kṛṣṇa has never asked Arjuna to sit and do bhajana . He said, uttiṣṭha mām anusmara yuddhya: [ Bg. 8.7 ] ""Get up and fight! And fight! And fight! That fight, that is your right."" I'll fight. That is...",Prabhupāda, Yes. So fight with whom?
Guest (1),"""Fight with your enemy.""",Prabhupāda, Who is your enemy?
Guest (1),"Even physical, bodily, whatever it is, whatever it is, but you must know who your enemies are. Your enemy may be my friend. (part indistinct)",Prabhupāda," That's nice proposal. Unless you find an enemy, how you can fight? So of course, we do not say... We Vaiṣṇavas do not say that there is no need of fighting. We never say. When there is need of fighting we must fight. Rather, somebody in New York, some Goldsmith, he was that, ""Why Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna to fight, to become violent?"" So somebody protests like that. But there is no meaning of protesting against the action of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is our view. So we Vaiṣṇavas, we are chanting. It does not mean that when there is need of fighting with avaiṣṇava we shall lack in strength. We can fight. One gentleman inquired from me that ""Vaiṣṇavism makes one dull. He cannot act."" And, ""No. You have not seen a Vaiṣṇava ."" In the two fightings, great fighting, the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, the hero was Hanuman and Arjuna , and they fought."
Guest (1),They fought.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And who can be better Vaiṣṇava than them?
Guest (1),Nobody.,Prabhupāda, So Vaiṣṇava does not mean he is dull. No.
Guest (1),"No, that is well proved. If there is need...",Prabhupāda," Yes. So our present fighting is atheism, against atheism. They say, ""There is no God. God is dead. I am God. You are God."" We are fighting against these principles. So our fighting is very strong. You don't think that we are keeping idly. I have come here to fight with these atheists, you see, and we go everywhere. We are fighting with atheists all over the world. So we are meeting so many opposing elements. You see? They say, ""God is dead."" In America, when I first went, they were popularizing theory that ""God is dead."" But they again accepted and:  God is not dead, but He is here with Swamiji."" They accepted. So these atheistic theories, that ""Everyone is God,"" ""I am God,"" ""you are God,"" ""God is dead,"" ""there is no God,"" ""God is not person""—we are fighting against these principles. We say, ""God is Kṛṣṇa . The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa . He is a person, and He is not dead."" This is our preaching. Therefore it is a fight."
Guest (1),He is not dead. He is not dead.,Prabhupāda," How He can be dead? How you can think of like that, that God is dead? That is foolishness."
Guest (1),"If you say God is dead, that means you are... that is your own ignorance.",Prabhupāda," So we are fighting against this ignorance, so many ignorance. And at the present moment so many theories and religious principles have sprung up unnecessarily. You see? But we are sticking to the principle that the only religion is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is real religion: surrender."
Guest (1),Complete surrender.,Prabhupāda," Complete surrender. That is real religion. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityjya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja . Man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. 18.65 ] . These are Kṛṣṇa's words. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. 7.19 ] . Prapadyate —that is surrender. Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. 4.11 ] . These words are there."
Guest (1),I like only the last ślokas... (indistinct)... where Lord Kṛṣṇa analyzes and... (indistinct) ...but to bring your mind and ātmā together that process is called yoga .,Prabhupāda," But you know that Kṛṣṇa said, yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad -gatenāntarātmanā: [Bg. 6.47 ] ""Of all the yogis, one who is always thinking of Me within his mind, he is first-class."" Do you accept this?"
Guest (1),Of all the yoginām ?,Prabhupāda," Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ : ""Of all the yogis..."" Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ . That is the last verse of the yoga chapter, sāṅkhya - yoga chapter. Yoginām ... When Arjuna said that ""This practice of aṣṭāṅga- yoga is not possible for me."""
Guest (1),"No, of course not.",Prabhupāda," No, he said. When he said like that, so Kṛṣṇa answered, ""Yes, practice. If you practice, it can be possible. But still, anyone..."" He summarized the whole yoga process, yoginām api sarveṣāṁ : ""Of all yogis, anyone who is thinking of Me always, he is the first-class yogi ."""
Guest (1),That is karma - yoga .,Prabhupāda, Why do you say karma - yoga ? Where you get this?
Guest (1),"""Whatever you do."" ""Whatever you do."" It is not written that you should do the aṣṭāṅga- yoga .",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. We are discussing this verse. He said that ""Anyone who is always think..."" Karma - yogi also always thinks of Kṛṣṇa . That's all right. That is not denied. But the highest principle is always keeping Kṛṣṇa within his mind. Premāñjana-cchurita... That is confirmed in the Brahma - saṁhitā . Premāñjana-cchurita- bhakti -vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti [Bs. 5.38] . This kind of practice of yoga can be done by an unalloyed devotee. Premāñjana-cchurita, by developing the dormant love of God. That is... That is the highest perfection. And another thing is, you are accepting mind as ātmā , are you not? That's not correct. Mind is not ātmā ."
Guest (1),"No, no, mind is not ātmā . No. The ātmā and mind, they come together, each other come. When your mind does not go from here to there...",Prabhupāda," Yes, mind fixed up in ātmā . That's nice. But mind is not ātmā ."
Guest (1),"No, no.",Prabhupāda," Mind is matter, subtle matter."
Guest (1),Certainly. That is the laws.,Prabhupāda," Mind is kind of fume of the ātmā . So mind becomes, changes the color of the fume according to the state of the ātmā . If the ātmā is in pure state, then mind is pure. If the ātmā is impure state, the mind is impure. So we have taught all our disciples, satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ [Bg. 9.14 ] , always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa . Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ [Bg. 9.14 ] ."
Guest (1),Satataṁ kīrtayanto yo māṁ ...,Prabhupāda," No. Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha - vratāḥ [Bg. 9.14 ] . Dṛḍha - vratāḥ : ""One who is always chanting about Me and endeavoring with great determination to reach Me, he is mahātmā ."""
Guest (1),"As you have said, nāhaṁ tiṣṭhāmi vaikuṇṭhe yogināṁ hṛdayeṣu vā mad -bhakteṣ...",Prabhupāda," Tiṣṭhāmi. That's it. Therefore a devotee's position is sublime. Kṛṣṇa comes as a devotee also. Actually this happened. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he happened to be a Mohammedan, Lord Caitanya's devotee. So in those days, five hundred years ago, there was some Hindu -Muslim... Still that is going on. So he did not enter Jagannātha temple to create some disturbance. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also did not ask him that ""You go to Jagannātha temple. Who can check you?"" Of course, if Caitanya Mahāprabhu had ordered, he would have gone. Neither he wanted to go, neither Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that ""You must go."" Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to come to him. Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad - bhaktāḥ . This is the practical. He came to the devotee where he was chanting. So instead of approaching God, if you chant, God will approach you. That is a fact, we see. Instead of Haridāsa Ṭhākura going to Jagannātha , Jagannātha Himself was coming to him. Every day Lord Caitanya would come and ask and sit down, ""How you are feeling? What you are doing?"" Then He would go to take bath in Samudra . Daily. It was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... And when Haridāsa Ṭhākura expired, He personally took the body and cremated on the bank of the Samudra and he performed the funeral ceremony. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was so... And he was given the title nāmācārya, ""authority of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra ."" Very nice that you are cultivating this knowledge. It is very nice. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3 ]. This cultivation of spiritual knowledge means perfection of life. But people do not try for it. Therefore Gītā says, manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu : ""Out of many thousands of men, one may try to cultivate knowledge for spiritual advancement."" And yatatām api siddhānāṁ : [Bg. 7.3 ] ""Out of many such persons who are cultivating spiritual knowledge, hardly one can understand what is Kṛṣṇa ."""
Guest (1),Very correct. To understand Him is a lot.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is liberation. Janma karma me divyam yo janati tattvataḥ [Bg. 4.9 ] . To understand Kṛṣṇa ... Nobody can understand Kṛṣṇa , but still, to such an extent, if one can understand Him, then he immediately becomes liberated. Immediately. And not to speak of developing his love of Kṛṣṇa , simply by knowledge, by real knowledge, if one understands Kṛṣṇa , that is sufficient to make him liberated. And those who are devotees, for them liberation is very insignificant. Muktir mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'sman."
Guest (1),"On the first day of this inauguration, and there were definitions about karma - yoga .",Prabhupāda," Oh, the governor. (laughter) Just see. He is speaking of karma - yoga . Slaughtering ten thousand cows, that is karma - yoga . This nonsense speaking of karma - yoga ."
Guest (1),So actually I shall present...,Prabhupāda, The governor became little perturbed. He wanted to go immediately. You were present? And when the other men began to speak all hodgepodge...
Guest (1),"I like your one sentence that day. Whatever is according to the śāstras, that is correct. I agree to it. Nobody says that.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is a fact."
Guest (1),That's a fact.,Prabhupāda, Karma done does not mean that you manufacture something and it becomes a karma .
Guest (1),"It is written, whatever, in śāstras.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),That is karma - yoga .,Prabhupāda," Yes. I was just going to explain all this karma , vikarma , akarma ."
Guest (1),What does he know? (laughs),Prabhupāda," In India, the land of sages, land of Kṛṣṇa , land of Lord Rāmacandra , land of Mahārāja Parīkṣit , without any restriction cow slaughter is going on. And they are speaking of karma - yoga . Just see the fun."
Guest (1),"I don't know where this India is going to, the land of Kṛṣṇa is going to.",Prabhupāda," Well... No, we should try our best."
Guest (1),We have to fight these habits. It is our duty.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that's it. So you are a military man. I request you to fight against this nonsense."
Guest (1),"Swami, I wish you could come sometime. I will gather section of some people.",Prabhupāda," Yes, I'll go. I'll go. Where? Just fix up some time."
Guest (1),"Because I am very near to temple, only 100 yards.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. That Takat? (?) Takat?
Guest (1),"No, not Takat.",Prabhupāda," Oh, I see, oh. We are thinking of having a branch near that Takat, in that Takat colony. What is your idea? Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness center. Is that a good locality?"
Guest (1),I'll tell you. I'll fight Tukori(?). (indistinct)...,Prabhupāda," All right. No, no. Think twice before doing."
Haṁsadūta; Guest (1),"Tuesday morning, December 15th?; Tuesday morning? Morning, I have to go to a village somewhere.",Prabhupāda, You give them after seven.
Guest (1),"Ah, no, whenever opportunity.",Prabhupāda," All right, then make..."
Haṁsadūta,Evenings are all engaged.,Prabhupāda," Oh, evenings are... But evenings up to which date? Tuesday?"
Guest (1),Up to the sixteenth.,Prabhupāda," Up to the sixteenth? Then probably on the seventeenth we may go. Not fixed up, but there is chance. That is chance because we are thinking of an appointment with the prime minister in Delhi by the eighteenth, so if that is fixed up, then we have to start."

Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),(Hindi?) (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. These boys also, from their childhood they are addicted to so many things. Gave up immediately."
Guest (1),That's nice.,Prabhupāda," Immediately on my word they gave up. Meat-eaters, they have been described by Canakya Pandit."
Guest (1),"Though we are kṣatriyas, but nobody takes meat in our house.",Prabhupāda," Kṣatriyas are allowed to take meat by hunting, not by slaughterhouse. Not all, but some of them."
Guest (1),"When you can't get anything to eat, then only you can do that. (indistinct)",Prabhupāda, (indistinct) ...not in my sannyāsa stage. Long ago accepted sannyāsa . Sometimes in 1945.
Guest (1),Are you going there now this month?,Prabhupāda," No, I can go everywhere if the arrangement... Aiye."
Guest (1); Yamunā,(Hindi discussion with other Indians); Yamunā : Janaka Mahārāja .,Prabhupāda," Canakya, Canakya Pandit. He was a great politician and brāhmaṇa ."
Yamunā,Yamunā : Was he in Lord Caitanya's time?,Prabhupāda," No, no. He was five thousand years..., not. Three thousand years."
Haṁsadūta; Devotee; Haṁsadūta; Guest (1),He was a great devotee?; No.; No?; He was politician. He was a mathematician.,Prabhupāda," He was very learned scholar, brāhmaṇa , rigid brāhmaṇa . That's all."
Guest (1),He was insulted once in boyhood by something of Mahātmānanda.,Prabhupāda, Nanda .
Guest (1); Haṁsadūta,"Then he took oath that ""All right, today I turn my (indistinct) and one day I will dethrone you from here. Then you can call me (indistinct),"" and he went away. (tells story); Great determination.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yamunā,Yamunā : He was a great devotee?,Prabhupāda, No.
Yamunā,Yamunā : So he's not authority.,Prabhupāda," No, no, he was not authority in the spiritual sense. He was a politician, moralist, politician. That's all. Worldly man."
Haṁsadūta; Guest (1),"How many people will be there?; Swamiji, you were telling something?",Prabhupāda," Yes. I don't find... [break] ... vanaṁ sattvaṁ na durjante, sattva vasanti , tad eva ca durjanas tu pade pade. This is another verse."
Guest (1),(Sanskrit),Prabhupāda," So we made some life member. Is there any possibility of getting, enrolling some life member? That...?"
Guest (1),Life member means...?,Prabhupāda, Institution. We want some life members. Otherwise how we can conduct this institution? (indistinct) Through telegram? Or reply?
Haṁsadūta,I think it was returned.,Prabhupāda, Who sent?
Haṁsadūta,"Gita Bhavan Sect.(?), Gita Bhavan Marg, Indore. ""Please reply definite arrival time, Surat. Very anxious. Janwal, care of (indistinct)."" That's how he replied.",Prabhupāda, So there we are already engaged. Cannot go Surat immediately. Let us follow that.
Haṁsadūta,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Yes. That is his version. Version. There is no cost. Simply (indistinct).
Haṁsadūta,So what is the program there?,Prabhupāda," Never mind. ""Due to heavy engagement, cannot go Surat immediately. Letter follows."""
Devotee (2),Motorcycle...(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Are you sure, that motorcycle? Can? To go and come back here for attending meeting here? By train? How far it is?"
Haṁsadūta,About fifteen minutes.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that's all right. That's all."
Haṁsadūta; Yamunā; Haṁsadūta,"No, no, we won't take any prasādam today.(?) We are fasting till noon because it is the appearance day of our Guru Mahārāja's spiritual master.; Yamunā : Disappearance.; Disappearance? Oh. We won't be taking anything at all. Nothing.",Prabhupāda, Up to twelve we don't take. Fast.
Guest (1),(indistinct) ...in my house?,Prabhupāda," Whatever arrangement you do, that's all right. But if some of you members become our life members, that will be..."
Haṁsadūta,Have you seen our books? Would you like to see?,Prabhupāda, So you can explain. [break] ...the footprints of liberated predecessors like Manu and others. So they are conditioned. Therefore their rules and regulations are not perfect. It cannot be perfect.
Haṁsadūta; Guest (1); Haṁsadūta; Guest (1),"Here is our monthly magazine, Back to Godhead. These are our... (indistinct) This is in Washington, D.C. This is in Berkeley, California. That magazine is being printed in six languages: Hindi, English, French, German, and Japanese, and Bengali. Bengali is not yet out, but it's coming. Then Prabhupāda started presenting these books while he was still in India. This book was published in 1965. This was printed in India, the First Canto of the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . The First Canto comprises three volumes like this, the First Canto. And then the following Cantos are being printed by our own press in America in Boston, like this, chapter by chapter, so that people can take advantage of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam and read it at their convenience instead of...; (indistinct); And here, Kṛṣṇa Book, is the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . Prabhupāda calls it, ""Kṛṣṇa: The Supreme Personality of Godhead."" And it's full of illustrations which are done by his American students. Just see how beautiful. There are eighty-four full color illustrations that show the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa . So the people in the western world and for the first time in the history of the world will get an idea of who God is, what He looks like, what He does, where He's residing. This is the Kṛṣṇa Book, in two volumes. This is volume number one and this is volume number two. This is just a blueprint. We haven't got a printed copy yet. Then Teachings of Lord Caitanya , Caitanya - caritāmṛta , which you must be familiar with, in the Teachings of Lord Caitanya and there are also illustrations although they're not color. They're black and white.; Śrī Tukārāma is disciple of Caitanya .",Prabhupāda," He also went through in Maharastra by His chanting, (indistinct)"
Haṁsadūta; Guest (1),"And most important, Prabhupāda has presented Bhagavad- gītā . He calls it ""Bhagavad- gītā As It Is."" He explains in the introduction that till now there's been so many Bhagavad-gitas printed in all languages and all of them are misrepresenting. They have not presented Bhagavad- gītā as it is. They are trying to present Bhagavad- gītā without Kṛṣṇa . They want to leave out the speaker of Bhagavad- gītā and put themselves forward. So Prabhupāda has presented Bhagavad- gītā As It Is and therefore this movement has taken such hold because the real thing is being presented. This is in San Francisco, California. Then, the Nectar of Devotion, Rūpa Gosvāmī's book Bhakti - rasāmṛta - sindhu , also there. This book is the lawbook of devotional service. Īśopaniṣad, word for word translation, then the complete English translation and purport by His Divine Grace. So these books are (indistinct) bhakti - yoga (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa consciousness (indistinct) explaining the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra . So we have so much literature. And in India we've introduced a program, our membership program, so that we can go on distributing these literatures. And that membership program, there are four types of membership. One is life membership. Life membership means the member is entitled to all the books that we have printed plus all the books we will print in the future, plus a lifetime subscription to our magazine, Back to Godhead. And the member is entitled to stay at any one of our branches throughout the world free and if he happens to travel abroad or in India. We will have our branches. So that life membership fee is 1,111 rupees. And then we have donor membership. The donor member is entitled to all the books that have been printed, a lifetime subscription to our magazine, but he does not get the books in the future. That is 555 rupees. And subscriber membership, lifetime subscription to our magazine, which is 222 rupees. Or there is membership, yearly subscription to our magazine. In this way we're trying to recruit members that support our movement. This movement is being supported just by literature. So in this way we can flood the whole world with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then there'll be a change. If we want to see a change in the world, then we have to distribute knowledge of Kṛṣṇa in this way. You are welcome to become a member. And also your friends. Tell them about our membership programs.; Swamiji, open a center here.",Prabhupāda, I wish to. I wish to open a center.
Guest (1),"No, no, now?",Prabhupāda, Not yet.
Guest (1),And how many centers in India?,Prabhupāda," Practically, three."
Guest (1),"Swami, did you come across these Brahma -kumaris? They preach something else.",Prabhupāda, That is something else. Everyone knows it.
Guest (1),"Once they... I was in ... So they were passing through, teaching some Kṛṣṇa or something, and their Bhagavad- gita was something else.",Prabhupāda," That is going on. [break] There may be musical performance but here it is by the pure devotees. That is different thing. Now, here don't you see in the Gītā Bhavan ? When others perform kīrtana nobody takes part. And they cannot continue that kīrtana more than five minutes. But we can continue our kīrtana for five hours without any..."
Haṁsadūta,If we stayed there for five hours everyone would chant. (indistinct conversation),Prabhupāda," Yes. No, mahāmantra they can also do, but it will not be effective because they are not pure. Here is the secret. We have... Our devotees, they are anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyaṁ [ Brs. 1.1.11] , they have no other business than to satisfy Kṛṣṇa . They perform kīrtana to take something from Kṛṣṇa . Everyone goes to some dharma - saṁsthāna just to take something. But our proposition is to give everything for Kṛṣṇa and that is far different."
Haṁsadūta; Guest (2) (Indian man),"Everyone is pleased with the devotees, everybody.; (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," That when you do, I shall tell you. Now why do you waste your time in that way? That's all right, you are not doing so you have no business."
Guest (2),"(indistinct) Of course, I am not doing... (indistinct, several people talking at once.)",Prabhupāda," (Hindi) This is called vṛddha . This is called yoni . This is madhyama . This is anāvṛtta, and this is kaniṣṭha . (indistinct conversation) Stores are now closed?"
Haṁsadūta,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. So he has gone to Calcutta. [break] Utsāhan, dhairyāt . Are you realizing the distinction between this association and others?"
Revatīnandana,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That you should realize. That is realization. We are trying to create a real spiritual path, not bogus, for livelihood. India's falldown is due to that spirit, that everyone takes everything for livelihood, that's all. Not only India, everywhere. India especially because poverty-stricken. So they take religion also as livelihood. Just like this Akhila Saheb. He wanted to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra for livelihood. Do you know that?"
Devotee (3),Yes.,Prabhupāda," How? How it was? No, you do not know. He was proposing that ""I know how to cure disease by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" So he wanted to go to foreign countries to take this profession. That means an attempt to kill our movement in purity. Of course, nobody can kill our movement, but this sort of thinking is just against the purity of our movement: utilize Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra for curing disease. Oh, it will not stay."
Haṁsadūta,No. If we put it on the window it will stay. It won't stay on the wall.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Haṁsadūta,If he puts it on the window it will stay.,Prabhupāda, Window means it will be dark.
Haṁsadūta,Yes. I think that (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. It has to be done. Not only idea, it has to be done in practical sense. Now who will take charge of this task? That is to be found out. You write to the..."
Haṁsadūta,GBC?,Prabhupāda, GBC.
Haṁsadūta,"(unintelligible) So many newspapers have come out within the last three or four years. Of course, most of them are hippie groups, but they have become... People are very anxious to read something from different angle of vision.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,"They are tired of old newspapers. So if we present a newspaper with our angle of vision, Kṛṣṇa consciousness...",Prabhupāda, So immediately you write to the GBC members.
Haṁsadūta,"But the articles that will be in the newspaper, they will be exactly like other newspapers? Who will write them?",Prabhupāda," No, articles... Daily newspaper means there must be news. News you can purchase from the news collecting company. They will supply it. At very cheap price they'll supply. And you take advertisement. Yes. You'll cover your expenses by getting advertisements and make sufficient profit. Newspaper starting is not a losing business provided you can organize. Just like ordinary newspaper, they give... In daily news... People want to learn daily news, and they supply huge quantity. And those who are advertiser, they are simply concerned how many copies are issued. If you issue 100,000's of copies, then you can charge for each page thousand dollars. They will pay. Two thousand dollars they will pay."
Haṁsadūta,That means in each city we would we have to have our own local press.,Prabhupāda," No, not necessarily. You can arrange with any newspaper place. You simply supply your matter; they will print. Just like we are getting from Japan , similarly, make your own layout and supply them. Immediately, within two hours, everything is complete."
Haṁsadūta,"But a daily newspaper has to turn out daily, so it takes time to transport it from one city to another city.",Prabhupāda," Well, from every city we can publish. Every city there is a newspaper place."
Devotee (4),"...national, just like the national...",Prabhupāda," Yes. So we have to organize. First of all let us publish in one city, big city like New York, like London, yes, Bombay, Tokyo. Big cities, world's big cities. In India only two cities are big: Calcutta, and Bombay, important. If you publish simultaneously, Calcutta... Delhi is given importance due to capital; otherwise not important as big city, as Bombay and Calcutta. Delhi, without government offices it is a dead city. Just like Washington. What is the value of Washington? It is nothing. Simply because it is headquarters of the President, it has got importance. Similarly, Delhi is that. Otherwise it is not important. But Calcutta, Bombay, is really important city in India, big business, port, all rich men, every kind of, all cultural, everything—Calcutta, and Bombay. Originally only Calcutta, now Bombay also. Because the Britishers, they made Calcutta capital. And Calcutta was very, very important city. But these Calcutta men, they create sometimes situation, very complicated. So once in 1905 the same situation was there, politically. Sir Surendranath Bannerjee made, Surendranath Bannerjee's movement, partition of Bengal. Lord Collier, he wanted to divide Bengal, made it East Bengal and West Bengal. And Surendranath Bannerjee... He is the practically father of Indian politics. Gandhi's not. He was. He was. And in the beginning, in European circles he was famous. He was called ""Surrender-not."" The spelling of the name, s-u-r-e-n-d-e-r, Surendranath. In Parliament he was known as ""Surrender-not."" He was a very powerful politician. So there was trouble in Calcutta; so therefore they transferred, 1911, capital to Delhi. Otherwise, from the very beginning of British occupation Calcutta was the capital. You have seen the government viceroy's house near that Hamilton building where you were trying to purchase."
Haṁsadūta,The government house?,Prabhupāda," Oh yes. It is better than Buckingham Palace, such a big house."
Haṁsadūta,"Oh, the governor's house. The governor's house?",Prabhupāda," Yes, governor's house."
Haṁsadūta,It's surrounded just like a...,Prabhupāda," A big garden. Yes. That was viceroy's house. Now it is dilapidated. Otherwise, formerly it was very, very nice. Huge palace in India. Lord Collier's policy was to bring one of the princes from England and make him king of India."
Haṁsadūta,King of India.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That was his policy. He favored that policy, that Indian people are in favor of monarchy. So introduce this system: one of the royal family's son should come and become king of India. That was good suggestion. If Britishers would have ruled India for the interest of India, making one king from the royal family, it would have been great success. That policy of Lord Collier was very nice."
Haṁsadūta,That never happened.,Prabhupāda," The same thing. The parliamentary members... Just like nowadays, party. India is suffering in party politics. And they did not like to give importance to monarchy. They wanted to rule according to their whims, and therefore the whole scheme failed. The so-called democracy under party politics is nonsense. Monarchy... I have said. That day I was in remarking that ""This democracy is the government of the asses,"" because the population are asses and they vote another ass to be head of the government. So what you can do? Sayuddhe kriyate rājan sa kim asnu pahanam. These are instructions in Sanskrit. ""If you make a dog a king, don't you think that he will still lap the shoes?"" You cannot change his habits. Sva ... Yasya bhāvasya na sa sudurate kramaḥ . Anyone's habits, even if you give good position, you cannot change it. The example is just like if you make a dog the king, he will immediately come from the throne and bite the shoes. You see? So materially you cannot change. Only by spiritual understanding one can be..."
Haṁsadūta,"Canakya Pandit... I have see that book, and he says in his book that if a crow sits on a high (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," Yes. If you make a crow... The crow generally sits on the roof of the house, but that does not mean he has become a great man. ""How great I am, a very beautiful bird."""
Revatīnandana,The symbol of the Democrat party in America is the ass.,Prabhupāda, Everywhere. As soon as you...
Revatīnandana,Their symbol is an ass. They have a symbol.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Because they are asses."
Revatīnandana,"The Republican party is elephant and the Democratic party is ass, a donkey.",Prabhupāda," What is the value of vote by asses? According to Vedic civilization, there was democracy but that democracy is selected committee. Just like in England there was Privy Council. So selected body of learned brāhmaṇas and sages, they were guiding the king, and the king himself was properly educated how to rule over, under religious principles. He was trained from the beginning of his life as prince. As the future heir of the throne, he was trained, and at the same time, he was guided by a council of learned sages and brāhmaṇas. They were looking over the activities of the king. As soon as there was some mistake they will see. And there are instances; whenever there was a bad king they were dethroned. Not for political purpose. He was dethroned but his son was on the... Just like Lord Rāmacandra did. Rāmacandra killed Rāvaṇa but He never occupied the kingdom. His brother Vibhīṣaṇa proved to be faithful. He was enthroned. From the same family. And that was the system. Even a king was wrong, he would be dethroned but from his family, either his son or brother, or somebody would occupy there. Not that ""Because I have conquered you, therefore I shall sit down."" No. There are many instances. And therefore India was ruling all over the world. The emperor was in India, and the kings of different states, their family was. So there was no rebellion. And in every state a king was trained in the same process, guided by committee of learned brāhmaṇa and sages. How perfect this monarchy is. Monarchy... That Lord Collier studied that the Indian people like monarchy. Even these states, the so-called states... Now the Congress government has killed them; otherwise the Britishers were maintaining, necessary, and they were developed. Now see. The Indore was far better before. You can see from the buildings, from the whole city. It was very prosperous city. Still it is going on. So every state, the native prince, the Britishers maintained so many native prince. And because they maintained them, they were friends to the Britishers. They knew the policy, if you create zamindar, landlord. They created this aristocratic class to support them. So when Gandhi and other leaders started this movement all the princes and zamindars, they were in favor of British. Therefore it took so much time to transfer. And as a retaliation, the common people have bereft them of their kingdom. ""No more kingdom because you always supported Britishers."" It is a great politics. Therfore they have taken... The zamindars, immediately after this attainment of independence, all the zamindars and kings were bereft of their possessions. You were in Calcutta? Oh, none of you were with me. We saw one house for purchasing. That was a big zamindar's house, Tagore Thakur(?) You saw? Yes. If you have saw... How nicely it was. When they were in opulence in our childhood, oh, it was a house to be seen. There are many houses. Just like in England the lord families. In Ascot, where we stayed, that was also lord family's house. Now Yoko's house, a third-class Japanese girl. She has become the queen of the house. And how third-class, low-grade. It is the sitting room and a naked picture has... How much degraded people have become. How this man is daring to hang that picture in his sitting room so that everyone who comes sees. How much low-graded they are. They want change, but because they have no (indistinct) education they are going to the animal sphere. That is hippie movement. Yes. From animal standard they become civilized. The same story, punar muṣika bhāvaḥ . You know that story? ""Again become mouse."""
Haṁsadūta,"Oh yeah, I've heard that.",Prabhupāda," The story is a mouse came to a saintly person: ""Sir, I am in trouble. If you kindly release me?"" ""What is that trouble?"" ""A cat, they are after me. I am always at risk of life."" ""So what do you want?"" ""You also make me a cat."" ""All right. You become a cat."" Then again he came. ""Sir, again the complaint is here."" ""What is that?"" ""Dogs are chasing me."" ""Then what do you want?"" ""I want to become a dog."" ""All right. You become a dog."" In this way he came up to the tiger by the benediction of the... And when he became a tiger, he was... (snarling sound-laughter) Just like our Brahmānanda Prabhu . ""All right. Again become mouse."" You see? So these civilization is like that. They became tiger, and they are so much badly trained up that they have to become again a mouse. That is the way. That is the way of nature. If you don't improve yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you again become stool worms. The human form of life is an opportunity to come out of the cycle of birth and death, but if one does not take—these are the statements in Padma Purāṇa —then he loses the chance. They do not know what is life, how life is rotating, talking nonsense, ""I am God. Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? This is written by man."" How much low-graded people have become. They are completely under the laws of nature. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] , stringent laws of nature, and still, they are claiming, ""I am God. I am this. I am that. I am free. I am..."" And they do not mind, even they are degraded to the position of the worm of stool. But there is possibility. What is this worm of stool? It is also living entity. It is not a different thing. Paṇḍitāḥ sama - darśinaḥ [Bg. 5.18 ] . One who knows, he knows that the worm of stool and Brahmā are the same living entity. Simply under different reaction of karma one has become Brahmā and another has become the stool worm. Now we begin. [break] It is not difficult. Simply the layout should be sent to different parts, and they will make immediately plate, and that will be paper. Daily you have to send it. Eh?"
Haṁsadūta,The best place to start is Boston.,Prabhupāda," Yes, already. Even in small scale we can start from Boston."
Haṁsadūta,Just like one or two pages.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Never mind. Just like I began in that way. You have seen the...
Haṁsadūta,"Yes, I saw the original Back to Godhead. A lot of your articles were commenting about current events.",Prabhupāda," Yes. The editorial board must be very intelligent how to talk about Back to Godhead with current politics. Giriraja, you can do that?"
Giriraja,I could try.,Prabhupāda," Try. You just try it immediately. You take one newspaper and comment on the current news. Any one of you... Every one of you can do. And show me how you have given. Then you start immediately. We have got many things to do. We have Kṛṣṇa , and Kṛṣṇa is the bhoktāraṁ yajña - tapasāṁ sarva - loka maheśvaram [Bg. 5.29 ] . What these petty politicians and three acres of land? Their stage is three acres of land; our stage is the unlimited. That I have mentioned in the second volume of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . So what news they can publish? Three acres of land. We have got the innumerable universes. We can supply so much news, provided people are ready to read it. We have published so many books, they are not even able to read these books. So the other devotees, (laughs) they cannot ri..., come at five o'clock. That is the test. Yes. One who cannot rise early in the morning, he is not spiritually serious. That is test. Br ā hma- muhūrta , this hour, one hour before sunrise, is very auspicious moment."
Haṁsadūta,I can tell everyone that wants a program to come at five o'clock.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Haṁsadūta,"If somebody wants a program, I can say ""Come and see me at five o'clock."" Because after they hear you and they have maṅgala - ārati , then they will be more thoughtful about our...",Prabhupāda," Yes, tell them."
Haṁsadūta,I think that's a good idea.,Prabhupāda," You can say now, ""If anyone wants to see us, please come at five o'clock, early in the morning."" Then I shall see how much serious he is. Now I have decided to go to Delhi. Even Gurudāsa suggests rightly. All of us, we should go to Delhi."
Yamunā,"Yamunā : It might be difficult to make arrangements, Guru Mahārāja . The place where Gurudāsa is presently staying is not equipped for ten people at present. We'll have to arrange.",Prabhupāda," No, we can arrange in the Birla's house. He has a nice dharmaśāla. You know Birla's house?"
Yamunā,Yamunā : Yes. We were invited to stay there for ten days.,Prabhupāda," So that's all right. So, who invited?"
Devotee (3),One of the people connected with the temple has associated with us in Delhi and (indistinct) has invited us.,Prabhupāda," So first of all take information from the Pujari (?) in which train they have booked our seats for Delhi, and you write immediately one letter to Dhruva in Bombay and Tamal Kṛṣṇa also, that Dhruva may instruct the Delhi Birla's dharmaśāla to accommodate us immediately. So their dharmaśāla. It is Birla's dharmaśāla. First of all we have to see how they have made our seats."
Revatīnandana,So the residential place belongs to Mrs. Birla?,Prabhupāda," No, it is a temple, very big temple."
Haṁsadūta,So we should book seats for Delhi on which day?,Prabhupāda, Seventeenth.
Haṁsadūta,Seventeenth you want to leave?,Prabhupāda," Yes. What is the day, seventeenth?"
Devotee (3),Today is the fourteenth.,Prabhupāda," No, day?"
Haṁsadūta,Today is Monday.,Prabhupāda, Then?
Haṁsadūta,Seventeenth is Thursday.,Prabhupāda, Thursday?
Haṁsadūta,"Thursday, seventeenth.",Prabhupāda," So Thursday, before afternoon, we shall start."
Devotee (3),You want to go by plane Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda," No, I am asking one ticket for plane."
Devotee (3); Yamunā,You'll fly alone to Delhi?; Yamunā : The Delhi airport?,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is not difficulty. Ask Gurudāsa to take me. For two hours I can sit down. It goes direct to Delhi from here.
Devotee (3),"No, it makes two stops.",Prabhupāda, That doesn't matter.
Devotee (3),But the same plane.,Prabhupāda," Same plane. And you come, all, by train."
Haṁsadūta,Will we open a bank account here? Will we open an account in Indore?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta; Yamunā,"This morning with Mr. Holi.; Yamunā : So when we find out your arrival time, Gurudāsa, we can inform Gurudāsa when you'll be arriving?",Prabhupāda," Yes. And then the next day you come, all, by train. Thursday we can wa...? What is that Thursday?"
Haṁsadūta,Thursday,Prabhupāda," Oh, industrial house. Industrial house."
Guest (2),"It's called ""Industry House.""",Prabhupāda," Industry, that's all. Industry House. Industry House Dhruva's full name, you know?"
Devotee (3),R.C.,Prabhupāda," R.C. Dhruva , Secretary to Mr. R.D. Birla, Industry House, Church Reclamation..."
Haṁsadūta,"Bombay, West.",Prabhupāda, Bombay.
Yamunā,Yamunā : Is Parliament in session again?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yamunā; Giriraja; Yamunā,"Yamunā : I was thinking that Parliament goes in and out of session, and I wondered if they remembered this if Parliament was in session again.; No.; Yamunā : No.",Prabhupāda, Parliament is in session now?
Yamunā,Yamunā : No. Out of session now. When it's in session then all of the politicians come from their castles and (indistinct) their most of the members of Parliament (indistinct),Prabhupāda, So when the Parliament begins?
Yamunā,Yamunā : It will be (indistinct) It separates for about a month and then comes together.,Prabhupāda," Aiye. Aiye. Hare Kṛṣṇa , Hare Kṛṣṇa ..."
Giriraja,"Insofar as seeing the prime minister, this is the best time because he is not so preoccupied.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Where is that picture? There was picture you prepared.
Devotee (3),(indistinct) picture with a letter (indistinct),Prabhupāda, Oh. So... So how long you talked with the Prime Minister?
Yamunā,Yamunā : Maybe ten minutes.,Prabhupāda, So she took some interest?
Yamunā; Devotee (4),"Yamunā : She took a courteous interest. As I say, there was no doubt that at the time that she saw him she was pressed with other matters. A very personal friend of hers that Gurudāsa is now staying with told us that she was very impressed, her personal secretary was very impressed, and that she said—we have it on tape—that she would like to see us again and she was sorry that she didn't realize that we had been waiting for so long. Otherwise we could have come earlier, she would have (indistinct) In that way (indistinct) some time in the future.; In (indistinct) we saw some yogi .",Prabhupāda, Pressing nose. Nose-pressing philosophy.
Devotee (5); Yamunā,Haṭha - yoga also.; Yamunā : (indistinct),Prabhupāda, So what was his philosophy?
Yamunā,"Yamunā : You do some exercises and know God, be self-realized.",Prabhupāda," You should have said to him, ""Are you self-realized?"""
Yamunā,"Yamunā : I'm such a rascal, I didn't even try.",Prabhupāda, If they tell you then he's God...
Devotee (5); Yamunā; Devotees (5),"(indistinct) exercise and breathing (indistinct) some type of meditation performed.; Yamunā : He's social swami, a very social swami. He's very polished in a material way.; (indistinct)",Prabhupāda, And smoking also?
Yamunā; Devotee (5); Yamunā,"Yamunā : I didn't inquire into his vices.; In New York they call them ""uptown swamis.""; Yamunā : His example of spiritual life is based on material prosperity.",Prabhupāda," So why they should go to the yoga system? The science is more advanced. Before flying in the sky by a yogi he has to press his nose for so many years and the science has given us the airplane. He can purchase ticket, immediately fly. (laughter) What is use of pressing nose?"
Yamunā,Yamunā : You explain that in Bhāgavatam .,Prabhupāda," Yes. What is the use, wasting time?"
Revatīnandana,"(indistinct) about when you walk on the water, walking on the water is a bogus thing (indistinct) two cent yogi because for two cents he could have taken (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," That's all. If that is the ultimate end of life, to walk on the water or to fly in the sky, so science has given them all opportunity. And the material science is so advanced, that all this yoga system is now almost accomplished because that is material only, material prosperity. Aiye."
Yamunā,Yamunā : (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes, eating flesh sumptuously and get fat. Flesh-eaters get fatty very quickly, flesh-eaters. Māṁsa . The skin becomes increased for flesh-eating. You see in your country, the Russia? Russian beauty-big belly, fat. That..."
Yamunā,Yamunā : Germans are like that too. Germans.,Prabhupāda," Germans. If you eat meat, you very quickly can get fat. Also too much ghee also. That is also. But ghee will increase your belly only. Just the Marwaris... (laughter) But by eating flesh you'll get sturdy, good lump of muscles. That is... In Āyur- Veda there is a chapter which is called Dravya - guṇa . There is a book, Dravya - guṇa . So they have analyzed so many different kinds of flesh-birds, beasts, animals. How they have analyzed? That ""If you eat this kind flesh you will get this kind of result."" Hundreds of fleshes. What do they know? They can eat only cow's flesh or dog's flesh or hog's flesh. Yes. But there are so many, even birds, beasts, animals, and so many, analysis. And Bernard Shaw, I think, he wrote one book, ""You Are What You Eat."""
Haṁsadūta,George Bernard Shaw.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So they are becoming animals, animals eating animal flesh. Bernard Shaw was vegetarian."
Devotee (6),Except he would take liver for his health.,Prabhupāda, Liver?
Devotee (6),Yes. He used to take some liver periodically for his health.,Prabhupāda, Medicine. There are many liver extract preparations.
Devotee (6),"No, not liver extract. Maybe. I don't know exactly. But I know he used to take liver. Not cod liver oil or anything.",Prabhupāda," No, liver extract preparations there are many medicines. For anemic patient liver extract is recommended."
Devotee (6),That's all right for us to take?,Prabhupāda," No, but if you are going to die, then you can take."
Yamunā,Yamunā : Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," When required for such trouble, if you are going to die, then, to save yourself, you can."
Devotee (6),If that liver can be eaten raw...,Prabhupāda," If you are going to die. Not ordinary. If it is clear that without liver extract you shall die, you can take."
Devotee (4),You cannot tell. You can't tell until you actually (indistinct),Prabhupāda, Because when there is question of death it is recommended you may take anything to save your life.
Yamunā,Yamunā : Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," But those who are rigid, they are prepared to die even."
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Vaiṣṇavas, wouldn't they just chant?",Prabhupāda," Their proposal is ""Death is sure today or tomorrow, so why shall I change my principles? Death will take place even if I live for ten years more, and what is the benefit? Why shall I change my principles? It is not that by taking that medicine or liver extract I shall be amara , immortal."" That is not possible. If somebody gives some medicine that one can make himself immortal, that is another thing. Nobody is going to be immortal. Why he should be afraid of death? Death will take place. ""As sure as death."" So today, or tomorrow, or hundred years after. So if one moment is utilized for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that makes life successful. Why shall I live for hundred years, waste my time? One moment is sufficient for living."
Himāvatī,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? I just have one question about the ending, that Ajāmila , he was calling the name of his youngest son.",Prabhupāda, Nārāyaṇa .
Himāvatī,"He was thinking but he was calling out to him, and after calling, he was reminded of his early life, of his worshiping the real Nārāyaṇa .",Prabhupāda, Nārāyaṇa .
Himāvatī,And therefore Nārāyaṇa saved him. Isn't that true?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Himāvatī,Not that he was simply calling and Nārāyaṇa had to save him...,Prabhupāda," But simply calling, ""Nārāyaṇa,"" he reminded, he remembered. Remembered. Yes."
Himāvatī,He remembered the real Nārāyaṇa .,Prabhupāda," Because actually when one chants Lord Kṛṣṇa's name, Lord's name, immediately he remembers Lord's form, activities, pastimes, everything. That is natural."
Himāvatī,"Not that he was unconsciously just chanting and the Lord saved him in that way, but he actually remembered the Lord.",Prabhupāda," That is the remark of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. But according to others' opinion, even simply by chanting, that is sufficient. In the Bhāgavata it is stated like that. But Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has remarked that this chanting referred to the context. Immediately he remembered Nārāyaṇa ."
Himāvatī,"In that same connection, the story of Ṭhākura Haridāsa and the harlot. She began to chant and told him the reason that she was a prostitute, she was no good and simply by that association she began to chant or by previous association...",Prabhupāda," No, by association. By the influence of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. For three days, three days she associated."
Himāvatī,But Professor Sanyal was putting forward his theory that in previous lives she had had association; therefore she began to chant.,Prabhupāda, Why previous lives? That's not very good reason.
Himāvatī,"Subconscious, that she had subconsciously remembered.",Prabhupāda," No, no. No, no. That is not."
Himāvatī,In one of the Back to Godhead magazines,Prabhupāda, That is not. He advocates that.(?) Direct association with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Why previously?
Himāvatī,We want to say that previously she had done some chanting.,Prabhupāda, We don't find any such thing. Professor Sanyal was not very much advanced. He committed so many blunders.
Himāvatī,You heard about that article?,Prabhupāda, No.
Himāvatī,That was the (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Well, if that sort of remark is given it is not against the śāstra , but it was not necessarily previously. His direct association... Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,"
Revatīnandana,Does that also apply to reading the words of a pure devotee?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Revatīnandana,Even a little association with your books has the same effect?,Prabhupāda," Effect, of course, it requires both the things. One must be very eager to take it. Just like Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , and there are so many others. They are also reading Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . So Mahārāja Parīkṣit was very serious. So both things should be serious. Just like the example: the husband and wife must be potent; then there is pregnancy. Otherwise there is no pregnancy. So sewing the seed, the field also must be fertile or receptive, then the seed will fructify. It is reciprocal."
Revatīnandana,"If the seed starts to sprout and it lacks sufficient facilities, then it will die completely.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Revatīnandana,"But if a spiritual seed sprouts, then whatever sprout is made is never lost. Right?",Prabhupāda," Yes. It is not lost, but it is checked. Sometimes he is checked."
Revatīnandana,Because the tendency to revive again.,Prabhupāda," In that way again one has to... That brings the question of previous life. One was advanced so much; it was checked by some reason; he again begins from that point. Just like Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura was advanced in his previous life up to bhava - bhakti . Somehow or other, it was checked. But as soon as he heard the words from the prostitute, ""Oh, you are so much after the flesh and similar, and bones and skin. If you had been so much eager for Kṛṣṇa , how you would have been disposed,"" immediately he came to that point and immediately left. I'll take (devotees offer obeisances)"
Devotee (6),"Śrīla Prabhupāda? The other day you talked about the spirit soul and his position in the brahmajyoti, that there's no shelter there. Just like we go up, up, up into the sky (indistinct) there's no shelter there so you have to go to some planet. So I was thinking that the reason why our position is shaky is due to this body, but spirit, being restless can remain anywhere...",Prabhupāda," Yes, but there the shelter is transcendental bliss. The impersonal Brahman is not transcendental bliss. It is simply eternity. But we want three things: eternity, full knowledge, and blissful life. So there is no bliss."
Devotee (6),Yes. Just as we require shelter because we have the body...,Prabhupāda," Yes. So similarly, this living entity also requires shelter of blissful life. That is this association of Kṛṣṇa . So unless he gets that, he wants blissfulness, but—there is some spiritual blissfulness; he has no information—he comes down again to this perverted blissfulness of this material world."
Devotee (6),They don't take their pleasure in being there in the brahmajyoti?,Prabhupāda," There is no pleasure. Blissfulness is not there, brahmajyoti is simply eternity, that's all. The same example can be given. Just like sunlight. There is only light. But on a planet the effect of the light is there—there are so many trees, so many flowers, fruits. We, we want varieties of pleasure. Variety is the mother of..."
devotees,"""Variety is the spice of life.""",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Himāvatī,Spice of life.,Prabhupāda," Oh. Yes. So therefore, we are living entities, life. We want variety. So this is the varietyless, no variety, one kind, sunlight. We require sunlight. We are so much anxious for sunlight. Not only sunlight."
Revatīnandana,It must get very boring. It is very boring in the brahmajyoti ? You get very bored? There is nothing to do? Nowhere to go?,Prabhupāda, Bore?
Haṁsadūta,"Boring, dull.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Himāvatī,"But at first they are satisfied, aren't they, that they've achieved their goal?",Prabhupāda," Aviśuddha - buddhayaḥ [ SB 10.2.32 ] . They do not know. They are after brahmaṇanda , transcendental pleasure, but they do not know what is actually transcendental pleasure, impersonalists. Therefore their intelligence is not clean. They go to the spiritual kingdom, transcendental platform, but they do not that know, how real transcendental pleasure can be achieved. Therefore their knowledge is not perfect."
Revatīnandana,"When they want to come back, is it very easy for them to come back or have they got to...?",Prabhupāda," No, they automatically come back because he is hankering after varieties. So that variety is not there, so he is attracted again in the material world. Just like so many sannyāsīs. Take Vivekananda. He wanted to lecture on Vedānta , which is liberation. He came again back to the hospitalizing and philanthropic work because he could not find the variety of pleasure in Vedānta . Of course, he was not very much advanced. There are many. There is a... Sannyāsī is here. he's a Kārpātrī (?). He is very learned and other... He was formerly speaking on Vedānta and other... Now he is in politics and cow protection. You see? There are many."
Revatīnandana,"I have a hazy memory that one time I heard that when a soul, when it finally does enter into brahmajyoti, that he has to remain there for some long duration of time, a daytime of Brahmā or a lifetime of Brahmā . Is that correct? What is that duration?",Prabhupāda, Not that. That is not like that.
Revatīnandana,Not like that. Thank you.,Prabhupāda," But he feels inconvenience without varieties of life. The Bhāgavata says, tvayy asta -bhāvād aviśuddha - buddhayaḥ : ""Their intelligence is not clean."" Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ : [SB 10.2.32 ] ""Although they rise up to the brahmajyoti,"" patanty adho tataḥ , ""they again come back."""
Haṁsadūta,And the nirvāṇa conception of life is just before Brahman ?,Prabhupāda, Nirvāṇa conception is marginal position between brahmajyoti and this material world.
Haṁsadūta,Just on the brink.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Kāraṇārṇava. Kāraṇārṇava. The Kāraṇa Ocean wherefrom the beginning of creation, material creation, that is nirvāṇa ."
Devotee (4),Virajā .,Prabhupāda," Virajā , yes."
Revatīnandana,Is it possible to go there?,Prabhupāda, Why not? Yes.
Devotee (4),Arjuna went there.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Revatīnandana,What was Arjuna's purpose?,Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa took him to show His friend. He did not go alone. That he could not. No. (laughter) It was Kṛṣṇa's chariot.
Revatīnandana,So he went to the spiritual sky?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Then what is the use of making friendship with Kṛṣṇa if you cannot do so? There was a rich man in Calcutta, Motilal Sill. He was so rich that... Every man has different circle in younger days. So he would see. If any of his friends did not possess a house in Calcutta, he would purchase house. He said that, ""If people say, 'Oh, you are friend of Motilal Sill. You have no your own house?' what people will say about me? He must have his own house."" He purchased house for him. He was very big man. And there are many incidences also like, a very noble story. Actually it was not long ago, say about hundred years ago. He would not see that any one of his associates, friends, does not possess a house in Calcutta. Another Kṛṣṇa's friend, Sudama also. (chuckles) He could not recognize his own place, how it had happened, palatial buildings, garden. In Kṛṣṇa , you have not read Sudama? Give me water."
Yamunā,"Yamunā : (indistinct) mentions in the Teachings of Lord Caitanya that a devotee in attachment selects one of the Vṛndāvana ..., the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana , and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful in his own devotional service. Does that mean that one of our spiritual masters is an eternal representative of Vṛndāvana ? (indistinct)",Prabhupāda, What is that? Let me...
Yamunā,"Yamunā : It says, ""All inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi, Vṛndāvana , are very dear to Kṛṣṇa . A devotee in attachment selects one of the inhabitants and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful.""",Prabhupāda," Devotee... Devoted to the Vṛndāvana inhabitants. You don't directly think of yourself that ""I shall see Kṛṣṇa as my son."""
Yamunā,Yamunā : No.,Prabhupāda, No.
Yamunā,Yamunā : No.,Prabhupāda, That is Māyāvāda .
Yamunā,Yamunā : Yes.,Prabhupāda, You have to follow the footsteps of Yasoda Ma .
Yamunā,Yamunā : Yes. You've told me that before.,Prabhupāda, Then it will be success.
Revatīnandana,"But you've said that you are always in Vṛndāvana , so we are following a Vṛndāvana inhabitant.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (laughter)
Yamunā,"Yamunā : It says, ""One should always remember the activities of that particular inhabitant of Vraja .""",Prabhupāda, Now you have got Kapoor(?) daughter?
Devotee (4); Revatīnandana,Yes.; Have we got an engagement this morning?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Haṁsadūta,He asked if we have an engagement this morning. 8:30.,Prabhupāda," Oh, Molpar(?), yes. They'll send car?"
Yamunā,Yamunā : Yes.,Prabhupāda, How far it is?
Haṁsadūta,It's supposed to be just in the neighborhood.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that's all. He was formerly prince."
Revatīnandana,Of this area?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,He had given (indistinct),Prabhupāda, That is the sign of princely opulence.
Revatīnandana,He's the son of the man we saw last week? This Mahārāja ? It's not his son?,Prabhupāda," No, no, he is also old man."
Haṁsadūta,I won't be going to that place because I'll be waiting for Mr. Homing.,Prabhupāda, Homing is coming?
Haṁsadūta,Yes. (indistinct) we'll open a bank account.,Prabhupāda, That's it.
Haṁsadūta,We'll open a one-sided account.,Prabhupāda," Book fund account and one, International Society, checking account. (devotees offer obeisances) So what we have to do in that connection?"
Devotee (4),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, The water? [break] Where is your son? (Hindi) This is material conception. (Hindi) (end)
Guest (1),(indistinct),Prabhupāda," That's all right but do not take the position of a teacher unless you have assimilated the whole thing. Simply by hearing others you may misunderstand, you may not present the real thing. Therefore I'm asking you..."
Guest (1),(indistinct),Prabhupāda," (Hindi) (indistinct) but you must know. Another thing is that you must know Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam from a bhāgavata , whose life is bhāgavata . First of all you must know what is bhāgavata . What is bhāgavata ? Can you give me idea what you have understood? Instead of going through the instruction, first of all let me understand what do you understand about this (indistinct) Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . That is essential. So you cannot explain what is Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . You have read Bhāgavatam from the beginning? Dharma projjhita kaitavo atra . You have read?"
Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Eh? You have not read even the first verse and you are going to give instruction on Bhāgavatam ? Your life should be bhāgavata . You should understand what is bhāgavata . Simply by (indistinct) words from others how can you accept?
Guest (1),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Huh ? So I bless(?) you that you try to understand. Then you write. That is my request. (end)
Guest (1) (Indian man),"Māyāvādīs may die like that, imagining... (Hindi) Ara saba bhṛtya .",Prabhupāda," Yes. They are after, inquiring after Brahmān , but nobody could give them. So they have got it. Now they are taking it. This is stage. (Hindi) That is the stage, sannyāsa stage. So these hippies, they are also giving up all work, that is sannyāsa , but there is no guide. There is no guide. And because they have no guide, therefore their intelligence is not being purified. Simply there is a propensity for renunciation, tyāga . But tyāga ... (Hindi) After renunciation, what is the next stage, they do not know. That we are giving: ""Yes, come here. Stand here."" (laughs) Is it not?"
Haṁsadūta,Yes. Exactly.,Prabhupāda," They are very successful. They are standing: ""We don't want this."" But they must stand. So they could not give the standing. But here is... Oh, here is standing. Therefore this movement is successful. They want some standing. And where is the standing? (Hindi) So unless you get a solid ground you cannot stand. You'll fall down."
Guest (2) (Indian man),(Hindi),Prabhupāda," Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ . Kirāṭa -huṇāndhra-pulin... Huh ? (Hindi) [break] ...obeisance to guru . Then his guru , then his guru , up to Kṛṣṇa . (Hindi) ... paramparā system. You cannot directly approach God. That is useless. You have no power to approach God directly. That is not possible. Guru kṛṣṇa kṛpayā [ Cc. Madhya 19.151 ] . (Hindi) Let them study this philosophy. We have got books, enough books. One cannot read all these books even throughout whole life. [break]"
Guest (2),I am going to...,Prabhupāda, (Hindi) You do actually work.
Guest (2),So I can also accompany certain places like...,Prabhupāda, You arrange. We can go there with all party. Now here in this part... You can get. This... Immediately we can go. From India...
Guest (2),"From India, yes.",Prabhupāda, We can go to Indonesia.
Guest (2),At the end of March we can go there.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. You also come. Arrange like that. After finishing our program in Simla, let us go to Indonesia. You do it."
Guest (2),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, That is a fact. At least at the present moment nobody can give better thing than what I am giving to the world. (Hindi)
Guest (2),There are many things you can give us. I'll arrange the tour.,Prabhupāda," You are present, a tourist program here?"
Guest (2),I was there. I...,Prabhupāda, So this program...
Guest (2),I wanted to join with the camp in the public but nobody was convenienced...,Prabhupāda," No, you could have informed him. You could come to the pal... Anyway, next, next, tomorrow also we'll have."
Guest (2); Hamsadutta; Guest (2),"I no way want to disturb...; No, you won't disturb. You'll enhance us.; Tomorrow I'll come.",Prabhupāda," Where you are staying here? [break] ...actually inquisitive, he'll capture it. It is not the question of... Japan . [break] ...personal ambition. It is service to Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa wants. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ [Bg. 18.66 ] . So we are canvassing."
Guest (2),(indistinct),Prabhupāda," That word, that brahma - jijñāsā , that is the position of the whole world. Yes, that is the position. They have enough seen about this material nonsense. Now that is the position. They want to know what is this Brahman ."
Guest (2),It is called Treta - yuga .,Prabhupāda," No, this is not this yuga . This is called Kali - yuga . But... Then it will come, Satya - yuga . And that is long, long after, 400,000's of years after. (laughs) Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . (end)"
Haṁsadūta,Ah...,Prabhupāda, He is puzzled.
Devotee (1),I am puzzled.,Prabhupāda," (chuckles) Just try to understand this philosophy. If when I see practically my father has got head, his father has got head, his father has got head, head, head, head... Go on. And the ultimate father, why he has no head? What this poor person, gentleman, has done that he has no head? (laughter) This is... This nonsense theory is going on, that ""God has no head. God has no legs. God has no hand."" Imperson means He has no head, no leg, no... That means... And somebody says, ""He is dead,"" and ""void."""
Revatinandana,They're trying to kill Kṛṣṇa . They're trying to kill Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," That's all. That is their business. Rākṣasa , asura , miscreants, rogues, fools, rascals—that is their business. Envious. Because they are... If I say that ""You have no eyes,"" that means indirectly I say that ""You are blind."" If I say that ""You have no leg,"" indirectly I say, ""You are lame."" In this way, when I deny your senses, that means I am calling God by ill names that ""You are blind. You are lame. You are headless. You are rascal,"" like that. And that is their prayer. Calling God by ill names, that is their prayer. What do you think, Girirāja?"
Girirāja,"Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. When you say, ""O my Lord, You have no leg, You have no hand, You have no eyes,"" that means, ""You are blind, You are lame, You are headless,"" (laughter) ""You have no sense""—""You are nonsense."" So this is prayer. This is their prayer. So we have to fight vigorously with these rascal impersonalists and voidists. When I was talking, somebody left the meeting in the morning. Yes. That means he could not tolerate (laughs) all these designations-rascal, miscreants, lowest of the mankind. Yes."
Devotee (2),"In this mantra of Śrī Upaniṣad , Mantra Twelve,",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),Then why is it seen that they are making spiritual advancement?,Prabhupāda," No, they don't make any spiritual advancement. They come down. Don't you see this impersonalist, Vivekananda? He took sannyāsa ; he came to hospital-making, came back. They are not advancing. They are coming back, falling down. While they have no engagement in devotional service, they say, ""Oh, why you are finding God anywhere? Here is God, daridra - nārāyaṇa , these poor men."" That's it. That is not advancement. They are coming down. Now, they come down and they defame Nārāyaṇa , that ""Nārāyaṇa has become daridra ."" He has found Nārāyaṇa is daridra ."
Revatinandana,What is that word?,Prabhupāda," Daridra . Daridra means poor, poor. Daridra - nārāyaṇa . This is manufactured word by Vivekananda. They are so proud that ""When a beggar comes at your door, you should treat him as Nārāyaṇa , daridra ."" These are simply high-sounding words. What they are doing actually for the daridras?"
Revatinandana,So that is service in the mode of ignorance.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Revatinandana,That is service in the mode of ignorance?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. They cannot serve. All these welfare activities of the world, what they are serving? That I explained this morning. They are trying to give help to the poor, but the number of poor is increasing. They are trying to give medicine or relief to the suffering patients. The patients are increasing. Hospitals are increasing. But if our number of temples, Kṛṣṇa temples is increase, that is something sound. But they are increasing hospitals. What do you think? If we increase number of hospitals, does it mean that we are making progress? But they think that they are making progress. Just like in your country there is welfare department? The expenditure increasing."
Revatinandana,"Yes, (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," That means the social structure is very bad. Otherwise, natural procedure is that everyone should be self-independent. But why state has to give them help? That's not good. You may be... Just like a son may be very rich man's son, but if the father provides him only, then he's a useless son. Is it not? If the father has to provide him money for his maintenance, then that son is useless son. That is not a good certificate. Although you may be very much proud that ""I am maintaining my so many sons,"" why you should maintain? Let them be self-supported."
Yadubara,But what can the state do? Should the state just leave the people alone?,Prabhupāda," No. They should make the citizens so nicely developed in their Kṛṣṇa consciousness that they should be self-dependent, self-satisfied. That is the ideal of civilization."
Yadubara,But America is so far from that.,Prabhupāda," Therefore it is not advancement, although they are very much proud of advancement. This is not sign of advancement. According to Bhagavad- gītā it is said, yasmin sthite guruṇāpi duḥkhena na vicālyate : [ Bg . 6.20 -23] ""If one is situated in such a position that even in the greatest, gravest type of dangerous position, he is not agitated, he is not agitated, that is the real happiness."" Yasmin sthite guruṇāpi duḥkhena na vicālyate . These are the words, yasmin sthite : ""Situated in such a position that although he is facing greatest danger, he is not agitated."" There is one instance. Not very long ago, say, about two hundred years ago there was a big zamindar. He was known as king in Krishnanagar. So he was charitably disposed. He went to a brāhmaṇa and asked him—he was a great learned scholar—""Can I help you any way?"" And the pandit replied, ""No. I don't require your help. I am quite satisfied."" ""How you are satisfied?"" ""Oh, my, these students, they bring some rice. So my wife boils that, and I have got this tamarind tree. I take some leaves and prepare some juice out of it. That is sufficient."" So he was satisfied. That's all. But he was a learned scholar. Similarly, Canakya Pandit... You have perhaps heard. He was the greatest politician. He was prime minister of India. He was living in a cottage and just giving instruction. So that is India's Vedic civilization. Everyone is satisfied, self-sufficient. And now in your country, oh, you have to attend office fifty miles off. And because you have to take this trouble, Kṛṣṇa has provided with car. You are thinking, ""I am advanced."" You don't think that ""Although I have got car, I have to go fifty miles off from my home."" This is illusion. You are thinking, ""I am advanced. I am happy. I have got this car."" This is illusion. Yes. Gaurasundara was going to maintain, and he drives fifty miles off, Honolulu. The poor fellow had to rise early in the morning. You see? And so much haste .(?) Therefore: ""Gaurasundara, you better give up this job. Just depend on Kṛṣṇa ."" So he has given up. What is this? Fifty miles going by motorcycle or motor car, how much tedious it is. But still, they are satisfied that ""We are advanced."" And because they have many cars, therefore in your country always there is that (makes traffic noise), ""sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh,"" wherever I go."
Revatinandana,And more problems come after that.,Prabhupāda," Simply, wherever you go, (makes traffic noise) ""sonh, sonh, sonh, sonh,"" and ""gonh, gonh, gonh, gonh, gonh."" Up in the sky, ""gonh, gonh, gonh, gonh,"" and in the street, ""sonh, sonh..."" And then, when digging, ""gut-gut-gut-gut-gut-gut-gut-gut-gut!"" (laughter) Is it not? Don't you feel botheration. But they are thinking, ""Oh, America is very much advanced in machine."" And when there is that garbage tank? ""Ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon-ghon!"" (laughter) So many sounds are going on, always. Eh? Of course, you have got very nice city, nice roads everywhere. But this trouble... You have created so many troubles. And there are news that one lady was a patient. She became mad for the sounds. And I think they are thinking very seriously how to stop all these sounds. Is it not?"
Śyāmasundara,Especially they have these airplanes now.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Śyāmasundara,They make such a tremendous sound that they break windows and everything else.,Prabhupāda," Now we are with Sambhu in Bombay. As soon as the aeroplane would come on top of the house it is just like thunderbolt. Yes. At least I was feeling like that. Vajrapa. You see? So this is called illusion. We are creating a civilization which is so much painful, but we are thinking that we are advanced. This is illusion. We are creating simply problems, and still, we are thinking that we are advanced. And Bhāgavata says that there is no problem. Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ [ SB 1.5.18 ] . You simply try for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And then how I shall live? That, the answer, is tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham . Just like you don't aspire for miseries, but it comes upon you, it is forced upon you, similarly, happiness also will be forced upon you, whatever you are destined to receive. So don't try for happiness or discarding distress. That will go on. You simply try for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which, without your trying, it will never be fulfilled. You have to voluntarily try for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, revive it. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . You do it—because you have to do it. Kṛṣṇa can force you to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. But He doesn't do that. He doesn't interfere with your independence. He says, ""Do it."" Therefore you have to try for it, not for other things. Other things, already there are. For the birds and beasts there is no problem for eating. Why your problem should be? Just like a prisoner. He has no problem for eating. The government supplies. He has only problem that he should not be criminal. That is his problem. He should try for that: ""No more I shall become a criminal."" That is the real activity. But he thinks... If in the prisonhouse you say, ""What shall I eat?"" no, eating is already there. Even you are a prisoner, the government has supplied his eating. Similarly, God has supplied everyone, cats and dogs, for eating. Why not for you? You have created your own problem. Real problem is how to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ [ SB 1.5.18 ] . Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that."
Yadubara,These problems will take care of themselves if people develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yadubara,Then there is no need to deal with the problem then.,Prabhupāda," There is no problem. At least we Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we have no problem for eating. Is it? Is there any problem?"
Haṁsadūta,There's problem. Eating too much!,Prabhupāda," (laughs) This is practical. If you have any problem, you join us. You will have no problem for eating. That I can guarantee you. Wherever you go, you shall eat sumptuously. Yes."
Devotee (3),Is it all right to finish rounds(?) in the temple when there's nothing to do?,Prabhupāda, No.
Devotee (3),This afternoon.,Prabhupāda, Not afternoon. You have to do it in the morning when there is nothing.
Guest (1),Hare Kṛṣṇa !,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . (Hindi) Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Devotee (4),He danced on saṅkīrtana today.,Prabhupāda," Perhaps in other engagement he cannot dance. Actually there is no problem. Why there should be problem? There are 8,400,000 species of life. Out of that, human being are 400... Out of that, 80%, they are uncivilized. So all these living entities have no problem for eating. This 20% or 15% people who are called as civilized, they have problem. They have created problem. At least in India, say, hundred years before, there was no problem for eating, even for the śūdra class or any... No, there was no... The society was so made, there was no problem. Why fifty years? In 1933 or '36 in Vṛndāvana somebody wanted milk, some pilgrimage amongst ourselves. So went to a house. So, ""Can you supply us some milk?"" ""Ah, how much you want?"" So it was about ten pounds. So she supplied immediately, one woman, and when she was offered price, ""Oh, why shall I take a price for ten or twenty pounds of milk? Oh, you can take it."" That is my practical experience. Milk was so freely available. So simply we are creating problems by godless civilization. That is a fact."
Haṁsadūta,"Once you said we are making solutions to self-created problems, and we think it's advancement.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,We've created a big thing and then make so many solutions.,Prabhupāda," Just like we just take example from your country. You are constructing so many highways, freeways. Still, there is problem. Still, even in the highways, sometimes blocked. Aiye. (Hindi) Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido [ SB 1.5.18 ] . (Hindi) We do not dissuade persons to stop work. No. That is not our... You do your work, but be Kṛṣṇa conscious. That's it. Just like Arjuna . Arjuna was a fighter. Kṛṣṇa never stopped him from his occupation, but he was taught Kṛṣṇa conscious even in the battlefield. (Hindi—break) You want to see? Yes. Where is that book?"
Haṁsadūta,"Here, Bhagavad- gītā .",Prabhupāda," Kiñcid adhīta . [break] ...a thousand pages of this size. This is four hundred pages, but that Gītā will be thousand pages. But we shall use very thin paper. Yes. It is available after some time."
Guest (2),Where?,Prabhupāda, In our center in India.
Guest (2),Is this same?,Prabhupāda," No, it is Nectar of Devotion. Where are our other books?"
Haṁsadūta,In my suitcase. Shall I bring them?,Prabhupāda," Yes, bring. [break] Kṛṣṇa , canvassing Himself, says, Kṛṣṇa , Himself canvassing, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . ""Give up everything. Just surrender unto Me."" How many do it? So we are canvassing on behalf of Kṛṣṇa . He personally said practically. So you don't expect that everyone will be Kṛṣṇa conscious. It is very difficult."
Haṁsadūta; Prahupada; Haṁsadūta,Yes.; So why not give everyone.; Everyone?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (3); Haṁsadūta,"Do you practice meditation in your center?; Our meditation consists of chanting the holy name of God. Or, in fact, we are always absorbed in meditating because whatever we do, we do on behalf of Kṛṣṇa . So our mind, which is the center of our activities, is always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa . The principle of meditation is to fix up our mind on Kṛṣṇa . Just like Kṛṣṇa says, ""Always think of Me. Become My devotee. Bow down to Me. Worship Me. Give your love to Me. In this way, you will come to Me."" So if we want to go to Kṛṣṇa ...",Prabhupāda," That is the highest, topmost type of yoga . Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad - gata āntarātmanā, śraddhāvān bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo mataḥ : [Bg. 6.47 ] ""Anyone,"" Kṛṣṇa says, ""who is thinking of Me always within his heart, with devotion and love, he is the topmost yogi ."" Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ . So this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, as soon as you chant Kṛṣṇa and hear it, immediately you think of. And the chanting is not done by any ordinary man. Unless one has love and devotion for Kṛṣṇa , he cannot chant. You just study with this verse. Śraddhāvān bhajate yo mam , āntarātmanā: ""Within, he is topmost."" So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are training people to become the topmost yogis."
Guest (3),Do they have to practice every day?,Prabhupāda," The practice is very simple. Anyone, when you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , even child joins. Even a small child, he also claps and joins. Therefore it is recommended in the śāstras, harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma iva kevalam , kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] . In this age nobody can meditate actually. It is very difficult. Maybe one or two persons can meditate, but that is not for all. But here Kṛṣṇa conscious, the chanting, is so nice, that even a child can take part. It doesn't require that he should be educated, he should be rich or he should be enlightened, no. As he is, simply if he takes part in this... Even woman. We were chanting. There was some roaring. As soon as we begin chanting, it stopped. This is authorized. This is recommended. And this is practically being... Now in European and American countries, four or five years back..."
Guest (3),"Chanting is mental concentration, is it?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Chanting and hearing, locked up. Mind is locked up. And because the Kṛṣṇa vibration is locked up, then Kṛṣṇa is locked up, because there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His name, absolute. Kṛṣṇa is absolute. Therefore there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His name, His form, His pastimes."
Guest (3),"What is the trance that... The meditation, trance enters. It is called...",Prabhupāda," Trance is... The actual meditation means concentrate one's mind on Viṣṇu form. That is real meditation. But now they have, the impersonalists and voidists, they have manufactured so many things, but actual meditation means..."
Guest (3),Transcendental meditation. Trans...?,Prabhupāda, Transcendental meditation. The transcendental meditation means to think of Lord Viṣṇu .
Guest (3),These books will be available where?,Prabhupāda," These books are... Now we have some custom difficulty. Books are lying in the port, but we have some custom clearance permission difficulty. Just this morning we have received news from Delhi. Now everything is complete. So now we shall get the books, say, within a fortnight."
Guest (3),Within a fortnight.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (3),"In Surat, unable to permanently enter in Surat?",Prabhupāda," Yes. If you give us some place, we'll immediately open. Just like in Indore we had been. Somebody has given us a land. Not only land, but they are going to prepare a temple also there. And the residential quarters, we shall arrange to construct. So this land is about 400,000 square feet."
Guest (3),In Surat?,Prabhupāda," No, in Indore. Yes. So if we get place, we can start. Our program is international. And it is not difficult for us. We can start a branch even underneath a tree. We begin... I began in New York like that. I was chanting underneath a tree in a park. Yes."
Guest (4),(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. To the members, not to the public. It is very difficult for import-export, and sales tax, this, that, so many botherations government has created. Therefore our proposal is that... Thank you. We don't sell. No. Simply who becomes a member, we give him. You give us something, and whatever we have got, we give you. Business finished. Not finished, but business established. (laughs) Then if you read our books, if you inquire, then we get opportunity to explain. And our distribution of books means that is indirectly propagating our mission. Yes. So therefore we have adopted this way, that only to the members. That's all. We have printed that ""These books are not for sale in India."" Yes. Because the government machine is so implicated- sale tax, this tax, that tax..."
Guest (3),I want to put in India also.(?) They are for sale there.(?),Prabhupāda, Because there we have no difficulty.
Haṁsadūta; Guest (3),There's difficulty with the authorities.; Not in India. You can sell to Indians.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. We are selling."
Haṁsadūta; Guest (3),"America, Japan .; You can sell, but not in India.",Prabhupāda," No, India, we can sell, but as soon as we sell, oh, there are so many impediments, this tax... We cannot trust.(?) That is next. When we see that we have got enough members, so this money which you pay for our membership, this will be utilized for starting press and reprinting books. Yes. But another difficulty is this class of high class printing you cannot have in India. No. You have seen our Kṛṣṇa Book and Teachings of Lord Caitanya ? Any books. Eh?"
Guest (3),In Bombay you can get.,Prabhupāda," No. We took quotation from Times of India press about our, this Back to Godhead magazine. They quoted, ""Two rupees, twelve annas,"" cost price. Now at what price we shall sell?"
Guest (3),This will be very costly.,Prabhupāda," Very costly here. And even if we pay, this nature, this type of book, is very difficult to be printed in India, such nice paper, printing."
Haṁsadūta,"Even on U.S. standards, these books, although they retail for eight dollars each, they are worth at least twenty dollars. If you purchase a book of this quality... Generally art books come like this, with many color illustrations, and they charge twenty dollars.",Prabhupāda, Here you have seen that letter? Five?
Guest (4),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Is it all right?
Guest (4); Guest (5),Yes.; I think it never comes here.,Prabhupāda," Naturally, he wrote that, said, ""I gave it to such and such."" It will go like that. Yes? Why Overseas(?) should keep so much account? You do not know, whatever you take, and that is returned or not. No, whatever you take, you should see that it is returned. Now you are asking how much. What is that? You take and you ask him. Where is that small... What is called? Victoria?(?) You brought it back? You took from there but got it back? You got it back? You took from there one shirt, one dhotī, one victo...(?)"
Devotee (5),Yesterday I did.,Prabhupāda, You got it?
Devotee (5),"No, I couldn't find it.",Prabhupāda," You have to find there? After reminding me? After reminding you? Why do you not...? Whatever you give, you must see that it is returned. When I inquire where it is now, you say, ""I shall see."" There are so many clothings. How they can keep the account? You should know how much you have delivered and how much you have taken back. Who took? Find out. How it is struggle. Then? Let us prepare."
Devotee (5),Kṛṣṇa's in control. Here are some letters. [break],Prabhupāda, ...I dictated yesterday. It is not yet sent out. (end)
