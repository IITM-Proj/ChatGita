Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Questions were intelligent. So all these frustrated boys and girls in the Western world, they are all good candidate. You have to organize to give them; they are searching after."
Śyāmasundara,It seems like that it's the nature of all living entities to be mad after something.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Love. That I explained—love. We have got our love in store. But instead of loving Kṛṣṇa , we have distributed the love in so many ways, and frustrated. Love is there in store. That is reserved for Kṛṣṇa . And we are trying to love Kṛṣṇa , that I explained. Why I am loving this body and this apartment? Ultimately he goes to Kṛṣṇa . But that you do not know. You are actually trying to love Kṛṣṇa . But because nobody is giving him Kṛṣṇa , he's crying."
Śyāmasundara,"That was the name of Allen Ginsberg's first book, Howl.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,Howl .,Prabhupāda, Howa?
Śyāmasundara,"Howl. That means it was a protest, a howling, ""You have not given us the right information,"" to his elders. ""Now what do we do? Simply howl."" That was the introduction for our generation, and we all listened to that, read that, the howl protest.",Prabhupāda," He is also searching after; therefore he comes. Whenever he finds opportunity, he comes to me. He's searching after Kṛṣṇa ."
Śyāmasundara,Yes. He gets so many bogus ideas. (laughs),Prabhupāda, (chuckles) But still he's attached to us.
Śyāmasundara,He embraces you when you meet.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He likes me. (laughter) Simply his only objection is that I am very conservative. He said, ""Swamiji, you are very conservative."" Because I forbid so many things. He cannot. Otherwise he would have joined me, but he cannot."
Śyāmasundara,No.,Prabhupāda," He knows that ""Unless I give up all these bad habits, Swami will not accept me."""
Devotee (1),He is a very enthusiastic chanter.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),"Oh, we were in this chapel chanting.",Prabhupāda, He was there?
Devotee (1),"Yes, he was there. He came down on stage, jumping up and down, ""Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" Then he cooked prasādam . He was very enthusiastic.",Prabhupāda," No, he has promised to me that ""Wherever I shall go, I shall chant."" That he has promised."
Śyāmasundara,"He's going to be... He gave me his address in California, so he'll be living there for some time.",Prabhupāda," I asked him that if he was there he can see me again. Our mission is very nice. We want to see everyone happy. We don't want anything from anyone. We don't say that ""You give me fee, then I give you some mantra ."" No, we don't say like that. Our instruction is free. I want to see that they are doing it and they are happy, that's all. Rādhā - kṛṣṇa bolo, saṅge calo, ei - mātra bhikhā cāi , this Bhaktivinoda's, ""You simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and come with me. This much I want. I don't want anything else."""
Śyāmasundara,"So one who is mad after something else material, mad after this or that...",Prabhupāda, It is perverted.
Śyāmasundara,"And he must transfer his love..., madness to Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda, That madness should be for Kṛṣṇa .
Śyāmasundara,So how is that madness transferred?,Prabhupāda," By this devotional service. You practice it to love Kṛṣṇa . And then when you come to the actual stage, you will be mad after Kṛṣṇa . This is the process to bring to you..., bring you to the platform."
Śyāmasundara,No other way can replace...,Prabhupāda," Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti : [Bg. 18.55 ] by devotional service. Neither by jñāna , yoga , karma , no, that will not touch. You cannot become mad after Kṛṣṇa by any means except by this devotional service. Therefore, we are so much conservative. Because if we are actually after Kṛṣṇa , then we must accept the real method."
Devotee (2),"Though we must be eager for devotional service, we still have to have this patience and determination, then create some...",Prabhupāda," Yes, because māyā is strong, sometimes you are deviated. Therefore we have to be determined."
Śyāmasundara,"It seems only natural, gradually if you are all the time serving, serving, serving Kṛṣṇa , eventually...",Prabhupāda," Yes, this is the only way. Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ [ Brs . 1.2.234] . By your service, Kṛṣṇa will automatically reveal Himself. He wants service; therefore He said, ""Surrender unto Me."" ""Surrender unto Me,"" not stop all activities. ""Surrender unto Me."" What He will say, you do. That is surrender. Just like Arjuna surrendered. So surrender means that he had to fight. That is surrender. Not that ""I surrender, I do nothing."" That is not surrender. That is only negation. Doing nothing of the material things, that is negation. Take the positive view. That is doing always for Kṛṣṇa ."
Śyāmasundara,"Eventually your mind will become so occupied, and every field of activity will become so occupied, that you will forget everything else, eventually.",Prabhupāda," Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyaṁ [ Brs. 1.1.11] . Zero, all everything zero, make it zero. Śūnyam. Jñāna -karmādy- anāvṛtam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] . Jñāna - karma means there is some aspiration of profit. Karmīs, they are trying to be elevated in the higher planetary system. And jñānīs, they are wanting to become one with the Supreme. So that is also demand. That means there is some desire. It is anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] . But one has to become anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam —a ny desire, make it zero. Then what to do, I shall become dull and dumb? No. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu- śīlanaṁ [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] , you have to work according..., favorably, as Kṛṣṇa desires. That's it. That is wanted, that is bhakti . Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu, that is wanted. You have to simply abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa or His representative, that's all. That is required."
Śyāmasundara,Then you become automatically mad after Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. The more you practice, the more you become mad ."
Devotee (2),"As in that verse, ""Thus by the higher self conquer the lower... Thus with the higher self conquer the lower self and curb the insatiable enemy known as lust.""",Prabhupāda, Higher self? I don't follow.
Devotee (2),That verse in the Gītā ?,Prabhupāda," No, this is Bhakti - rasāmṛta - sindhu . You will find in Nectar of Devotion. Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyaṁ jñāna -karmādy- anāvṛtam [ Brs. 1.1.11] . You have read this Nectar of Devotion?"
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, You will find there. Where is Nectar of Devotion? Bring it.
Śyāmasundara,"So our business, our main business really is engaging people in serving Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Somehow or other engage. If you cannot engage him, then let him simply eat. Engage him in eating, that's all. We are actually doing in the beginning: ""Please come here and take some prasadam and go home."" Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyaṁ jñāna -karmādy- anāvṛtam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] ."
Śyāmasundara,"Turn the light switch on. (break) Which, the first sentence?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara,"""The three categories of devotional service which Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī describes in Bhakti - rasamrta - sindhu are listed as devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service in pure love of Godhead. There are many subheadings in each of these categories. Generally it is understood that in the category of devotional service in practice there are two different qualities, devotional service in ecstasy has four qualities, and devotional service in pure love of Godhead has six qualities. These qualities will be explained by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī later on.",Prabhupāda," This is the point. Preaching means this. Even one has no previous record of service, still, if he meets a pure devotee, he becomes enthusiastic. Therefore preaching required. Otherwise, one can say that whatever he has done last life, he will begin from there. No. Then?"
Śyāmasundara,"""Anyway, for persons who have a natural taste for understanding books like the Bhagavad- gītā and Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , devotional service is easier than for those who are simply accustomed to mental speculation and argumentative processes.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,"It's so clear, this book.",Prabhupāda," You read regularly, Nectar of Devotion, regularly. All these books should be regularly read. That will give you guidance. You haven't got to ask repeatedly to me; everything is there. You are selling Nectar of Devotion ?"
Devotee (2),We're waiting for our next shipment from Japan . Then we'll begin.,Prabhupāda," These four books will give you all guidance- Kṛṣṇa , Nectar of Devotion, Bhagavad- gītā As It Is, and... What is that?"
Devotee (2),Teachings of Lord Caitanya .,Prabhupāda, All guidance. Rādhā - kṛṣṇa bolo bolo bolo re sobāi.
Devotee (1),What does that mean?,Prabhupāda," Lord Caitanya is preaching simply this, that you all chant Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa , or Hare Kṛṣṇa , that's all. Ei śikhā diyā , sab nadīyā phirche nece' gaura - nitāi . ""By teaching this philosophy, the two brothers, Gaura - Nitāi , are traveling all over Nadia."" Māyār bośe, jāccho bhese', Khāccho hābuḍubu bhāi . ""Why you are being carried away by the waves of māyā ? Why, unnecessarily? And you are being drowned and saved."" Jīv kṛṣṇa -dās, e biśwās, korle, ""Simply believe that you are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa , then all these troubles immediately gone."" Bolbe jabe, pulak ha'be, that ""If you chant this, then you will feel ecstasy."" Rādhā kṛṣṇa bolo, saṅge calo, ei - mātra bhikhā, ""So I don't ask you anything. Simply chant and come with me."" Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Have you got puffed rice? No."
Devotee (2),In the shop. You have to get it from the shop.,Prabhupāda, But I don't think you can get now.
Devotee (1); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (1); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (2); Devotee (1),"We could try.; Any stores open?; I'll go see.; That supermarket?; It's Easter Sunday.; There's a little shop, they always carry puffed rice.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Śyāmasundara,Puffed rice in the box.,Prabhupāda, You have got peanuts?
Devotee (2),"Yes. Peanuts, milk.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (2),Peanuts and milk?,Prabhupāda," No, puffed rice and peanuts, and milk separate. (laughter)"
Devotee (2),"These flowers here in the vase on your desk, they only..., the smell, the flavor, only comes out at night.",Prabhupāda, Rajiniganda. They are called Rajiniganda.
Devotee (2),Night Queen?,Prabhupāda, Very nice flower. (indistinct) In English is called (indistinct)? What do you call in English?
Devotee (2),Night Queen. In Fiji they call them Night Queen. I didn't know if this was the same thing.,Prabhupāda," Just see how Kṛṣṇa's creation, wonderful creation. And they defy, ""Oh, what nonsense they are."" There is no brain in creating such nice flower, flavor? ""It is automatic, nature, nature."" What is this nature? Rascal. Nature means rascaldom. Nature. What do you mean by nature? Just see how foolish they are. They cannot explain what is this nature. Simply say. I'm simply sorry that the so-called institution education simply making people all fools and rascals. That is my grief only. I am therefore trying to give them some intelligence. The whole program is to create some fools and rascals, that's all. Any philosopher, any scientist comes, I can say that ""You are simply creating fools and rascals because you are also fools and rascals."" I can say, challenge. Then let us come to argument. ""You are such a fool and rascal and you are creating fools and rascals, that's all. That is your business."" And that is going on as the advancement of education. You do not know. What do you... How do you explain? You say nature. That means you are fool. We have got our explanation. Kṛṣṇa , His energy is working. Svābhāvikī jñāna - bala - kriyā ca . His energy is so fine and nice that automatically it appears that the color has come, the painting has come, but there is working, very fine work, working. The modern science, you want to talk with a friend, immediately you pay something, telephone, ""Yes, I am speaking."" Actually the man is there, he is talking and I am hearing, but by scientific arrangement is so that he is thousand miles away, just like speaking with him. But he has come before me. Although he is away thousand miles, it appears that he has come before me and talking."
Śyāmasundara,Computer.,Prabhupāda," Computer. That is mechanical, the calculation. The calculating process is there; but by nice machine, it is shortened. That process is Kṛṣṇa's energy. He is so expert that it is just like computers—immediately comes. Not that the process is not there. Process is there."
Śyāmasundara,"It seems like the more and more scientists try to investigate and imitate this process, they become more and more entangled in the complications. They can't understand it.",Prabhupāda," That process is crude. They are thinking that it is very fine, but it is still crude. Just like here, the... What I was speaking?"
Śyāmasundara,"The more scientists investigate the workings of nature, the more complicated it becomes. They can never understand it.",Prabhupāda, No.
Śyāmasundara,"They think it's complicated, but still...",Prabhupāda," Not complicated, it is perfect."
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, But they have no brain to understand.
Śyāmasundara,It becomes more complex.,Prabhupāda," Just like any ordinary man, how this tape recorder is working? There is a process. But because we have no brain, we think ""How it has become? How it has become?"""
Śyāmasundara,It's so complex to us.,Prabhupāda," So one who does not know, it is complex. One who is in knowledge, for him it is not complex. Therefore, Bhāgavata says anvayād vitarekabhyam (?). Anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ . The Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely well versed. Kṛṣṇa just like says, ""Yes, I spoke this philosophy millions of years. I remember; you have forgot."" There we have to study, how Kṛṣṇa's brain is. Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad- gītā , ""Yes, I spoke."" When Arjuna defied, ""How can I believe that You spoke millions of years ago this philosophy to sun-god?"" ""Yes, that's a fact. You also were there. But I remember, you don't remember."" The child, just like father says, ""My dear child, when you were two years old you fell down and there was a fracture in your brain."" ""Yes?"" He cannot remember. The father can say, ""Yes, it happened. You have forgotten. I remember."" This is practical. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa can remember everything, vedāhaṁ samatītāni [ Bg . 7.26 ] . You may not remember. You have no such brain, you are teeny. But why should you defy Kṛṣṇa ? Why should you deny the facility for Kṛṣṇa ? That means you are thinking, ""Kṛṣṇa, He is like me."" Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā . Because you are rascal, you are thinking Kṛṣṇa is like another rascal like you. That is poor fund of knowledge. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto [Bg. 9.11 ] . ""Because they do not know, rascal, what I am, what I can do,"" avajānanti , ""they think, 'Kṛṣṇa is like me.' """
Śyāmasundara,"So actually most people are innocent, but if the...",Prabhupāda," Not innocent-rascal. Innocent, another thing. Innocent, if he is innocent, if I say, ""You do not know, this is..."" ""Oh,"" then he will accept. But he will protest, a rascal. Innocent will accept. Therefore, the more one is innocent, simple, it is easy for him, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The more one is rascal, it is very difficult."
Devotee (2),Is one called Māyāvāda philosophy?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (2),"Māyāvādīs, are they thinking like that, Kṛṣṇa is...",Prabhupāda," Yes, ""He is ordinary man. A little better than me, that's all."" That Dr. Frog's philosophy. Atlantic was ""That's all right, may be little one feet more than this well, that's all."" He cannot imagine that millions of wells will be not compared. That he cannot begin. He says, ""Yes, it may be bigger, say one foot bigger, two feet bigger. All right, ten feet bigger, make compromise."" That's all. He will never think that beyond his estimation. Never think. He'll simply calculate, ""All right, if not one, two feet, three feet. All right, ten feet."" And the friend will say, ""No, no, it is very, very great."""
Śyāmasundara,"Once you said..., you quoted one verse in Māyāpur and you said that everyone is dancing under Kṛṣṇa's direction. I forgot your explanation.",Prabhupāda, 
Śyāmasundara,"But He is always playing the tune, Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,Kṛṣṇa is always playing the tune by which everyone is dancing?,Prabhupāda," No. You wanted to dance like this, He is giving facility. He is not in agreement with you."
Śyāmasundara,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda," Otherwise, why does He say, ""You give up all this nonsense, you surrender""? He does not approve, but he wanted to dance, ""All right, you take the facility, dance."" He doesn't like that you should dance like that, but he wants. ""All right, you dance. You can take the facility, dance."" Just like my Guru Mahārāja , Tīrtha Mahārāja wanted his property. ""All right, take this property."" But what he is doing?"
Śyāmasundara,Sitting there in his wheelchair.,Prabhupāda," ""You want this property, take property. All right."" He's kind, ""All right, this man gave me some service, he wants this property. All right, take this property."" But what he has gained?"
Śyāmasundara,Nothing.,Prabhupāda," Yes. I never wanted his property. I simply desired that such a sublime message, like my poetry, that..."
Śyāmasundara,First poem upon arriving.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Miracle done. I wanted, ""Oh, there is a miracle. If I try to preach this miracle in the world."" So he has given me the facility. I never wanted the Gauḍīya Maṭha buildings."
Śyāmasundara,"So because you desired in a certain way, He provided that facility also.",Prabhupāda," Yes, I desired that such a wonderful message, why not preach?"
Devotee (3),And you got buildings also.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (3),You got buildings...,Prabhupāda," Building automatically comes. But rascal fools, they do not understand this. That is mentioned in the... In bhakti , other success follows. Just like when the queen goes, there are many maidservants catching the..., what is called?"
Śyāmasundara,Train.,Prabhupāda," Train, yes. They follow. So if bhakti follows, then all other things follows. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura also says that muktiḥ mukulitāṅjali sevate asmān , bhaktis tvayi sthiratarā yadi bhagavan syād. ""If there is pure devotion for You, then muktiḥ mukulitāṅjali, mukti is standing, 'My dear sir, what can I do for you?' Folded hands."" Dharmārtha- kāma - mokṣa samaya -pratīkṣāḥ [SB 4.8.41 ] . ""And the material happiness, they are simply waiting."" The servant waits, ""Yes, sir, what do you want?"" Simply one has to develop."
Śyāmasundara,The whole secret of life has been lost when this civilization was lost. Every knowledge.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So you try to give them, these foolish men. They are after dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41 , Cc. Ādi 1.90 ] . Therefore, Bhāgavata begins, dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo 'tra: [SB 1.1.2 ] all this cheating, rascaldom, is thrown away. Dharma artha kāma mokṣa . Dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo 'tra. Śrīdhara Swami explains, kaitavaḥ , these are all cheating. The so-called religion, so-called economic development, so-called sense gratification, so-called liberation, they're all cheating."
Śyāmasundara,Because they promise something they don't deliver?,Prabhupāda," No, no. Even if you get it, what do you get? You go to... Supposed you go to church: ""God, give us our daily bread."" God is giving, then what do you get? Bread is given to the animals also. Why you are going to the church? That is the Communist say, that ""We shall give you bread. Why you waste your time with so-called religions?"" The politician says that ""You want to be happy, there is technology. Why you are going to pray to God? This is all nonsense."" They are thinking that. But prayer is not meant for that purpose. Prayer... Just like we are praying, but our prayer is ""Kṛṣṇa, kindly engage me in Your service,"" Hare Kṛṣṇa . ""O the energy of Kṛṣṇa , O the Lord Kṛṣṇa , please engage me in Your service."" This is our prayer. We are not going to prayer, ""O God, give us our daily bread."" And if you get bread, then what do you gain?"
Śyāmasundara,We've all experienced that. We've had so much bread. What did we get?,Prabhupāda," That's it. Even you get bread, what do you get? Bread is already given even to the animals. That they do not know. Therefore, they take religion for material gain. Dharma artha . And Bhāgavata says, arthasya dharmaikāntasya kāmo lābhāya hi smṛtaḥ . When you get money, it is not for satisfaction of your senses. Kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10 ] . And when it is the question of kāma , desire, that does not mean sense gratification. Lābho jīveta yāvatā . Simply you have to accept thing for living. It is not that you shall not eat. You eat, live. Then what for living? Jīvasya tattva - jijñāsā nārtho yaś ceha karmabhiḥ . Your working so hard is not that to develop your material condition of life. You live peacefully without any disturbance of hunger, but your life should be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, asking about Kṛṣṇa . That is life. So we don't want to stop all the activities. But they are busy always, they have no time for... Ask all these men, they are obstructing: ""What these people are doing?"" There is no end of their sense gratification. First of all get one motorcar is required, ""All right."" As soon as he gets money, ""I'll purchase another one for my son, another for my daughter, another for my wife."" Going on, going on. And he has to maintain four motorcars, then work hard, hard, hard. So indriya - prītiḥ : ""Oh, I have got a car, why not my son?"""
Śyāmasundara,"Boy, it's vicious.",Prabhupāda," Vicious civilization. Simply increasing, increasing, increasing. And the government taking tax; therefore, he has to prepare roads. So in your country, the more the motorcar increasing, the more flying over, more bridges..."
Śyāmasundara,More problems.,Prabhupāda," More problems. Just like in Madras we saw, they are also imitating."
Śyāmasundara,Little tiny... (laughs),Prabhupāda, Little ti... (chuckles)
Devotee (1),A little tiny flyover.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they are advancing."
Śyāmasundara,Only two lanes.,Prabhupāda," And doing it for unlimited years. When they will be finished, there is no guarantee. Here in your country they do, they have contract, ""Yes, within six months."" But there is no guarantee. But that show is going on, that ""We are doing something."" Because it's imitation. There was no need, but they want to make advanced like the Americans."
Śyāmasundara,"Huge, open intersection, no traffic, they're building a flyover.",Prabhupāda," Similarly in Bombay also, they made one or two flyovers with great endeavor, and one flyover collapsed. That flyover between that Princesses Street and the Marine(?) Drive, yes, collapsed. Because all the contractors are thieves. Instead of giving cement, they are giving clay."
Śyāmasundara,"Now their plan is to tunnel through under Malabar Hill and make a freeway along the..., the West Shore Expressway along Warden Road and Nipensi(?) Road.",Prabhupāda, Freeway.
Śyāmasundara,"Yes, and they began the tunnel when we first came there a year-and-a-half ago, and now I don't think it's more than fifty yards into the mountain.",Prabhupāda, The tunnel is there?
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Where?
Śyāmasundara,"Just there between..., as you go up Nipensi(?) Road past the Russian Consulate, then there is an open space.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Śyāmasundara,In there.,Prabhupāda, Some work is going on there?
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (1),"Yes, under there is a tunnel being excavated, under the mountain, under the Hanging Garden Park to the other side. And it will go along Chowpatti Expressway and under the mountain and then along Nipensi(?) Road.; (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa , and don't be misled by these rascals. Andhā yathāndair upanīyamānāḥ . So you have to change this. This is scratching. It is very rough."
Śyāmasundara,Yes. We need some smooth sheeting here.,Prabhupāda, Or you can take one my cloth and change.
Devotee (1),There's a cotton piece. I have one cotton cloth.,Prabhupāda, That's all right. So you got puffed rice?
Devotee (1),"No, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I could not get.",Prabhupāda," Puffed rice is difficult to obtain. In India, puffed rice is very easily available."
Śyāmasundara,He says that here they close the stores and the shops. All the time the shops are closed around here.,Prabhupāda, All the time? Why?
Devotee (2),For holidays.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee (2); Śyāmasundara,"A holiday will come, everything closes down. Four days, five days at a time. Banks, post offices.; Not even a post office open.",Prabhupāda, Accha ?
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (2),Even tomorrow nothing's open.; It's really incredible. It's really a disturbance.,Prabhupāda, What kind of government it is?
Devotee (1); Śyāmasundara,"Loafers.; In India, the post office is always open. There's always some post office open. Even in small towns.",Prabhupāda," That was also British management. Here also British management, how is that?"
Devotee (2),In London it's always open.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (2),"In London it's always open, the central post office.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),This one shuts down. They are eager to stop work and enjoy their senses. (break),Prabhupāda," So that anyone questions, you can answer. That is required, preaching. Just like this girl, ""Why you are recommending your Bhagavad- gītā ?"" Answer must be there: ""Because this is. ""They are all rascals. They are not speaking Bhagavad- gītā as it is."
Śyāmasundara,She understood it also.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. You have no right. Suppose I have written one book. So I have got some intention. So why should you interpret my intention with your intention? What right you have got? You have no right. If you want to speak something of yours, then you write another book. Why you are taking advantage of my book and misleading others? I want to speak to the public something, I have expressed my opinion in that way. But because it is popular, you are taking advantage of my book and expressing your views. How much cheating, how much cheater you are! Therefore he is suffering, Dr. Radhakrishnan. He has lost his brain. We went to see him, Dr. Radhakrishnan, when I was in Madras. You went?"
Śyāmasundara,"Yes, like a vegetable, with no comprehension.",Prabhupāda, Lost.
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (1),At last he's become void.; Yes. He surrendered to the void.,Prabhupāda," Simply sitting down like this. He cannot ask whether he is hungry or not. His daughter is always attending, giving him some food, then he is eating. Otherwise, he does not say. Lost everything. He has mentioned Bhagavad- gītā as a mental speculation, in his Indian Religion . So he is such a great offender, he must suffer. But it is good for him. Because he is a gentleman, therefore his offenses are being compensated in this life."
Devotee (1),So he hasn't got to pay next time.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Next time he may be getting chance. Because he was at heart afraid of God. Because sometimes he was, ""Swamiji, you pray for me to God."" He told me that. At heart he was. But because he is impersonalist and mundane scholar, he was writing all nonsense."
Śyāmasundara,"There's a whole class of scholars now called literary critics who simply take one book, or not even a scripture but any mundane book, and they spend their whole lives making comments what this must mean, what that must mean, ""This is my opinion,"" ""this is my thesis.""",Prabhupāda," Punaḥ punaś carvita - carvaṇānām [SB 7.5.30 ] , chewing the chewed."
Śyāmasundara,That really is chewing the chewed.,Prabhupāda, That is chewing the chewed.
Śyāmasundara,One book called Moby Dick ...,Prabhupāda," That is called scholar. ""Oh, he is a big scholar."""
Devotee (2),Is that the māyayāpahṛta- jñānāḥ ?,Prabhupāda," Māyayāpahṛta- jñānāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] , yes. All nonsense. You take it granted that anyone who has no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is a nonsense, whatever he may be. That is I take it, and I challenged him like that. I criticized Dr. Radhakrishnan in my Back to Godhead, ""scholar deluded."" I was criticizing him like anything."
Devotee (2),That was the first Bhagavad- gītā I read was this one by Radhakrishnan.,Prabhupāda," I have criticized him like anything, yes."
Devotee (2),"Then Paramānanda and Satyabhāmā , they brought me this your Bhagavad- gītā .",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee (2),"When I first..., in New York.",Prabhupāda," Now this Macmillan's report is that ours selling more. Therefore, they have advanced to take up this enlarged edition. Otherwise, they are business. In the beginning they refused. They said, ""No, no, we cannot publish so big volume. We can... If you minimize..."" Therefore, we minimized it to four hundred pages."
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (3),"They made a study. They know what's going... They want all of your books. In the contract for Topmost Yoga and Easy Journey they have the option to take your next big book.; In Harvard Library, your Bhagavad- gītā — they have many, many Bhagavad-gītās, about four hundred, many, and Bhagavad- gītā As It Is was taken out of late, since it's been in there, more than any other ones. They all have dust, and yours has been taken out. And Kṛṣṇa book was never in, I could never see it in, because it was always out, from the very first day it was in. In fact, when it was going into the library, the head of the department, he took it right away.",Prabhupāda," Another thing happened in Los Angeles. I wanted some quotation from a place of this Teachings of Lord Caitanya . So the man came, he said, ""Swamiji, first of all I must buy this book. Either you accept or not accept our quotation, what price I shall pay?"" I said, ""Give me six dollars."" Immediately he took this book. ""Such a nice book I have never read. So either it is printed or not printed in our press, I must take this book."" Actually, these ideas what we have explained in our books, they're unknown to the modern world. Unknown."
Śyāmasundara,They're not described anywhere else. No other source.,Prabhupāda," Nobody knows that God can be person, there can be dealings like this, there are dealings actually, and they are described. That is wonderful."
Śyāmasundara,They don't know that life can be so joyful and endlessly...,Prabhupāda," That I wrote in my poetry. ""The Absolute is sentient thou hast proved."" That was striking to me. Not impersonal, ""sentient thou hast proved, impersonal calamity thou hast moved."" ""Absolute is sentient thou hast proved."" That was my acceptance. So even the many judges came in Allahabad, do you remember?"
Śyāmasundara,Yes. In Madras?,Prabhupāda," No, Allahabad during Kumbha - melā . They said, ""Swamiji, God is person, you are the first man speaking."" Why first man? It is already there. They cannot believe that God is person."
Śyāmasundara,"As long as there is imperson, there is doubt, there is unclear, unclear.",Prabhupāda, Unclear.
Śyāmasundara,"As soon as there is person, there is no doubt, clear.",Prabhupāda," But we have tried to explain how He is person. Just like we try to explain how God is working. So one should have brain to study things. One must have clear idea how God is person, how He is working, how this cosmic manifestation is manifested by God's energy. Kṛṣṇa says, mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta - mūrtinā [Bg. 9.4 ] . ""In My impersonal feature, everything is manifested there."" Tatam idaṁ sarvam . Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1] . So one has to apply his brain—that is intelligence—how it has become person. That is not false, that is fact. You cannot understand; your brain is teeny. That is different thing. Now you make your brain competent to understand this philosophy. (break) ... vijñātaṁ bhavanti . So take this philosophy nicely, understand this philosophy, and preach. You will be victorious everywhere, because we can challenge anyone. If you know the trick, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you can challenge. Nārāyaṇa - parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati [SB 6.17.28 ] . One who is nārāyaṇa - parāḥ , he is never afraid of anything."
Śyāmasundara,"Whenever someone challenges you, you always know the trick, what their weak point is, the weakness is in their challenge, and you go right there. Every time.",Prabhupāda, That is the trick of wrestling. (laughter)
Śyāmasundara,"Find where they are off balance, where their balance is off.",Prabhupāda," Anyway, there was a wrestler, he was not very strong, but he knew the trick how to defeat the strongest man."
Śyāmasundara,"There is a science of equilibrium where you can study another person, if he is off equilibrium, you can move his body in such a way to defeat him every time. Japanese art.",Prabhupāda," Train. That Los Angeles, there is one Japanese..."
Śyāmasundara,Behind the temple.,Prabhupāda, You know?
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, What he is teaching?
Several devotees,Karate.,Prabhupāda, Karate.
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (3); Devotee (1); Devotee (2),"That's it, same, that art of defeating someone if he is off balance a certain way.; Karate is the art of hitting your nerve points. You can paralyze people with it. Just with one finger hitting on a certain nerve junction, you can paralyze a person.; They do. They show movies of one man who has killed his nerves in the hand and a bull will be running like this, and he can put his hand through the bull and grab the heart. They're like that. They show movies like that. They develop like that.; So much wasted effort.",Prabhupāda, You have kept there some other razor?
Nanda-kumāra; Devotee (1):...,"Nanda - kumāra : I have put yours back. Yours was in a bag I could not find immediately, so I put another one there, and now I've changed it back again. (break); at least half of the energy that you have to preach.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (1),We may develop at least maybe half of your energy to continuously preach someday?,Prabhupāda, Continuously?
Śyāmasundara,"He says that someday he hopes that the devotees, your disciples, may acquire half of the energy that you have for preaching.",Prabhupāda, Why not full or double? You may have doubled.
Devotee (1),It's inconceivable.,Prabhupāda," Just like my Guru Mahārāja did not travel all over the world, so I have got double energy than him. So you must triple energy, four times energy than me. Then actually disciple. My Godbrothers are envious because they could not do. They could not do even half of Guru Mahārāja's work, and I am doing ten times. So therefore they are envious. So if an ordinary man like me can do ten times, you are Americans-twenty times, then you are successful."
Devotee (1),"If we can do twenty times, it's only because you gave us the energy.",Prabhupāda," Yes. My blessings are there, you do it, try. Just like Guru Mahārāja gave blessings to everyone, but if they do not try, if they remain Kuñja Babu , then they'll remain Kuñja Babu , what can be done? If he's satisfied only one building in Māyāpur and two buildings in Vṛndāvana , that is his only ambition. The ambition is poor."
Śyāmasundara,"Just like Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa and his wife, they hitchhiked all the way to Australia.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Śyāmasundara,"They landed by ship in northern Australia, Perth, where our plane first landed that night.",Prabhupāda, He is very energetic.
Śyāmasundara,"And they hitchhiked across Australia, one thousand five hundred miles through the desert.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Śyāmasundara,"He said sometimes a car would not come by for many hours, and they would be standing in the hot sun, no trees, anything.",Prabhupāda," Oh, desert, big desert."
Śyāmasundara,"A huge desert, they practically made their way across.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Devotee (1),He said aborigines live there.,Prabhupāda," Oh, they may attack."
Śyāmasundara,"Kangaroos, they saw some kangaroos. Those animals that jump.",Prabhupāda," They live in the desert, the kangaroos?"
Śyāmasundara; Devotee (4),"Yes, semi-desert.; There are many strange animals in Australia.",Prabhupāda, Predators?
Devotee (4); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (4),"Just strange. The marsupials.; Those animals that bear their young in a pouch.; The pouch here, kangaroo.",Prabhupāda, That is kangaroo.
Devotee (1); Devotee (4); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (4); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (4),"And platypuses.; And platypus, the platypus animal.; Half bird, half...; Half snake.; Under water.; Half beaver?",Prabhupāda," Hm, snake? Snake?"
Devotee (1); Devotee (4); Śyāmasundara; Devotee (1),"Yeah, it's part... It has some snake features, it has webbed feet, it has a duck like a beaver, a body like a...; A tail like a beaver.; A bill like a duck.; And a tail like a beaver, and a body like a wolverine or something.",Prabhupāda," So the Vedic literature says 8,400,000."
Devotee (1),This is all in one.,Prabhupāda," This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. If somebody is thinking, ""If I had like this, like that, like that, like that."" ""All right you will have all."" (laughter) Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu wanted to save himself in this way, that... ""Yes, all are granted,"" but still he had to die. All granted. So we are trying to take facilities from Kṛṣṇa beginning from ""O God, give us our daily bread, then give me motorcar, then give me airplane, then give me this, give me that."" ""Take all, but you will never be happy unless you surrender to Me. You take all."" This is going on. The modern civilization, they are wanting, ""We may have this, we may have that, we may have this, we may have that."" ""Yes, you take all. But don't talk of happiness, please."" That is the only problem. Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekam [Bg. 18.66 ] , if you want this. Otherwise, you take whatever you like."
Śyāmasundara,"The devotees, they don't care. They'll go across the desert hitchhiking, but Kṛṣṇa gives them happiness. They're happy.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is happiness. They are going for Kṛṣṇa , that is happiness. They forget the trouble."
Śyāmasundara,Yes. Today he's gone again. (break),Prabhupāda," Don't be doubtful about this at least. You may do or not do, but at least you be convinced that this is the nicest thing we have got. And there is no comparison."
Śyāmasundara,"And the more we experience it, the more we become convinced.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
