Jayatīrtha,We're bound up by so many conditions.,Prabhupāda," Ah, the conditions. So first of all you come out of the conditioned life. Just like we are trying to go to other planets with so many machines, so many mechanical arrangements. But if you have got spiritual body, you can go anywhere. Anywhere you can go. As Nārada Muni is going, traveling, any planet he likes he is going. That freedom is there, but that is in spiritual body. So you come to the spiritual body first, then you get all freedom. Whatever you like, you can do. Whatever you desire, you can get."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Just like Śrīla Prabhupāda gives the example like Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it might look like poison at the beginning, but at the end it will be nectar.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : And so they..., they're reversing that, these people who...",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . What is appearing as poison in the beginning, that will prove nectar at the end. [break] Even ordinary dealings. Just like I have given one watch to Śyāmasundara, that Omega. So I paid him... One hundred dollars has been spent to make it correct time, but it is not. Everyone, ""Yes, I will make it repaired."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Just repairing?,Prabhupāda," Repairing, four, five dollars, six dollars, and it is the same. And it is going on for the last one year."
Jayatīrtha,"Like automobiles, automobiles are built to break down in four or five years at the most so that you'll have to go and buy a new one. That's the way they build them. They could make them stronger, stronger parts, stronger engines, but they don't, so that in four or five years they'll break down and you'll have to come back and buy a new one.",Prabhupāda," (Sanskrit) Even in ordinary dealings, people will cheat you. That is stated in the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . (Sanskrit) Everyone is cheating. Even in ordinary talking, they will tell so many lies. [break] They live nicely in fresh air, in open air, trees, and talking about their business and they are happy. They have no problems for eating, sleeping, mating, nothing. Everything is there. And we are claiming civilized. We are dealing with science to improve conditions, the rascals they are becoming more and more degraded. They have no science, they have no laboratory, they have no university. How they are living peacefully? So it is... If this life is better or this life of cheating and imperfectness, full of anxieties, this life is better. Which life is better?"
Jayatīrtha,"The animals, they are living by the arrangement of nature, they live according to their nature. Whereas the human beings...",Prabhupāda, They have no anxiety.
Jayatīrtha,...perform prohibited activities and requirements and are living actually against their own nature. So the animal's life in that sense is better. At least they're not performing any sinful activities.,Prabhupāda," That I explained last time, that they are simply misusing their advancement, and they are satisfied when they have got a motorcar instead of bullock cart. That's all. They think, ""Now I am advanced. We had bullock cart, now we have got motorcar with three hundred thousand parts. And every part will give me trouble as soon as it is (indistinct),"" (chuckles) and that is advancement. As soon as one part is broken, the bullock cart is called for. They get a bullock cart to carry this motorcar. [break] Everyone is servant. Therefore, we teach our students to address ""prabhu."" ""I am your servant, you are my master, prabhu . "" That is the meaning of prabhu . Prabhu means master. And Prabhupāda means supreme master. That is the meaning."
Jayatīrtha,In this country there's a saying that everyone should be their own master. That's the philosophy. It's called individualism.,Prabhupāda," Own master... He does not know how to become own master. That he does not know. He speaks only. Now, what is their explanation to become own master? How they explain? Explain."
Jayatīrtha,The idea is that they want to be... to determine their own destiny.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Jayatīrtha,"They want to determine their own destiny. They think if they work very hard, they'll be able to build up their environment... (noise of plane taking off).",Prabhupāda, This is not explanation. Own master means master of the senses.
Jayatīrtha,That they don't know.,Prabhupāda," Actually, everyone is servant of the senses at the present moment. So one has to become the master of the senses. That is called svāmī . Svāmī means master. Gosvāmī means master of the senses, the same thing. So everyone is servant of the senses. Everyone is acting being dictated by the senses. ""Oh, it is very nice. Let me see."" The eyes dictate what we see. What is time now?"
Jayatīrtha,Five after seven.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayatīrtha; Devotee (1),"Five minutes after seven. [break]; We were given a ride by some young people, a couple, and they were..., this was in Bakersfield, California. They said that a mahārāja of Guru Maharaj-ji, a mahātmā , they called him a mahātmā , a disciple follower of this fourteen-year-old so-called avatāra , is in Bakersfield, and he's staying there.",Prabhupāda, Where he is now?
Devotee (1),"He's supposed to still be in Bakersfield after Guru Maharaj-ji, but this mahātmā is his follower. But they were very anxious to follow in his way because Guru Maharaj-ji is supposed to give direct perception of God. It's described that he will show you light.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1); Jayatīrtha,"Yes. They said when you meet him, he can show you light. He's giving direct understanding of God in this way, this light. When I tried to ask them to understand some Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they simply refused to listen. They had no desire to hear about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They said, ""What your spiritual master has to offer? What can you offer except just some scriptures?"" They had no respect for the śāstra . So many young people are following this.; Everyone wants instant realization.",Prabhupāda," Outlaws will say like that. ""What education you have got? You have simply studied some lawbook."" Outlaws will say like that. They will simply sell some book, ""Now we are better that you. Without studying we have written."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : That's why they are called demons.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : They are called demons because... [break],Prabhupāda, (indistinct) here?
Jayatīrtha,"Yes, they're in Hollywood. I've never seen it.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayatīrtha,"They have a place in Hollywood. I've never seen it, but I know people who have gone there. They become like a fad, like Maharishi. Two years ago he was very big, thousands of people were coming.",Prabhupāda, Who?
Jayatīrtha,"This Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . He was very big. He was in the newspapers and thousands of people came and paid thirty-five dollars, took initiation. But now you don't hear anything about him. So this man will come, make a big show, make some money, but in two years he'll just be a memory.",Prabhupāda, (indistinct) Why does he not come again? He has gone forever.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : You have said that whenever there is Kṛṣṇa there will be success everywhere, all the time.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : When there is Kṛṣṇa , there will be success everywhere.",Prabhupāda, That is the real success. (indistinct) There are so many places I see the sign for.
Jayatīrtha,"Yes, they are one of the biggest corporations in the United States.",Prabhupāda, Accha ?
Jayatīrtha; Devotee (1),"They're one of the biggest corporations in the United States. They have a..., at least one or two thousand of those, I think more than two thousand.; They're all across the country. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Colonel Sanders.",Prabhupāda, Many thousands of chickens are being killed.
Jayatīrtha; Devotee (1); Jayatīrtha,"Oh, millions of chickens.; Millions every day.; Just like this MacDonald's hamburger stands, they have a sign in front of their hamburger stands—they have also several thousand hamburger stands—the sign says, ""Over ten billion hamburgers served."" Their company has served ten billion hamburgers. [break] (Outside walking:)",Prabhupāda, America?
SvarūpaDāmodara; Jayatīrtha,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes. He told me he was very pleased to see Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he said he will start chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa . He said he will go to Laguna Beach temple and he said he will try out chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa .; He told me that he could see that this knowledge wasn't theoretical, that it was realized knowledge.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayatīrtha,He told me that.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Jayatīrtha; SvarūpaDāmodara; Devotee (2); SvarūpaDāmodara,"That the knowledge that you have isn't theoretical but it's realized. He was very much impressed by that.; Svarūpa Dāmodara : He liked the prasādam so much that I made another plate and he finished that. Then after that he took the..., he finished the... What is that preparation from eggplant?; The vegetable, he really liked that.; Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes, he finished all plate, he liked so much. He said, ""What is this?""",Prabhupāda, Gradually try to convince him and let him read our books.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : We are in the same floor. He works on the physics side, I am in chemistry side, but we are in the same floor, fourth floor of the building. No, he is on the third floor. So Śrīla Prabhupāda is saying that prove the existence of Kṛṣṇa by the science of physics, your knowledge. So he asked me, how am I going to prove the existence of Kṛṣṇa by chemistry?",Prabhupāda, That requires your knowledge.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : But he agreed the existence of supreme brain. We were talking about the talk between Einstein, Heisenberg, and some of the famous so-called physicists in nuclear field. So there was a conversation between Einstein and this Heisenberg, and Paul Durad(?), and (?), these are mostly (?) scientists, they are mostly Nobel Laureates. They were discussing, and without Einstein, these people they were talking, ""Why Einstein is all the time talking about God?"" Then this Heisenberg, he was not like Einstein. Einstein himself, he believed that there is a brain behind, supreme brain of God. And some of them, specifically this one, young Durad(?), he is also a scientist, he was very young, he was only twenty-five years old. So he said, ""Einstein is all the time talking about God."" This Durad(?) is completely opposite to this Einstein. So they were discussing about why Einstein is thinking about God all the time. And so... But ultimately they said, most of them agreed that there is a supreme being who is making all these physical laws, natural laws. It's already in the universe, but they are trying to discover it. So most of them agree except this Durad(?). So in the same line, (?) told me that yes, we agree that all the physical laws is already there. If somebody doesn't make it, then how can it exist? So he said he is thinking also in that line that there is someone, some brain, some supreme brain who is making all these physical laws. Otherwise there cannot be physical laws if there is not someone. He was saying that he started thinking in that line too.",Prabhupāda," (Sanskrit) He makes everything, but He is not attached. [break]"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : ...how do you know that guru is qualified, spiritual master is qualified? Then I said everything is written in the śāstras , so we have to follow according to the injunctions written in the śāstras . So all the qualifications of a pure devotee, of a bona fide guru , is written there. Just like you are a professor of physics in the university. Before you came, you had some qualification, degree of doctors. And then there is a committee to decide you whether you are qualified for the post. So it is selected by a committee of members and then they interview and then they find out your qualifications. If they find that you are qualified for the post, so you are selected as a professor. It's like that in the spiritual field also. There are revealed scriptures and there everything is written what will be the qualification of a guru and then how to choose a bona fide one. So everything is written, you should follow the injunctions of the revealed scriptures accordingly.",Prabhupāda," Committee is his spiritual master, he orders that you do this."
Jayatīrtha,The test is to see how much one is actually following the orders of his spiritual master.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Listening to another so-called guru , everywhere we go, especially in Los Angeles, they always talk of other gurus. They always talk of spiritual knowledge, but they don't find out what the real test is.",Prabhupāda, What is your answer?
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : So we show them our books and say that these are the real scriptures, real quality. The (indistinct) have to be the quality of the spiritual knowledge.",Prabhupāda, How do you explain? You are realized or not? (indistinct)
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : Prabhupāda, when you say that this is the knowledge that's been realized...",Prabhupāda, What is that? Why don't you explain? (indistinct) That means they do not know.
Devotee (2); Jayatīrtha,"One who is developing in spiritual life is becoming detached from material things. These persons who are following other gurus are attached to material things. They're still smoking, having sex life, drinking.; It's difficult to (indistinct) detached to material things. One should be attached to Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," That attachment will become. That is the special (indistinct). You cannot be completely detached. If you be detachment from something, you must be attached to something. Otherwise you have no perception(?). So you should be detached from matter and attached to Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotee (2),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, (indistinct)
Devotee (2),The devotee is always offering devotional service to the Supreme Personality.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is (inaudible). Simply by knowledge... Knowledge you must have, but simply theoretical knowledge... Practical manifestation that he's a great devotee. Whenever there is any doubt or question, he will prove by the evidences of śāstra ."
Jayatīrtha,"...was saying last night to our scientist friend, than Kṛṣṇa is the perfect teacher. The spiritual master is simply repeating perfectly what Kṛṣṇa is saying. So if Kṛṣṇa is saying, ""Surrender to Me,"" then the spiritual master is saying, ""Surrender to Kṛṣṇa .""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Jayatīrtha,"So in this way, the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa are in complete agreement.",Prabhupāda, Thus he becomes the (indistinct) of Kṛṣṇa .
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : The other teachers, they don't talk...",Prabhupāda, When is Ekādaśī ?
SvarūpaDāmodara; Rāmeśvara; SvarūpaDāmodara; Rāmeśvara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Ekādaśī ?; Rāmeśvara : Tuesday is Ekādaśī .; Svarūpa Dāmodara : Tuesday, tomorrow?; Rāmeśvara : Our calendar says Tuesday. It's obvious when they talk about their teachers that they never talk of service to Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Therefore, they have no realization. Our relationship is service. So one who is not engaged in the service of the Supreme, he has no realization. Whatever little realization he  has got, that is called śānta - rasa ."
Jayatīrtha,Dāsya realization is (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," Dāsya - rasa . (indistinct) [break] ...practical devotee, he cannot become (indistinct)."
Jayatīrtha,": (indistinct) what you were speaking about yesterday, that if someone claims to be a teacher but he doesn't actually have real knowledge, then he's simply cheating.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : There's nothing practical that they say.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Rāmeśvara,Rāmeśvara : They say nothing practical.,Prabhupāda," That means they do not follow any practical. That is their rascaldom. Nothing practical means they do not know what is the practical realization of God. That is their ignorance. And still they are claiming to be teachers. That is cheating. Just like these so-called scientists, they are theorizing, but they cannot practically prove. Therefore, their knowledge is imperfect. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. 7.19 ] . Jñānavān , the wise, after many, many births' cultivation of knowledge, when he surrenders, that is practical. Simply knowledge is useless, theoretical. When he practically surrenders, that is end of knowledge. That is perfection."
Jayatīrtha,: (indistinct),Prabhupāda, Yes. This is stated. You don't read Bhagavad- gītā ? You don't read?
Rāmeśvara,"Rāmeśvara : In class we have, every evening.",Prabhupāda," So in the Tenth Chapter it is said, teṣāṁ satata - yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti - pūrvakam [Bg. 10.10 ] . Do you know this verse? Bhajatāṁ prīti - pūrvakam . ""One who is engaged in devotional service with love and faith,"" buddhi - yogaṁ dadāmi , ""I give him intelligence."" That is stated. Satata - yuktānām , ""Twenty-four hours engaged with love and faith in My service, I give him intelligence, not to others."" That is the qualification. Buddhi - yogaṁ dadāmi te yena mām upayānti . What kind of intelligence? By which one can come back to home, back to Godhead. Not for material enjoyment, or bluffing or cheating. Not that intelligence. That intelligence also given by Him, indirectly. ""If you want to cheat, all right, I will give you how to cheat others."" That is material. In the material world, we can cheat. In the spiritual world, there is no question of cheating."
Jayatīrtha,The intelligence by which we can come to Kṛṣṇa is a special kind of intelligence.,Prabhupāda," That is perfect intelligence. Therefore we say Kṛṣṇa is the perfect teacher. In the Fifteenth Chapter, sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca : [Bg. 15.15 ] ""I am sitting in everyone's heart. All intelligence, memory, is coming from Me, and forgetfulness also is caused by Me."" So He is the supreme controller in every respect."
Jayatīrtha,Why are some people remembering and some people are forgetting Him?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Jayatīrtha,If Kṛṣṇa is the source of both remembrance and forgetfulness...,Prabhupāda," Yes. When Kṛṣṇa sees that ""Here is a rascal, so let him forget Me."" So He will give him intelligence so that he can forget Kṛṣṇa for good. Not for good—at least for some time."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : That is the desire of the individual soul.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. 4.11 ] . ""As one surrenders unto Me, according to that."" Real process is surrender. So if you surrender with some reservation, with some ulterior motive, then Kṛṣṇa will give you proportionately intelligence. When you are cent percent without any reservation surrender, then you get all facility, all help from Kṛṣṇa , without asking... Just like a small child, he is fully surrendered unto the parent. The parent looks after all the necessities. He doesn't ask anything. That is wanted."
Jayatīrtha,[break] ...the six principles of surrender in devotional service.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is very important. What is the time?
Jayatīrtha,(indistinct) minutes to seven. One of the six principles is that our interest must be the same in that we can't have any separate interest outside of the interest of the Lord. So that...,Prabhupāda, That is surrender. You have no personal interest.
Jayatīrtha,"That would be another test of the spiritual master, is that if he has some interest outside of Kṛṣṇa's interest, then we can understand that he isn't surrendered.",Prabhupāda," Anyone. All these rascals come as guru . They say, ""I am Kṛṣṇa ."" Therefore, he has got his own interest. That is immediately disqualification, that he is a rascal. Kick him in his face, as soon as he says."
Jayatīrtha,"If a person is surrendering to Kṛṣṇa , he won't take over Kṛṣṇa's post.",Prabhupāda, That's it.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : (indistinct) by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa one gets this bona fide spiritual master.,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa is always merciful. He comes Himself also and demands surrender, but we do not do that. That we cannot do."
Jayatīrtha,"As you were saying last night, if we had no independence, then there wouldn't be any question of... We'd be just like dull matter. There'd be no difference. So we have that independence.",Prabhupāda," By our misuse of independence, we do not surrender. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa says, ""You surrender!"""
Jayatīrtha,The spiritual master teaches how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Jayatīrtha,And it's done by surrendering to the teachings of the spiritual master.,Prabhupāda," Then whatever he teaches is perfect, because to the surrendered soul Kṛṣṇa gives the intelligence. So when he speaks, he speaks perfectly because Kṛṣṇa is dictating, ""You do this, you speak like this."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : In the Caitanya - caritāmṛta , Caitanya Mahāprabhu says to Sanātana Gosvāmī that spiritual life starts by accepting..., the moment the disciple accepts a spiritual master. And then he follows the instruction that...",Prabhupāda," Ādau gurvāśrayam , ādau first to accept a spiritual master. Sad - dharma pṛcchā . Then inquiries. Sādhu mārgānugamanam . These are stated in our Nectar of Devotion ."
Jayatīrtha,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Hm?
Jayatīrtha,"She is a 40-years-old lady, her name is Lucille. She is very much actually convinced of our philosophy and is devoted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but the only thing is, because she comes conditioned from a previous life, can't give up, has a very hard time giving up smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. She's been trying for about nine months to give up these things, (indistinct) but she can't do it. Still she is desirous of initiation. So I don't know what to (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," No. You must at least promise that he gives [break] And if we promise that (indistinct). But after initiation if she smokes, that's not good."
Jayatīrtha; SvarūpaDāmodara; Jayatīrtha,"Yes. (indistinct); Svarūpa Dāmodara : (indistinct); So if someone is sincere, we want them to follow devotional principles. (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," No. If you have the determination, Kṛṣṇa will help. If she is determined that ""Even if I die, I shall not smoke,"" then Kṛṣṇa will help her. And if she thinks, ""So I'll not do it. If Kṛṣṇa likes, He will help me."" (indistinct) Just like (indistinct). He has prepared some nice foodstuff. So he says, ""If Kṛṣṇa comes, I will give Him; otherwise I shall eat."" (laughter) ""And if Kṛṣṇa is very hungry, He will come."" So this alternative proposal is not accepted. ""If Kṛṣṇa comes, I will offer Him this. Otherwise I shall eat."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : That is personal motivation.,Prabhupāda, This is not surrender.
Jayatīrtha,Kṛṣṇa is not attracted by the foodstuff; He's attracted by the devotion.,Prabhupāda," Devotion, yes. For Kṛṣṇa we can offer (indistinct). [break]"
Jayatīrtha,You will go from London to Bombay?,Prabhupāda, If need be. (indistinct) [break]
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : It is dark.,Prabhupāda, It's getting darker and darker. (indistinct) So we will have to change our plan. [break] (indistinct) ...and they are also making dog show.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Devotee (2); SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : When I came here, I was walking and I saw big house and the restaurants. So I didn't know what... So I asked somebody, ""Oh, this is just (indistinct)."" And afterward I found out it was some food made out of...; : Meat.; Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes. But I thought in the other sense that it may be dog's meat(?) [break] neighbour(?) from Poona, he was also from Calcutta, (indistinct) to me, he came little later than I, he thought... One day he came to me and he said he took a hamburger in the restaurant. He said that hamburger is not made out of beef. He said it is made out of ham . So he said he had hamburger. He came to me and he said. I said, ""So you have taken beef?"" So he said ""No, it is not. It is ham .""",Prabhupāda," Now many Indians are taking beef. Most. In London, all Indians they take beef. The school children, they take beef."
Jayatīrtha; SvarūpaDāmodara; Devotee (2),"They don't remember their culture.; Svarūpa Dāmodara : When they come here, they change everything, most of them.; I run into many Indian people, many young boys going to school, on saṅkīrtana , on holidays. They don't want to try to understand Bhāgavata philosophy.",Prabhupāda, Indian student?
Devotee (2),"Some students, they are going colleges for higher learning.",Prabhupāda," He was inquiring that why we ask no meat-eating. They (indistinct) that why we ask no meat-eating. That Dr. Bernhard, he was asking."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Dr. Benford?.,Prabhupāda," Benford. [break] ...before me never dared to ask people to stop meat-eating. Rather, they learned how to eat meat. Vivekananda was eighty years ago, he came. He learned how to eat meat. Instead of teaching Vedānta , he learned how to eat meat."
Jayatīrtha,"In the Vedānta Society temple in Santa Barbara, they were offering chicken soup...",Prabhupāda, Prasādam .
Jayatīrtha,"...to the Goddess Kālī an offering, and then they were distributing it as prasādam .",Prabhupāda, In the name of Vedānta .
Jayatīrtha,"Vedānta means the goal of knowledge, but they are making an end of knowledge. Keśava went to Santa Barbara last night to finish up some last minute business he had there, but now he's back and he is resting.",Prabhupāda, So he is prepared to go to London?
Jayatīrtha,"He seems anxious to go, yes.",Prabhupāda, That's good. Why Śyāmasundara does not return?
Jayatīrtha,"He's here. He's also asleep. He came in the middle of the night, two or three o'clock in the morning.",Prabhupāda, (indistinct)
Jayatīrtha,"(indistinct) is in charge of our traveling saṅkīrtana party, so he's back here for a few days. They're going around to all the fairs, state fairs, county fairs, and distributing literature. He's had very great success",Prabhupāda," Indians are coming in Europe and America to learn technology, but next generation will come here to learn spiritual science, to seek brāhmaṇas. What do you think?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes, there's no doubt about it. They will learn technology the coming years, and when they become frustrated again, then they will again learn the spiritual science.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Jayatīrtha,"A lot of times when the Indian people come to our temple, they remark like that, that they've never seen such a temple and devotees.",Prabhupāda," There is no temple in India. As we are maintaining our temple, there is no such temple in India. There are temple, they are neglected. Just like here, the churches are neglected. [break] ...demons, and here we are manufacturing demigods."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : I read in the news that in the next five-year plan, they are planning to spend about thirty-two billion rupees for education, the greatest for ten years. They said that there were so many mistakes for the last ten years in introducing the basic education that everybody said there is no success. So they are planning another thirty-two billion rupees from 1974 onwards.",Prabhupāda, What education? To eat meat and beef.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes.,Prabhupāda, That education. And no restriction of sex even amongst the leaders.
Jayatīrtha,And all advanced contraceptive methods.,Prabhupāda," This Jawaharlal(?) was implicated with his sister, and some say with his daughter also, and he was the prime minister. This is their position. In our Indian system, education is mātṛvat para - dāreṣu : every woman except your own wife, all mothers. That is education. Mātrā svasrā duhitrā vā [SB 9.19.17 ] . Either your mother or sister or daughter, you don't live together alone. These are education. And they're freely advocating sex life. What is the (indistinct) difference? In India they're doing, so many leaders. (indistinct), it can be done. The leaders are speaking while doing that. No discrimination, just like hog. No discrimination. [break]"
Jayatīrtha,...in Īśopaniṣad that modern-day educational system means culturing avidyā .,Prabhupāda," Yes, avidyā ."
Jayatīrtha,"So they're spending so much, so many billions of rupees, simply to culture ignorance.",Prabhupāda," Making rogues and guṇḍās and hippies, that's all. The science is manufacturing atom bomb, and philanthropy is becoming hippies. This is the result of education. They are manufacturing compounds, strong contraceptive method, infallible contraceptive method. Suffering only. What is the time now?"

The State must be responsible. What the State reply?"
Jayatīrtha,"Well, they're having to litigate in court over it. The State doesn't want to do it. So this university there is one of the most famous universities in the whole country. They spend so many millions of dollars to maintain it nicely.

Ambassador Keating,Both the human and the animals?,Prabhupāda," Just so. Spirit soul individual. He is passing through the evolutionary process. Evolutionary process means as he is desiring, nature is supplying a particular type of body."
Mrs. Keating,That's very interesting. I believe in the transmigration of the soul.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is a fact.
Mrs. Keating,It's very interesting.,Prabhupāda," It is a fact. Just like this child is transmigrating from one body, one kind of body to another body. So in the same way, when I give up this body I transmigrate to another body. This is the science. Unfortunately, there is no university, no education, no culture of this great science. Therefore according to Bhāgavatam , the knowledge is imperfect. The knowledge which are imparting from universities, they are not perfect knowledge. And this human form of body is the opportunity to understand the position of the soul and how he is transmigrating from one body to another, what is happening next. In this way, in this human form of body, we can understand this science, science of soul. Unfortunately, no education is there to understand this science. So in other words, it may be taken that the modern civilization is killing the prerogative of the human being. He has got a chance to understand himself and to stop. He can stop this repetition of birth and death. He can remain in a spiritual form in the spiritual kingdom or with God, but these things are unknown to him, because there is no discussion in any university or any institution of knowledge. Although the Vedic literature gives us ample information of this—in the the Bhagavad- gītā , that is the preliminary study of all Vedic literature—but there is no chance for the people to understand. This is the defect of the modern civilization. Therefore it is necessary. And actually, because there is no sufficient knowledge of the position, I see the American boys and girls, although they are coming out very rich and respectable family, they are turning to hippies. In spite of your arrangement for very big, big university, they are becoming frustrated. They are no longer satisfied to live materially opulent like their fathers and grandfathers. In other countries also, the same symptoms are there. Just like in India, the Naxalites. So that is another form of confusion. In your country the confusion state is a different kind. Another type is another confusion. In China also there is another type of confusion. In Russia also there is another type of confusion. So the present position of the human society is very dangerous because everyone is feeling dissatisfaction for confusion."
Ambassador,"Any way how to make any progress, or have you any representation, for instance, in Russia?",Prabhupāda, Russia... Last time when I went to Europe I visited Russia. I was invited by one Professor Kotovsky. Perhaps you know him.
Ambassador,"No, I don't.",Prabhupāda, Ah. A very nice gentleman. Indology. He is charge of the Indological department. Russia has got very good respect for Indian culture.
Ambassador,Yes. That's right.,Prabhupāda, They have very good respect. So that.... [break]
Ambassador,"...have much, they don't believe in God.",Prabhupāda, They do not know the (indistinct).
Mrs. Keating,Do you have many Indian followers? Many Indian followers as well as foreign?,Prabhupāda," Yes. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so far Indians are concerned, everyone accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
Mrs. Keating,May I ask the significance of the markings?,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is a sign that we are Vaiṣṇava , devotee of Kṛṣṇa ."
Ambassador; Mrs. Keating,"You all have that.; And the bag, is that, is that...",Prabhupāda, That is our chanting.
Mrs. Keating,Oh.,Prabhupāda," We are chanting always the holy name of Kṛṣṇa . These have got special significance because Kṛṣṇa is absolute. There is no difference between Him and His name. Here, just like this milk substance and the milk name is different. If I want to take milk, simply if I go on chanting ""milk"" and ""milk,"" that will not satisfy. I must have the substance milk. But in the spiritual world the Absolute has no differentiation between His name, ...between His name, between His quality, form, entourage. They are the same. So this chanting of holy name means that directly associating with Kṛṣṇa . Directly associating with Kṛṣṇa ."
Ambassador,It's a constant reminder to yourselves of the...,Prabhupāda, ...of my relationship with Kṛṣṇa .
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is it.
Ambassador,"Oh, that's very... I'm very much impressed with the sincerity of these American...",Prabhupāda," As soon as one understands this science, he would accept immediately."
Śyāmasundara; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Devotee; Ambassador; Devotee; Ambassador; Devotee; Ambassador; Devotee,"The one thing that impresses us and causes us to be sincere is that we recognize Kṛṣṇa consciousness not on a sentimental level but philosophically, and because it's very practical. It's not only the philosophy is there but also the practice of the philosophy. So we realize the results of the philosophy, actually, in our lives. So this convinces us absolutely, because the philosophy works. There's no flaw.; Guru dāsa : Śyāmasundara was..., had a scholarship to big college for philosophy, and he was studying philosophical sciences, but he could not apply them. This was the reason for his frustration, searching. Now we found something we can apply in our practical everyday life. And not only ourselves, but people who, having families in the United States, etc., they wanted to apply philosophy. And that's the strength of this movement. We can apply it.; I sort of forgot..., I don't know what I asked you, where you joined the movement.; In California.; In California. In uh...?; Los Angeles, California.; Los Angeles.; I met the devotees there about three years ago.; Ahah .; ...and stayed in the...",Prabhupāda, He was in the Navy of your country.
Ambassador,"Oh, he was in the Navy.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Gurudāsa,"Isn't that interesting.; We've got a lot of Vietnam veterans too, join up.; Really.; One boy in London, he was on his way back from Vietnam, and he was completely shattered, and he found refuge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was a machine-gunner.; Where are you living?; Well, we've been living in London last two years.; But here you're all living in the Delhi area, but you're going down to... What's the name of that place south of here?; Guru dāsa : Vṛndāvana ?; Yeah.; Guru dāsa : We went.; Oh, you went?; Guru dāsa : Very nice.",Prabhupāda, Where?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : They inquired about our Vṛndāvana trip.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador,That's where Kṛṣṇa was born.; Oh.; Where is that?; Ninety miles south of here.,Prabhupāda," Yes, ninety miles."
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke to the Russians that the principle, our philosophy is the same, and that's service. You are serving Lenin and we are serving Kṛṣṇa . So by expounding upon the philosophy, then when you see that it's more intelligent to put his service toward God than one man. Like that.",Prabhupāda," Our, this is a fact, that everyone is serving somebody superior."
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Nobody can say that I am not serving anybody. Is it possible?
Ambassador,You're serving God.,Prabhupāda," I am serving, you are serving your state."
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So everyone is serving. Nobody can say that I am not serving anybody. It is not possible.
Mrs. Keating,But we serve God first.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Mrs. Keating,We serve God first.,Prabhupāda," God or anything, we have to serve."
Mrs. Keating,Yes.,Prabhupāda," That is our constitutional position. Just like eating and drinking. You may eat something, I may eat something, but eating is essential. You cannot say that I don't eat. That is not possible. Eating, sleeping, mating, defending—these are the bodily necessities. Similarly, the soul's necessity is to serve someone. Either you serve your country or your society or your family or your community, or at least if you nothing to serve, then you keep a dog and serve it. (laughter)"
Mrs. Keating; Śyāmasundara; Mrs. Keating,"Or what?; A dog.; Oh, a dog, yeah.",Prabhupāda," Therefore, the conclusion is that I have to serve. This is our position. Do you admit?"
Mrs. Keating,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Suppose I say that I don't serve. That is not possible. That being our constitutional position then, just like my finger, it is serving, always, sometimes doing like that, sometimes doing like that, sometimes doing like that. The finger's business is to serve. As part and parcel of my body, the finger's business is to serve the whole body. Similarly, we are part and parcel of God. Our essential business is to serve God. How do you find this argument? Do you refute this argument?"
Mrs. Keating,You serve and you share.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Mrs. Keating,You serve...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Mrs. Keating,...and you share.,Prabhupāda," Yes. By serving I share. Just like this milk. The hand helps me, brings it here. I drink, and as soon I drank, the benefit is shared by all the parts of body. Is it not?"
Ambassador,That's true.,Prabhupāda," You do not require to pass the milk through the finger, then with the toes. No. Simply put the tea, tea or milk, within, and every part of the body is satisfied. Just like you pour water in the root of the tree. The energy immediately, I mean to say, distributed to the leaves, to the tree, to the flowers, to the fruits, everything, immediately. Similarly, there must be something which is the root of everything. That is God. The Vedānta philosophy says God means the origin, the source of everything. That is God. Now you can imagine how that source should be. That is also explained. But God, or the Absolute Truth, is that, is the original source of everything."
Ambassador,Are you acquainted with Swami Ranganathanandaji? You have met him?,Prabhupāda," I am not very much well known to him, but sometimes I met him."
Ambassador,"He was in here, and I asked him the definition, his definition of God, and he described, he thought a minute and said, ""Well, I would say God in the thread which links one good person to another.'' I thought that was an interesting definition.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Ambassador,I thought that was a very interesting definition.,Prabhupāda, No. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā .
Ambassador,Hm.,Prabhupāda," Sūtre maṇi - gaṇā iva . Just like you have got pearl necklace, and if it is woven in a thread. So all the pearls, they are resting on that thread. There is no question of good or bad. Everything is resting in God. There is no question of good or bad. Not that all good men simply rest on that thread. Whatever we see within our experience, everything is resting on God. There is another verse in the Bhagavad- gītā , māyā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta - mūrtinā : [Bg. 9.4 ] ""In the impersonal form, I am spread all over the manifestation, cosmic manifestation, and everything is resting on Me, but it is not necessarily I am in everything.'' That is the statement there. The definition of God, first of all, if you take this definition, as the root of everything, as the source of everything, however you like. It is the definition given by the Vedānta - sūtra , janmādy asya yataḥ : [SB 1.1.1 ] the origin or birth or emanation of everything. Now you take anything and find out where is the original cause, then you come to God. Take anything on this table. Your self, your body. Everything you take, if you go on searching, searching, searching, what is, where is the origin, then you come to God. That is the perfect definition of God, janmādy asya yataḥ : [SB 1.1.1 ] the origin or source of everything. What do you think?"
Ambassador,"Oh, I'm very impressed.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambassador,The last...,Prabhupāda," This is the right... Another definition is God, God is all-attractive. Now, if you try to understand what is this attractiveness, just like your American country is very opulent, very attractive. If a man is very rich in the society, he is attractive. Then if a man is very strong, then he is attractive. If a man is very famous, he is attractive. If a man-man or woman—if a man is very beautiful, he is attractive. If a man is in the renounced order, he is attractive. If a man is very wise, he is attractive. These six features are attractive features. Now, these attractive features, every one of us have to some extent. Just like you are ambassador, representative of USA , so you are attractive. So this attractiveness you have got. Sometimes I have also got. Somebody comes to me, ""Let me see this Swami speak,"" you see. So this attractiveness everyone possesses. But God means who has got all the attractiveness in full. That is God. You may be very rich, but you cannot say that ""I am the richest person in the world."" That is not possible. But God can say ""I am the richest person in the whole creation."" Bhoktāraṁ yajña - tapasāṁ sarva - loka - maheśvaram [Bg. 5.29 ] . He says, ""I am the proprietor of everything.'' Just like in America, before the Europeans migrated to America, the land was there. It belonged to somebody. Now you are claiming you are proprietor. Say after five hundred years or something somebody may come. The land is there, we come here for the time being and claim ""It is my property.'' But actually who is the proprietor? Actually God is the proprietor. Therefore anything produced out of the land, that is also property of God. Just like if you have got a gold mine in your country. So I am not.... India will not go to claim that ""It is my property."" It is your property, because it is produced with your land. So if the whole land, whole sky, whole air, whole light, everything belongs to God, then where is your proprietorship? It is stated, bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ buddhiḥ mano eva [Bg. 7.4 ] . Now, nobody can say ""The sky is my property,"" but there must be some proprietor of the sky. What do you think? If everything has got a proprietor, everything is made of these five elements—sky, water, air, earth...."
Śyāmasundara,Fire.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Śyāmasundara,Fire.,Prabhupāda," Fire, mind, intelligence, ego. These eight elements. Kṛṣṇa says that ""They are my energies."" The things which are made by Kṛṣṇa's energy, how you can claim your property? Suppose a carpenter comes, you give him money to prepare some chair. The money is your energy. Now when the chair is prepared, he cannot claim that ""I have prepared this chair. It is my property."" No. It has been made with my energy; therefore it is my property. So if you make analysis of this whole cosmic situation you will find that everything is made out of the energy of God. Then how you can claim that ""I am proprietor""? This is false. This is called māyā . Just like we have seen in Calcutta when there was a (indistinct) during the transition state. Britishers are going on. There was a great Hindu -Muslim riot. Now they fought, Hindus and Muslims, and they died. After death, they're lying piles of dead body. No more Hindu and Muslim. It is simply lump of matter. But because they got a type of body, a type of mental situation, consciousness, they fought with one another, and then after death, no more claiming ""Hindu"" and ""Muslim."" This is called illusion. ""I am American,'' ""I am Indian,'' ""I am Hindu ,'' ""I am Muslim,'' ""I am this,'' ""I am that''—these are all designation. Really what I am? I am pure soul, part and parcel of God. That is my identity. So people should be taught this science. As soon as one understands his constitutional position, his actual situation, then he says, ""Oh, I am not this. I was struggling so hard under some misidentification."""
Ambassador,Is there a movement to get this philosophy or science propagated in the colleges?,Prabhupāda," Yes. We are trying, but we..."
Ambassador,That's your program.,Prabhupāda," ...we have no patronization, so whatever I have done, single-handed, and these boys help me a little. I did not get any help, either from my government or your government. But it is such a great science, such a great philosophy."
Śyāmasundara,"They're starting to appreciate it. Many of the universities we have a course, in America.",Prabhupāda, That is (indistinct).
Ambassador; Śyāmasundara,"You do have a course.; Yes, Berkeley, Southern California.",Prabhupāda, We have got books. I have brought along books for you.
Ambassador,Oh! Oh!,Prabhupāda," Big, big books. Dozens of books like that. Here is another book."
Mrs. Keating,"Now I know why I feel at one with nature, because I love the land very much too, and the land belongs to God. Now I feel at one with the land.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Mrs. Keating,That's why I feel at one with the land. Because the land belongs to God.,Prabhupāda, No. All lands belong to God.
Mrs. Keating,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Why do you think particular land?
Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador,"She worships the land.; I feel at one with... I feel, I felt an affinity to the land, to nature. I feel a close affinity to the land.; Isn't that a lovely book His Divine Grace brought me?; Oh my!; Guru dāsa : There's sixty-four paintings in...; Yeah, I sought to achieve those paintings. Lovely.; Oh, that's wonderful.; Now, Your Divine Grace, when did you... Did you from boyhood enter this movement, or...",Prabhupāda, Yes. My father was a great devotee.
Ambassador,I see.,Prabhupāda, So from the very childhood I was trained up.
Ambassador,I see.,Prabhupāda, Then it was very much adjusted after meeting my spiritual master. But the ideas were impregnated and I was trained up from my childhood. That was a great opportunity that I got a very good.... I have dedicated this book to my father.
Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador,"Oh! Oh, yes.; Guru dāsa : ""To my father, Gour Mohan De .""; Yeah, it's nice.; We met Prabhupāda's sister in Calcutta. She is also a great devotee.; Oh, really!; And she was lamenting that she has eight sons, eight sons, but none of them are devotees, and her brother has so many hundreds of sons, real sons.; Oh.; Who is this?; His sister.; Oh.; The sister of who, of uh, His Divine Grace?",Prabhupāda," My sister, my sister."
Mrs. Keating,"Oh, your sister.",Prabhupāda, Material sister.
Ambassador,"Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda, She is my Godsister also.
Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador,"She uh, she's uh...; She's also a devotee.; Devotee, but none of her children?",Prabhupāda, Why? She has got eight children.
Ambassador,"No, but I mean they are not devotees.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Not so much.
Śyāmasundara; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Ambassador,"And the father of one of our Godbrothers from America, Mr. Teton, he's from Chicago, he was there with Girirāja, and she was saying to him, his sister was saying to him, ""You're so fortunate that your son is a devotee.'' He's a very wealthy attorney in Chicago, and his only son is a devotee, but he is somewhat, from material point of view, he was somewhat confused. So she said, ""You should be very happy that your son is a devotee. I have eight sons, and they are not like your son.""; Guru dāsa : You met Girirāja. He came last time to the city.; Oh, yes. I remember. Yes, yes.; Guru dāsa : He's from Chicago.; That's right. Now he, uh, he has a wife here? No? He's not married?",Prabhupāda," No, he's not."
Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador and Guest; Śyāmasundara; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating,"But your wife is here?; Yes, she's here in India.; It's a lovely little girl, and so well behaved. She must have already had a part of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Our little girls at that age don't behave so well, usually. But she is so quiet and sweet.; Her only education has been from Prabhupāda.; Really!; Completely. She doesn't know anything but Kṛṣṇa and...; Really.; How old is she?; Three.; Three.; But she doesn't tell me her name. (child giggles)",Prabhupāda, This is bad reputation.
Śyāmasundara; Ambassador,Why don't you chant for her?; Could you chant?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. She can chant. Sarasvatī prabhu , chant little."
Śyāmasundara,Swamiji wants you to chant.,Prabhupāda," Come on, come here. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Come on."
Mrs. Keating,"She's shy, like all children.",Prabhupāda," She dances very nice, chants very nice. And very rhythmically."
Mrs. Keating,Really?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Śyāmasundara,"One thing that has so much gone to, into our hearts is the fact that this philosophy and this way of life is eternal and nonsectarian. It applies to all people of all different races, different ages.",Prabhupāda," That is my experience, you see. I have preached this cult everywhere, and everywhere it has been received well."
Ambassador,"Well that's a philosophy that mother Anne here believes in. All, all, all religions are...",Prabhupāda," First of all, we have to understand what do you mean by religion?"
Mrs. Keating,What?,Prabhupāda, What do you mean by religion?
Mrs. Keating,"Oh, religion. Well, I'm more of an eclectic. I believe in, in the best of all religions.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Mrs. Keating,I believe in the best of all religions.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Mrs. Keating; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Śyāmasundara,"The highest.; He asked what you mean by religion. You mean an organized...?; Oh, no. I don't mean anything organized.; No. What...",Prabhupāda," No, no, first of all, principle of religion. What is the principle of religion?"
Mrs. Keating,"Well I think it comes from within, inside. I think we are at one with God and I am a reflection of God. I am an idea of God. That's what I believe.",Prabhupāda," That is very nice. Idea of God means whatever you have got, God has got the same idea. Is it not?"
Mrs. Keating,Huh ?,Prabhupāda, You mean to say like that?
Mrs. Keating,Ah huh .,Prabhupāda, Or you are a sample of God.
Mrs. Keating,Yes.,Prabhupāda," A small sample of God. Just like you take a drop of ocean water and you taste it, then you can understand immediately the whole ocean is salty. Similarly, if you analyze your characteristic, then the same characteristic is there in God. Just like you want to love someone. Everyone wants to love someone. Therefore it can be concluded that God has got the propensity to love."
Mrs. Keating,Yes. God is love.,Prabhupāda, Yes. But if God is love...
Mrs. Keating,Spirit?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Kṛṣṇa means love, so when you want to love somebody and somebody wants to love you, the both of us must be a person."
Mrs. Keating,Both must be...?,Prabhupāda," Person. You don't love the air. You love your husband. He is a person. And he loves you, you are a person. Therefore God must be person. This conclusion. Because I am person, I am a sample of God, so God must be person. What do you think? Without God being person, how we can reciprocate love?"
Ambassador,"Uh, Your Divine Grace, I'm sorry, but I have an Ambassador waiting, and I have to move from the sublime to the mundane. I'd like to continue this, but he has this appointment and I have to... But I appreciate very much your coming in and...",Prabhupāda," Now, I am also coming to the mundane point of view. The next time I want, when I go and come back to USA , I wish to see the President, if you can help me?"
Ambassador,"Well I, I can write a letter, but uh, I've had, let me, don't let me discourage you, but let me tell you that I've had at least a dozen religious leaders from India request the same thing, and none of them have gotten to see the President.",Prabhupāda, But one thing is...
Ambassador,But I'll be glad to try to help.,Prabhupāda," So, the things are, such an important philosophy, important movement is going unnoticed. You are busy to help the whole world so that peace will come, people may be happy, but instead of being happy, your country are becoming hippie."
Mrs. Keating; Ambassador,(laughing) Happy to hippie.; That's right.,Prabhupāda," So there is some defect, and here is a chance to rectify that defect. Here is a chance. I can argue with any scientist, any philosopher, that this is the only remedy to save people from frustration. This is the only remedy. Why it should go unnoticed by your country, such a great, who are willing to help others, willing to help. You started the United Nations in your country for that. Let us do something tangible, scientific, that people will be happy."
Ambassador,"Oh, I think the, what this young man says is very encouraging, that some of this is now being slowly inculcated in our colleges and universities.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Ambassador; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador; Gurudāsa; Mrs. Keating; Ambassador,"Of all the movements, religious movements from India that have gone there, this one has shown the most potency of all, by far...; Yes.; There's been nothing like this movement ever before in the United States or in the world. And its potency proves the philosophy. If something is potent it automatically grows.; Yes, that's true.; Guru dāsa : We want also to be encouraged by our brothers and friends.; Yes, well that's right, and I'm so grateful to you for that lovely book. That's a beautiful book. I'll keep it out here on my table. Maybe I will send... You know, I had a young man here that was having trouble to extend his visa , and the government said to him, ""What are you here for?'' He said, ""I am here to find myself.'' They said I should have sent... He's a hippie...; This would be perfect.; So I said, they said when they were in last time, you should have sent him to us, which I would do again, because it's...; Guru dāsa : Then that hippie will become happy.; Will become happy, yes.; Well, Your Divine Grace, thank you very much for stopping to see us.",Prabhupāda, Thank you.
Ambassador; Śyāmasundara; Ambassador; Devotee; Śyāmasundara; Mrs. Keating,"Very nice of you. And nice to see you.; Hare Kṛṣṇa .; Give my regards to your wife. Bye.; Hare Kṛṣṇa .; Say good-bye, Sarasvatī .; Where can you be reached? Anyplace?",Prabhupāda, My American headquarters.
Mrs. Keating,The American...,Prabhupāda," Yes, American headquarters."
Ambassador,Is it in there?,Prabhupāda, Yes.

Macmillan Company has just agreed to print Prabhupāda's Bhagavad- gītā .; Oh, really!; Thirty-five thousand copies.; Oh!; Oh, that's marvellous.

That's wonderful.; That's great.; Really, and it's a fine company.",Prabhupāda," Yes, fine."
Mrs. Keating; Śyāmasundara,It's very good.; Ambassador Keating was the attorney for Macmillan.,Prabhupāda, Oh!

Here is Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī entombed, and here is Rūpa Gosvāmī entombed. Later on, several other devotees, they are not entombed like them. Flowers from their body, they were placed. It is called Puṣpa Samādhi . But here, the original bodies."
