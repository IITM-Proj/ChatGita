Devotee,Henry.,Prabhupāda," Henry, Henry, yes. So he revolted, not being controlled, revolted against being controlled by the priestly order. Here also we see,purohitaamātya-suhṛd-gaṇādayaḥ. When the king left, then the priestly order,purohita,purohitameans priestly order,amātya,amātyameans ministers, andsuhṛd-gaṇādayaḥ,suhṛtmeans those who are willing welfare of the state, they became very much aggrieved that the king has left."
Śyāmasundara,Formerly there was.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Śyāmasundara,Formerly there was. A town crier.,Prabhupāda, Trumpeting.
Śyāmasundara,They call it town crier.,Prabhupāda," Town crier, yes, yes."
Śyāmasundara,He would go around and announce.,Prabhupāda," Yes, the town crier. So the town crier began to preach that ""No more any sacrifice oryajña. Stop all this nonsense. No moreHareKṛṣṇamantra."" (chuckles) Yes, they... Just like in Russia we are afraid or China, yes. They will immediately arrest. So this declaration was there, public.Nayaṣṭavyaṁna, no charity, no more charity. Just like government at the present moment, they are allowing charity still, but most of the portion of the income they take away by income tax so that one may not have any power to give in charity. So at the present moment, the government does not declare that charity is illegal, but that time is coming very soon, very soon. As soon as there will be Communist government... Our IndiraGandhiis cooperating with the Russians, and as soon as she is under the control of the Russians, gradually Communism will be introduced. People are afraid of this attempt by IndiraGandhi."
Devotee,Ahhhh!,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Devotee,A monkey. No one is guarding.,Prabhupāda," Somebody must be there. So monkeys, they are now taking advantage, that these people have got some eatables. Therefore, Darwin's theory is from monkey. That's a fact. From the monkey, cow, and lion, the next birth is human life. Sovimṛśyaloka-vyasanaṁkṛpayaucuḥsmasatriṇaḥ, they began to discuss how to mitigate the troubles of the people. They began to discuss thatahoubhayataḥprāptaṁlokasyavyasanaṁmahat. People, they are now disturbed both ways. One way, the king is a rascal. Another way is that taking advantage of the bad king, the thieves and rogues, they are also very powerful. So just see how the saintly persons became compassionate to the people that they are both ways. Actually at the present moment, people are disturbed by unnecessary taxes, at the same time bad elements. So without proper king, without nice state, everyone is unhappy. And that is going on nowadays. In theKali-yuga, it will go on continual, and more and more people will be unhappy."
Devotee (1); Devotee (2),Is anybody watching?; No.,Prabhupāda," SoKṛṣṇaconsciousness means swan-like, they should be like swans. Their behavior should be like swans. They should live in clean place, at refreshing place. So as soon as somebody will come to the temple, he will be... (aside) You have some papers I shall show?"
Śyāmasundara,I just wanted to check and see if there's somebody here. It'sNanda-kumāra.,Prabhupāda," So keep this principle in view, that you have to become swan, not crows. They say that everyone, every religion is all the same. This is all nonsense. (indistinct) InBhagavad-gītāthere are different types of religion, sattvic, rajarsic, tamasic. And our this... If you take it as religion, this is transcendental.Savaipuṁsāmparo dharmo[SB1.2.6].Paraḥmeans transcendental, it is not ordinary,aparaḥ. Inaparaḥdharma, the materialisticdharma, there are ritualistic ceremonies how to make one perfect for accepting transcendental religion. But thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness is directly putting oneself in the transcendental. That is the special (indistinct).CaitanyaMahāprabhu... (aside) Why don't you close it?Caitanya-caritāmṛtasays,kṛṣṇebhaktikailesarva-karmakṛtahaya. If you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, then it is to be supposed that you have finished all other types of religion. MyGuruMaharajaused tociteone example that one's friend was sitting on the high-court judge's bench. So he was speaking to another, ""Oh, that Panchu was playing with us naked. He is sitting on the high-court judge's bench. Oh, how he was playing with us naked, how he is seated in the high-court bench?"" ""Yes, I have seen, you have seen actually he is sitting."" ""Oh, then he must not be getting salary."" He must not be getting salary. So this is the argument. Familiarity breeds contempt. So he cannot believe that he has become a high-court judge. He thinks that ""I am a rascal fool and my friend, how he can become high-court judge? He must not be getting salary."" But is that very good argument that the high-court judge is seated there without any salary? This argument is false(?). That is enviousness.Nirmatsarata. That is the habit of the conditioned soul. So if... (end)"
