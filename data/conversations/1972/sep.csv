Devotee (1); Dhanañjaya,"Not bad. No, it's still downtown.; It's on the motorway. It's very near to the motorway, the motorway coming from the airport into central London.",Prabhupāda, So why not see earlier? Have you got any description?
Dhanañjaya; Devotee (1); Dhanañjaya,"Well, we can't see it earlier because it belongs to the Methodist Church, and their committee members are meeting in another city, in Manchester, for a week. They have their..., a big congress meeting there. So they don't come back until the end of this week.; So we can't see it while they're meeting?; Well we could see it from the outside. Actually we went there one day, Mr. Allen(?) and (indistinct) and myself.",Prabhupāda," Well, what is the description?"
Dhanañjaya; Devotee (2); Dhanañjaya,"It's very nice. It's something like, ah, something like the size of this temple but bigger.; Bigger than Los Angeles?; And also it has a steeple.",Prabhupāda," Bigger, bigger. What is the price?"

It's only 600,000.; Well they said between 250,000 and 350,000 pounds.; Oh, the money, the money won't be as important as the place.

Dhanañjaya; Devotee (Revatīnandana?); Devotee (2),"There's a congregation there still.; You have no idea when it would be available?; Tomorrow I will go out, some of the others will go out, we'll find some places to look at for you. I have some friends, we'll all go see them.",Prabhupāda," So what do you think of this Dr. Sar? As he speaks, it is all right, do you think? Does he speak more than what he is?"
Devotee; Dhanañjaya,"Is he trustworthy?; Yes, he speaks more than what he is.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee (Revatīnandana?); Dhanañjaya; Devotee (2),"Yes. I, I, I don't like him very much. I, I don't know what his motive is, you know. I don't think his motive is strictly very much..., you know?; He approached me and he said... I was talking about life members to him, saying, ""Why shouldn't it be one hundred pounds? This is a good price for life members.'' And he said, ""Well, fifty-one pounds, this is the value of one hundred(?) rupees.'' He said, ""I am prepared to give fifty-one pounds.'' Then he said, ""Actually, I have given already more than than fifty-one pounds. I have given Kṛṣṇa's jewelry, so why you don't make me life member?'' And I said, ""But you have not asked.'' And he said, ""But I have given at least...""; Make him life member. He's given all the jewelry.",Prabhupāda, Is he a very influential man?
Dhanañjaya,What's the definition of influential man?,Prabhupāda, Or he's not very... He talks?
Dhanañjaya; Devotee (1); Dhanañjaya,"He talks a bit about his community, but he's not produced anything for this community. He's produced some money for the jewelry. This is very nice.; Personal money. Personal money?; Not just personal money.",Prabhupāda, Do you think he can help us by raising funds?
Dhanañjaya,"He can help, but I don't think he can raise thousands and thousands and thousands. See, personally he has no money. He told me he has no money. He's simply at his job he gets so much money.",Prabhupāda, And he's working somewhere?
Dhanañjaya,"Yes, he's working. He's in Oxford Street, very near.",Prabhupāda," And he says that he's M.A., Ph.D.? You see? So? He says so."
Dhanañjaya; Devotee (1); Dhanañjaya,"Yes, he's a graduate.; He's a doctorate, Ph.D.?; But still not so influential.",Prabhupāda, Neither you are. Is he reliable?
Dhanañjaya,"Well, he's said so many times, ""I can help, I can help.'' But still he's not produced anything positive.",Prabhupāda, This carpet was donated by him?
Dhanañjaya; Devotee (2),"Yes, this rug.; This? This has been here for years. In the beginning he did, I guess.Mukundawould know.",Prabhupāda, So you can askNandaKumārato give me milk in that way.
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Or you can ask Himavatī. What is your formula?
Devotee (Revatīnandana),"Ginger powder and a little bit of saffron and sugar. Heat it up for a while, and then after a little while mix thoroughly and serve like that. It's good for digestion.",Prabhupāda," You give toNandaKumāra, because he will give."
Revatīnandana,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," (converses in Hindi with Indian about travelingsaṅkīrtanaparty in Birmingham, Cardiff)"
Devotee (1),"She was very happy, Sumati Morarji.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (1),She went away very happy.,Prabhupāda, Everyone will be happy when you are Kṛṣṇa's devotee. You see? She's seeing Kṛṣṇa's so many devotees. That isKṛṣṇabhakta.
Devotee (2),She said she wanted to see the Deities before leaving.,Prabhupāda, And she saw?
Revatīnandana,"Two months ago she came here for most of thearatikceremony. The devotees came out to say goodbye to her, and she said, ""Go back and doaratik.""",Prabhupāda," She can influence the whole Bombay, she's so..."
Devotee (2); Dhanañjaya; Devotee,"Oh, she knows everyone.; We need a president like her for the board of trustees for London also.; Has she had any assistance?(?)",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. She is doing her best. She is nice."
Devotee (1); Dhanañjaya; Devotee; Dhanañjaya; Devotee (2); Revatīnandana,When is Mr. (indistinct) going to come?; He's going to drive Prabhupāda to Kensington tomorrow.; Tomorrow?; Or Friday.; He can't come before? He should come...; He comes almost every night actually. (more conversation),Prabhupāda, And the Joshi is the manager here?
Devotee (1),That's her manager here.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),"Oh, then he's the one who should know everything. She said she would carry everything for us practically around the world...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),"...on her boats. We have manymṛdaṅgas, everything...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. In Calcutta. From Calcutta, there she starts for all over the world. So simply... But Calcutta manager is rascal. Calcutta manager, that is difficult."
Devotee,"Why don't we send... Why don't we send a hundred, two hundredmṛdaṅgasto America and Europe, big shipments sometime? We really use them down through the years.",Prabhupāda, But I know that Calcutta manager is a (Hindi). (laughs)
Revatīnandana,"Well, they won't become... They have many... All the big men in the Calcutta house, they won't become life members. None of them. I know, I approached them. No one will become life members.",Prabhupāda, Calcutta house?
Revatīnandana,That Calcutta Scindia office. There's several big men. The one I remember is Mr. Trivedi. I don't know if he's the head man.,Prabhupāda, Trivedi.
Revatīnandana,"Yeah. I talked to him, but he will not become a life member. He wouldn't even give that much rupees. (laughs)",Prabhupāda, They are not very highly paid. Within thousand. InJapanalso. The high salary is in your country.
Devotee,Hm.,Prabhupāda," Unexpected fabulous(?) Just like that boy who came to see me yesterday. He's in India, he's getting 900 dollars, that means our ten thousand rupees. Gopal is also not getting. I asked Gopal to continue his service and give 400 dollars per month."
Devotee (1),Hm. Each month. That's great. Very good.,Prabhupāda," So here we shall give you books, cost price only, and you sell books by profit only and spend for building."
Dhanañjaya; Revatīnandana,"TravelingSaṅkīrtanaParty is very strong here. There's some very nice boys now.; They go out and they simply distribute, and just like I think inSanFrancisco, Keśava's... He began it here. They just go out with literature and simply to distribute literature, you know, in that way.",Prabhupāda," So Keśava's feeling not well, then he can come here."
Devotee (2),He wanted to. He wanted to bring his party here.,Prabhupāda, He can do that. Let him do that. Write him.
Revatīnandana,But actually he may improve it even more. They are already a good group. They are doing all right.,Prabhupāda," Very expert. Not only good, very expert."
Dhanañjaya,They're averaging sixty-seventy pounds a day.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Dhanañjaya,Sixty-seventy pounds a day they're collecting.,Prabhupāda, You are not collecting so much?
Dhanañjaya,What's that?,Prabhupāda, You are not collecting so much?
Dhanañjaya,Here in the temple?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dhanañjaya,"We are collecting, on Oxford Street, we're collecting about forty, fifty pounds a day, and on travellingsaṅkīrtana, sixty, seventy pounds, because they're doing it for more hours. So altogether we're over a hundred pounds a day.",Prabhupāda," Now you are GBC here, you have come, now you make it hundred pounds daily. How to do it, he knows."
Dhanañjaya,"But, but there is already hundred pounds coming. Two hundred pounds, then.",Prabhupāda, And his best friend is George. (laughs)
Devotee; Devotee (1),I'm going to see him tomorrow.; Is he in town?,Prabhupāda, He can alone make purchase a good temple. George alone can purchase.
Devotee (2); Devotee; Dhanañjaya,"He says George is in New York.; (conversation in background); Oh, he may be with Mr.RaviPatel. I think we saw him at the airport.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Dhanañjaya,"He's a printer, and he came in thevanwith you from the airport. He's a very nice man. He's doing printing for us. He says he has so many thousands of rupees in Bombay and in Madras from his printing. And he also wants to offer his services. I think he will come tomorrow to see you.",Prabhupāda," They can print our books, in Bombay."
Dhanañjaya,"He said he wanted to offer his services here for this temple somehow or other by getting money from advertising purposes. He's the director of some company that's just been started. It's called Golden Products. They make all kinds of consumer goods like shampoos and soap powders, so many things like that, for household use. And he wanted to use his symbol, Golden Products, with this society. This is his idea.",Prabhupāda, Golden powder?
Dhanañjaya,Golden Products.,Prabhupāda, In our society? No.
Dhanañjaya,I told him...,Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
Devotee; Dhanañjaya,Who is he?; He went to the (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, Yes. There was a boy.
Dhanañjaya,"His other idea is, he said he was working for Sai Baba,SatyaSai Baba. He said that in India he had raised so many thousands oflakhsof rupees by making posters. They are impersonal posters, so much nonsense in them, but they sold like lottery tickets. In this way he printed them and made so much money.",Prabhupāda, I mean he cannot suggest. We cannot accept anyone's suggestion.
Dhanañjaya; Devotee; Devotee; Devotee (2),"Yeah.; That's proven to be too..., too horrible.; Yes, always.; I saw Mr.... Who was that? What's that man's name who made your first record in New York?",Prabhupāda, Collin.
Devotee (2),"Ah, I saw Mr. Collin at the airport when you arrived in New York at that meeting, press meeting.",Prabhupāda," Oh, he was there?"
Devotee (2),He was there.,Prabhupāda," Oh, why did he not see me?"
Devotee (2),"He didn't come. He was a little embarrassed, I think.",Prabhupāda, He must be embarrassed. He's a thief. (laughter) Desirous man never becomes happy. He did not pay me anything as royalty for the record.
Devotee; Devotee (2),"Hm.; He's still selling it, too.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (2),He's still selling that record.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Must be selling and taking advantage of thisHareKṛṣṇamovement.
Devotee (2); Devotee,That's a nice record.; Is thatGovinda?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (2),That's a very nice record. Everyone is appreciating.,Prabhupāda, But I heard that rascal always played my record and hearHareKṛṣṇa.
Devotee (1),"At least he's benefiting somehow. I saw him in Bombay also one day in the market of Madhubal, Madhubhag(?) temple? He was buying beads for his store in New York.",Prabhupāda," He's selling beads, records, on our account. (laughter)"
Devotee (1),"He was being cheated himself, in Bombay. He was being cheated like anything. He was paying one rupee for one strand of beads, those poor quality beads. (pause)",Prabhupāda, Now you can arrange for the car?
Devotee,"Yes. Ātreya Ṛṣi is going to be working on it, too, to raise funds.",Prabhupāda," So, at least two first-class car must go to India."
Devotee,Cadillac?,Prabhupāda," Any. They must recognize, ""Here the Americanguruis going."""
Devotee,Have to get Cadillac.,Prabhupāda," (laughter) If the Americanguruhas no car, he's walking on the street, that is disgrace for you. Is it not? (laughs) And they criticize, ""Oh, what kind ofguruyou are, you are walking on the street? You are Americanguru?"""
Devotee,I was thinking if each devotee in the United States went out...,Prabhupāda," You write on the car, ""The Spiritual Master ofUSA.'' (laughter) And people will see, ""Oh, here is the spiritual...'' (laughs)"
Devotee,"Should we do that? ""Spiritual Master of USA""?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not? (laughter)
Devotee,"If each of your devotees collected five dollars one day, that's $5,000, more, more than $5,000.",Prabhupāda," That you... And soon as you issue letter, that will come. It is not my (indistinct) And she will carry. Make arrangement with government so that next time when I go to India, I sit on the car. That's all."
Devotee,"And Gurudasa... Actually we better do it soon, because it takes two or three months.",Prabhupāda," Yes, so you can do."
Devotee,We can talk about the details later.,Prabhupāda," That I am immigrant here; I've stayed since 1965. The embassy, everyone, knows. So I can take my cars, that there is a law. So in this way take permission from the government and you get the car and I go and drive it. That's all."
Devotee,"You'll take this car with you, Prabhupāda, wherever you go?",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,You will take this car with you wherever you go?,Prabhupāda," As far as possible. People will see, ""The spiritual master ofUSAis going there."""
Devotee,"Supposing you want to go to Bombay. You can fly to Bombay and someone can drive the car there. And then when you're in Bombay, you can drive it in Bombay.",Prabhupāda," No, you can go from Calcutta toAgra, nice road. And fromAgrato Bombay."
Devotee,How many days? Two days?,Prabhupāda," No, no. One day, two days, yes. Even if it runs fiftymileper hour, so from morning, early morning to noon, say six hours if we run, it's three hundred miles in the morning and three hundred miles in the evening, and stay at night. And then the next day three hundred miles, three hundred..., six hundred miles. Twelve hundred miles anywhere you go from Calcutta to Bombay, Calcutta to Madras, Calcutta to Delhi, within twelve hundred miles. Within two days from anywhere to anywhere you can go. India's length and breadth is not so wide as in your country. You have got... That is also not good roads, in your... But in Calcutta, to Calcutta-Bombay, Madras, Delhi, there are good roads."
Devotee,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, Good roads. So we can go by road.
Devotee,"So we can begin campaigning right away, collecting funds for the vehicle.",Prabhupāda," And you are a good driver. (laughter) Eighty miles. You once at eighty miles, his father's car. His father gave a very nice car for my driving. His father, mother, sister met me in Portland. Very nice gentleman, mother nice, sister very beautiful."
Devotee,But silent.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,"I have written to her some letters, but silence.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes. They are not very happy that you are in this movement, not in the family, naturally. They think, ""Our lost child.'' (laughter) They cannot appreciate that ""My child is lost for better purposes.'' That is the case."
Revatīnandana,"Actually, I wanted to ask you about something like that. When I tooksannyāsain Calcutta, some time afterwards, I used to correspond with my parents. So I sent them a letter explaining what wassannyāsa, and that I had takensannyāsa, and that I didn't want to hear so much more about nieces, nephews, things like that that I have in that family. I said ""If you want to talk, now we have to talk aboutKṛṣṇaconsciousness.'' So I didn't hear anything from them for about six months. But just the other day I received a letter...",Prabhupāda," Then don't. Now you have takensannyāsa, you don't."
Revatīnandana,I shouldn't do it at all.,Prabhupāda, No.
Revatīnandana,But she's quite intelligent. She's asking...,Prabhupāda, Your mother?
Revatīnandana,Yeah. ...all aboutKṛṣṇaconsciousness. She has theGītā.,Prabhupāda," Your mother, your mother must be intelligent because you are intelligent. Your mother must be intelligent. Without mother being intelligent, no intelligent son comes out. A son inherits the quality of mother, and the daughter inherits the quality of father. This is natural."
Revatīnandana,"The letter is so... She's told me, she says, ""Two reasons I want to hear from you: one, I want to know how you are,'' that's the body. She says also, ""I'm interested in thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement,'' because she's noticed that the devotees...",Prabhupāda, That is mother's anxiety. You see all this?
Revatīnandana,So I should not respond?,Prabhupāda," Hm, you can send news: ""Mother, I'm all right.'' That's all."
Revatīnandana,That's all right?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Don't worry. No.CaitanyaMahāprabhualso was sending news to His mother.
Revatīnandana,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda, Although He never went to mother.
Revatīnandana,"It's hard for the family, because my mother's brother is Viṣṇujana Mahārāja's father, right? So they also figure they have lost one son. They don't hear from him at all, and now she doesn't hear from me at all. So the whole family is very miserable. (laughter)",Prabhupāda, Hm. But they have lost for the better.
Revatīnandana,"Yes, but they don't understand that. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," Lost not in vain. They will be benefited. They will be benefited. You are giving the best service to the family. What about your mother, Himavatī?"
Himavatī,I never hear from her anymore.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Himavatī,I never hear from her anymore.,Prabhupāda, She's also not very happy?
Himavatī,No. I don't think she's very happy with me.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes. Anyway, you serveKṛṣṇaand then your mother will be best served.Kṛṣṇawill favor all the family members of a devotee. You have seen fromPrahlādaMaharaja's statement.Kṛṣṇais so kind that anyone coming to become His devotee, He takes care of the family of the devotee-spiritually, for their emancipation. That is natural. Just like government. If somebody dies on the warfield, the government takes care of the whole family. Similarly, if the government has so much sense, do you mean to sayKṛṣṇais nonsense? He also takes care of the family of the devotee.Yoga-kṣemaṁvahāmyaham[Bg.9.22]. Where isNandaKumāra,Pradyumna?"
Devotee,"Pradyumna's been studying all day. Ah...NandaKumāramay be..., is he there in the room?",Prabhupāda," No, I don't want(?). Maybe sleeping?"
Devotee,He is tired.,Prabhupāda, Not very tired. What was it?
Devotee,"Pradyumnadidn't take rest last night, I don't think.",Prabhupāda, Pradyumna...NandaKumārawas sleeping.
Devotee (2),Charlie Chaplin kept us up all night.,Prabhupāda, Hm.
Devotee (2),Charlie Chaplin kept us up all night. (laughs) Charlie Chaplin show.,Prabhupāda," Hm. That was nice. (laughter) He is really funny man. (laughs) He has got originality. All his comic play has got some originality, that is the beauty. How he invented! (laughs) I think that character, when he was a drunkard, he was a great friend, (laughs) and when he's not drunkard, ""Who is this man?'' (laughs) He's grave(?) as rich man. And as drunkard, ""You pay. You are my friend, life-long friend. Whatever you want, you take.'' (laughs) So these characters he's painting, it's very good intelligence. And he made him friend when he was going to commit suicide."
Devotee (1),"Yeah, he stopped him.",Prabhupāda, He stopped him. Accidentally he stopped. (laughs) Not willingly.
Devotee (2),"Yes. He tried to pull him up from the water, he went in himself.",Prabhupāda," It is very nice, funny man with intelligence. And before him there was another, Mr. Max Linder."
Devotee,Max Linder.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He was also very funny Englishman. In our childhood we used to enjoy their play, Max Linder and Chaplin, or Charlie Chaplin."
Devotee,They were showing them in India?,Prabhupāda," Uh? Yes. Max Linder, I remember, he was sitting in a park. (laughter) You know that?"
Devotee,I don't know anything about it.,Prabhupāda," He was sitting in a park, so that English dress, that tail coat? What is called?"
Devotee,"Coattails, yeah.",Prabhupāda," So the tail was hanging, so some naughty boys, they fixed up nails, you see? So when he got up, the whole tail gone, you see? But he could not understand. He went to the ball dance. So he's dancing, so everyone's seeing his tail, in this way. So he thought, ""Oh, what is the matter?'' He went to the mirror and he saw, ""Oh, my tail is lost.'' (laughs) Then he came again in the ball dance and he was pushing everyone, just to show. And everyone was asking, ""What is this? What is this?'' ""Oh, you do not know? This is latest fashion. This is latest fashion.'' Then all of them cut the tails. I think he had taken the idea, (Sanskrit). This is Sanskrit story, that (Sanskrit), or monkey, he lost his tail, and he began to advertise, ""This is the latest fashion.'' So that ball-dancing without tail, that was, I remember, it is very enjoyable. They say that Charlie Chaplin is the student of Max Linder. He learned this funny play from Max Linder. So I knew Charlie Chaplin is an Englishman."
Devotee,"Yes, he is.",Prabhupāda, He is Englishman.
Devotee (2),He went to America and then he made all these films.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee; Indian,"He went to America and he made a lot of money there.; As far as I know, Prabhupāda, he was Jew, but he used to live in east of London, or south of London. There is an autobiography about it.",Prabhupāda," Max Linder, ah, Charlie Chaplin? Yes. He was a London man."
Devotee; Indian (Ksirodaksayi?),"But that movie was filmed in Los Angeles, the one we saw last night. In Hollywood. All the palm trees and the (indistinct) behind.; One of the elder sons, he's still living in Hampstead Heath.",Prabhupāda," Oh, his eldest son. And where he is, Charlie Chaplin?"
Devotee,In America.,Prabhupāda, In America?
Devotee; Indian,"He's in Switzerland.; No, no, he lives in Europe somewhere. Switzerland, most... Sometimes coming in Hampstead Heath.",Prabhupāda, He has got a big family?
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda, You said that he's producing a still child?
Devotee,"Yeah, he produced last year, or two years ago. It was inLifemagazine.",Prabhupāda, Hm. (pause)
Devotee,It's already about 10:30.,Prabhupāda, All right.
Devotees,All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (devotees leave),Prabhupāda, So askPradyumnaif he wants to give.
Devotee,Yeah. [break],Prabhupāda," ...viṣayachāḍiyā. Oh, yes, then it is (indistinct).Viṣayachāḍiyā,serasemajiyāmukheboloharihari,paramakaruṇa, pahūduijana. But even if we do speculation business and do it forKṛṣṇa, that is not good."
Devotee,Not so high a class.,Prabhupāda," They are doing little business becausegṛhasthas, they require money. All right, do some incense, this, that. Not very big business. If one is expert likeArjunaorAmbarīṣaMahārāja, that is different thing. Just like thisAdvaita, he was given in press. Now he sees that ""I can work anywhere I want, so I can get money. Why I should waste my time?'' He neglected. That meansviṣayaattracted him. He thought, ""I am qualified boy. Why I should waste my time with this press?'' Therefore he went away. He sacrificedKṛṣṇaconsciousness, and now he's getting some money he's satisfied. He's thinking that he has become a big man."
Devotee,"Ātreya Ṛṣi went to see them in New York the last day, but they wouldn't come.",Prabhupāda," Both, (indistinct)."
Devotee,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," They are getting money from otherkarmīs, so why they should come? They are thinking that ""As family man we must make money.''Atogṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair,huh? House, land, children, friends, money for increasing their illusion.Janasyamoho 'yamahaṁmameti[SB5.5.8]. (indistinct) He does not know that he is being finished, and he's thinking that ""I am making profit.''Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jāta. This rascal, he's being defeated. He does not know. He got the chance ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness; he sacrificedKṛṣṇaconsciousness. And he is attracted by little pounds, dollars. (pause) But his wife is good,Balaidāsī. She is coming."
Devotee,"Yes, she came tomaṅgala-ārati.",Prabhupāda," She comes, and she said, ""Then we live separately,Advaita.'' He doesn't like. He's such a rascal. Such a nice, good, beautiful wife, and he's neglecting. (sounds of Prabhupāda takingprasādam) Milk, here they take cold milk, and they (makes sounds ofglug-glug-glugdrinking). No. Milk should be hot, and it should be taken little."
Devotee,Hm.,Prabhupāda," That is the way of taking milk. And thismasala, it does not taste good. In India, especially in Northern India, Punjab, they will take at night, milk, (indistinct). No other things. They, all business men, the Marwari society, they'll take food before evening and then again they work. Then after ten they will come home and take little milk and go rest. (pause) So foundation committee is being established in Bombay making her the president of the trust. Then Giriraja will have no difficulty."
Devotee,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," They'll contribute. And if she canvasses, she can collectlakhs."
Devotee,"But one thing is, if Giriraja takes advantage and begins preaching in her school daily... She's invited him, open invitation.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Then it will be pleased.
Devotee,"Then when she'll see her students improve, then she'll give us all help.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Now we have got land, many people will contribute materials. Materials, we can get materials from many big, big merchants."
Devotee,"Yeah, like, ah, Tarachand.",Prabhupāda," Cement, iron, they will.. ""All right. Give it.'' Goods, anyone will give."
Devotee,"TarachandGupta, I think his name is.",Prabhupāda, He is also our life member. He is nice.
Devotee,Iron merchant.,Prabhupāda, He wanted to invite me one day. He met me on the park. Do you remember?
Devotee,"Yes, I remember.",Prabhupāda, He's one of the richest men.
Devotee,"Yes. I think when you go back there the next year, or next autumn...",Prabhupāda, Now we have created some impression that we are doing something nice. Even Keating is also impressed.
Devotee,Yeah. We're not wandering from village to village anymore. We're settled.,Prabhupāda," No. Even we wander from village to village, people are being impressed that we are doing something good. Actually it is so. I tell you it is so. One who cannot understand it, he is a fool. Actually we are doing the best work, God consciousness. And actually it is a fact: simply for want of God consciousness they are suffering, that's all. There is no other reason. The only reason is this. Just like this morning I said, ""God is the proprietor. Why you are claiming proprietor? You may be manager, not proprietor.'' Actually that is our position. Just like I am head of this institution, but I am not dealing as proprietor. I am dealing as manager, head. Is it not?"
Devotee,This is the only society whereKṛṣṇais the owner of everything.,Prabhupāda," And all my assistants, they are also working in that capacity. If I would have been proprietor, then they would not have been interested."
Devotee,Hm.,Prabhupāda, I would have collected the money and used for my sense gratification. Then nobody would help me.
Devotee,"I think the English milk is better than American milk, isn't it?",Prabhupāda, I think so. It is from Holland.
Devotee,Oh. There's some famous islands between England and Holland called the Jersey Islands. There's special milk that comes from Jersey. Jersey milk is best.,Prabhupāda," No. These Europeans, Americans, if they take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, they'll be more happy. That is assured. From all angles of vision-their family life, their political life, their social life, their cultural life, their religious life, their philosophical life, their scientific life—everything will be perfect. Now you have to teach them. I can give you the ideas how they'll be happy. The rascals, they do not know why, what is your specialness, and just to teach you this. My only ambition is that you are... (aside:) Oh, there is no water. You are supposed to be the most intelligent persons. (Prabhupāda drinks) So if you take, others will take. That is going on. So I have no distinction between East and West. They're thinking that East is conquering West by culture. That is their enviousness. (laughter) That is, they are afraid. Because the Britishers, they kept Indian culture suppressed so long because... [break] ...thekṣatriya, kings, in special cases. Not for public. Among thekṣatriyas. And among thevaiśyas, one day in a year, when they were allocated(?), to try one's luck. One day they'll bet. Not amongst thebrāhmaṇasor theśūdras.Śūdrashave no money to gamble, andbrāhmaṇasprohibited. Thekṣatriyas, they were also allowed in special cases, and thevaiśyaswere allowed to engage in gambling one day in a year. That means restricted."
Devotee,"Boy, that system ofdharma... We can start discussing it tomorrow in our philosophy class. It's just so perfect. Everything is...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Whole plan is perfect."
Devotee,But the British systematically broke it down.,Prabhupāda," Because Lord Macauley(?) gave them in this study, they said that if you keep the Indians in their original culture, then they cannot be broken.Gandhitook that state: noncooperation. Don't cooperate with them. And then kill them.Devotee:This man who wrote this book made an interesting comment. He said that after..., or before the First World War, when the British were entering the First World War, they made a promise to the Indians that ""If you help us fight this war, then we will give you freedom afterwards."""
Devotee,"They helped, but they didn't give them freedom. SoGandhior the others, they took thatasat. ""They have broken their promise, so now we can break ours, noncooperation.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. They actually expanded their empire all over the (indistinct) world by Indian cooperation. Therefore these big men like Attlee, when they thought that ""India is going out of our hands,'' so don't (indistinct) up our empire. Forget it. They voluntarily (indistinct)."
Devotee,The whole thing. (laughs),Prabhupāda," Now they are not, those Englishmen, as they were in Victorian day. Nobody cares for you."
Devotee,"You'll see the last remnants at that Commonwealth Club, I think, engagement. No more, no one cares.",Prabhupāda, Commonwealth is in name. (pause)
Devotee,"Still, there is something about London. Everyone likes to come here. There's so many... There's not enough hotel rooms even.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,There's not even enough hotel rooms to accommodate so many tourists who come here to London.,Prabhupāda," London is still famous. People outside, they have got very high idea about London."
Devotee,Civilized. Very civilized city.,Prabhupāda, Why civilized? Do you think it is especially civilized?
Devotee,"Well, a lot more than America anyway. By comparison it seems civilized, in the sense that there is not so much violence. There's not... People are honest, upright, moral, a little more.",Prabhupāda, In America general life is becoming wretched.
Devotee,Wretched. Police don't even carry guns here.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,"Policemen don't even carry guns in Britain, but in America every policeman's got at least one gun.",Prabhupāda, The Englishman... I've studied Englishman. They consider America is still uncivilized. They say like that. (indistinct)
Devotee,"Still uncivilized, yeah.",Prabhupāda, But here also hippy-ism growing.
Devotee,They've lost that old aristocracy civilization. Losing it fast.,Prabhupāda," So write Girirāja immediately a letter, that she agreed to be president of the trust. You make a trust body for fund-raising, and our best life members, like Sumati Morarji, and make her the president of the trust. You remain the secretary, and other also, as treasurer also. One or two of her own men."
Devotee,Just a small number. Not a big trust.,Prabhupāda, Hm. In this way you raise funds.
Devotee,"Meanwhile, he should start utilizing her invitation to teach in the schools sometimes.",Prabhupāda," Yes, and she'll cooperate. And write letter for permission for carrying our motorcar and incense."
Devotee,"Yes, and inform Gurudāsa...",Prabhupāda," She has already agreed, that, ah, what is called? Punks? The punks sent to Calcutta, and from there then send to Los Angeles."
Devotee,Yeah. I'm wondering why they can't take them directly.,Prabhupāda, Directly not very many ships come to Hong Kong.
Devotee,"Oh, from Hong Kong that way, that direction, they don't come. They come on their way back. I see. Yeah, they take Chinese goods from Hong Kong to India.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,They take Chinese goods from Hong Kong to India.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee,There's not many from Hong Kong to America.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Therefore she said send to India. Take information.
Devotee,Transfer to another boat. That will save them a thousand dollars a month.,Prabhupāda, That's nice. That's a thousand dollar contribution.
Devotee,"Yeah. And as it grows, it will increase.",Prabhupāda," And send them a Gujarati paper, our magazine, distribution amongst their workers. That will satisfy (indistinct) sense."
Devotee,Hm. Tell that to Girirāja?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,"Hundred, two hundred magazines.",Prabhupāda," Not hundred. Say fifty, for distribution amongst his officers."
Devotee,Oh.,Prabhupāda, So that everyone will be satisfied.
Devotee,I think Ksirodakasayi has the information on that car business. Because he once inquired and got papers. He may have them here.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So make arrangement. At least two cars, nice cars."
Devotee,One car and onevan?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,One car and onevan?,Prabhupāda, Van? What is the use ofvan?
Devotee,"Well, they can carry many people, that's the thing, like asaṅkīrtanaparty.",Prabhupāda, Saṅkīrtanamay be six men. They can go in car.
Devotee,(laughs) Yeah.,Prabhupāda," And better for carrying our luggage, add to the car some small..."
Devotee,Trailer.,Prabhupāda," ...trailer, yes, two wheel. Oh, it will go."
Devotee,The advantage of thevanis that they can sleep in it.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,The advantage of avanis that it can be used for sleeping purposes also.,Prabhupāda," Sleeping purposes in India, tropical country, if you carry camp, if you want to sleep somewhere you just immediately set up a camp and pass night very comfortable. And you go on the field passing stool. Just catch up some watery place. (laughter) You can cook, you can take bath, you can wash your dishes, then put up on the trailer and go on."
Devotee,Mostly we'll be going to big...,Prabhupāda," I'll agree if you can send onevanalso, two cars and onevan."
Devotee,Mostly we'll be going to bigger cities anyway. The roads between big cities are all right. But if we go places...,Prabhupāda, Work sincerely and everything will be supplied byKṛṣṇa. Now take... (end)
