Devotee; Guest; Śyāmasundara; Guest,Where you are sitting?; I am sitting here so that I might give my right ear to you all. I haven't seen you before.; I'm Śyāmasundara.; (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes, it is your seat."
Guest,"Very good, very nice seat.",Prabhupāda," You can take it, this seat."
Guest,The camera should have operated on your beautifulsārī.It's very good. Who is the chief of your group? You or he?,Prabhupāda, (laughter) As you like.
Guest; Madhudviṣa; Guest,"He holds a big stick, so I'm asking.; Prabhupāda is the chief. He has given me the stick.; Where is my negro friend? He has not come?",Prabhupāda," Oh, he is not come. There was no place in the car. There were many negroes."
Guest; Madhudviṣa; Guest; Madhudviṣa; Guest; Madhudviṣa; Guest,"(aside:) Sit closer. You belong to this place? No. What place you belong to? (Hindi with other guest) It's a pretty long stick. Let me have a look at it first. It's wrapped in cloth. Oh, I see.; It is four bamboos.; Huh?; It is calledtri-daṇḍi,tridaṇḍi.; Tridaṇḍa.; Yes.; Tridaṇḍa.",Prabhupāda, This isVaiṣṇava.

Guest; Devotee; Guest; Girirāja,You don't look like that. I think that's not correct age. Surely you are fifty-six. (laughter) How many of you here...? How many are you here...? Will you sit nearer here?; I... This is your good ear?; Yes. This is my good ear. Yes.; I'll sit on the white bench.,Prabhupāda, Then you can sit on...

Guest,Or East Bengal?,Prabhupāda, My birthplace is in Calcutta.
Guest,Calcutta.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,Great and famous place. Looked after...,Prabhupāda, Where you are governor also.
Guest,Looked after very badly. (laughter),Prabhupāda, Lalaji was governor in West Bengal.
Guest,"How you have... Yes. I was called governor for some time there. I liked the place when I was there. They were all very kind. They had settled down after a lot of rioting and, and (indistinct), and all that, they had settled down.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"They were all very good to me. They looked upon me as a, an impartial man, which is a very great compliment in our country. Now you have undertaken a very great task. I am not competent to discuss or comment upon it.",Prabhupāda, No. I think you are the best man to comment upon it.
Guest,"True. Still, I am not presumptuous enough to comment on one who has actually taken up the work. That is the difference between thinking and doing. Thinking is easy. Doing requires inspiration, and you have taken it up.",Prabhupāda," I was thinking of taking up this task long, long ago. I wrote one letter toMahatmaGandhithat ""You have got influence all over the world, and you are acknowledged a man of spiritual understanding. Now you have gotsvarāṭ, you better retire and take up this preaching ofBhagavad-gītāall over the world."""
Guest,"He was doing if from the beginning, not exclusively that, but applying theBhagavad-gītāto everything that he was doing. He was doing it really, but you are referring to concentrated, exclusive...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,...teaching of the doctrines and way life described in...,Prabhupāda, Sometimes I requested Dr. Radhakrishnan also...
Guest,Huh?,Prabhupāda, ...when he was vice-president.
Guest,Radhakrishnan? Nowhere in comparison withGandhi.,Prabhupāda, No.
Guest,"Radhakrishnan, highly intellectual, good man, but he was more of a... There was no inspiration he gave.",Prabhupāda," No, no."
Guest,"God seems to have decided to spare him from that, from hard work.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (laughter)
Guest,"He was very happy, and he was very good and I love..., I have great love for him, and he was a very just man. He was a teacher of...",Prabhupāda, In Calcutta he was a professor...
Guest,"...politics, not of theBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"Now, would you allow me to think aloud...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Guest,...in the matter you have taken up?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"First of all, they are scattered all over the world, your society. Scattered all over the world. They do not live together, anywhere.",Prabhupāda, No. I have got different centers.
Guest,You have.,Prabhupāda, Yes. In different cities.
Guest,And they live together there?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. We have got devotees in each center, not less than twenty-five and up to two hundred."
Guest,"I see. Oh, as big as that.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"Now, taking up my thoughts on the crude difficulties of management. First of all there is the very crude necessity of getting money to run these institutions.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,And that means...,Prabhupāda," I may inform you, in this connection..."
Guest,Huh?,Prabhupāda, ...that we are spending at the present moment seventy to eighty thousand dollars per month.
Guest,"That's right. So whatever the exact amount may be, it's likely to be a big amount, and that means befriending people who will be prepared to part with the money...",Prabhupāda, Hard-earned money.
Guest,...the money that they worship. Eh? (laughter),Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"Money god is greater thanBrahmaand Śiva andViṣṇu, just about, unfortunately. The people have made an idol of gold and silver and letter of paper, paper making the promises of government...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,...which are never kept. (laughter),Prabhupāda," I was going to say, it is a fraud."
Guest,Fraud.,Prabhupāda, Māyā.
Guest,But that is...,Prabhupāda, It ismāyā.I give you piece of paper and you think on thousand rupees. This ismāyā.
Guest,"Yes. You see it depends on the credit to the man who gives the promise. Paper is mainly the document of credit. Governments have till now kept their credit, but now they have learned to disregard their promises also.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,So that is one of the main troubles.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"But I think any religious movement like yours, people think they can buy up the grace of God by giving some money. Right? So you won't find any difficulty in getting money, because there is air of sin in the world, and the sinful people think they can compromise by giving money. Let them give.",Prabhupāda, That is also good.
Guest,"Let them give. That..., but that is the smallest point. Another point is, I suppose in each institution, in each center, there are men as well as woman...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Guest,And they live together.,Prabhupāda, Not together. Woman's section is different.
Guest,Huh?,Prabhupāda, Women's section is different.
Guest,Different.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,It's very important...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"...because all religious organizations have floundered on scandal, and you will have to be very careful about that.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,This is what an old man has a right to tell you.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, from the very beginning, because in Western country the boys and girls, they intermingle very freely."
Guest,"Oh, yes, we know all that.",Prabhupāda, Yes...
Guest,We know for a fact.,Prabhupāda," ...and therefore I, as far as possible, I get them married."
Guest,"Yes. But that doesn't prevent permissive culture. It acts as a sort of guarantee (Prabhupāda laughs), as a sort of insurance against scandal. But scandals do come out.",Prabhupāda," Yes, and that is a..."
Guest,"So you are left with, that is another crude problem...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Guest,"...that you have to take great care about. The traditional life of separate living is safer for organization. So all right to have men and are married and then in family they can mix. There is no difficulty. But when you start the separate organization, against which people are ready to manufacture stories, then you will have to be much more careful.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,So that is one comment I make as an old man.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. You are very valuable. Yes."
Guest,That is a wise thing from an old man. That's one thing. Then these are minor matters. On the philosophy of action which you have taken...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,...of converting the people toSriKṛṣṇa...,Prabhupāda, Consciousness.
Guest,...to worship ofSriKṛṣṇa...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"...I wonder whether you will place more importance, I ask my friend, Mr.,...uh...",Prabhupāda, Girirāja.
Guest,"...Girirāja, whether it is theGītāthat you may stress on or theBhāgavatam.",Prabhupāda, Gītāis the preliminary study ofBhāgavatam.
Guest,"True, but inBhāgavatamthere is lots of danger, so far asSriKṛṣṇagoes. TheBhāgavatam, so far as it relates to the other incarnations ofMahā-ViṣṇuHimself, different, but so far asSriKṛṣṇagoes, it deals with a chapter of His life which can mislead people...",Prabhupāda, Yes. That we are very cautious.
Guest,Huh?,Prabhupāda, That we are very cautious.
Guest,You will have to be very cautious.,Prabhupāda, Yes. I was discussing this point...
Guest,"Generally, generally people begin to think, ""I amSriKṛṣṇa...""",Prabhupāda," Ah, that is nonsense."
Guest,"""...God.'' That is what happens.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"That will be danger. But so far as theGītāĀcārya's teachings, He is a different person. There's no reference to early life in Vyāsa'sBhagavad-gītā.TheBhagavad-gītāis simply about anācārya.Occasionally He says ""I amĪśvara,"" but He's anācāryaprimarily. I need not..., I am not trying to sermonize to you. I'm trying to explain what I feel.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"Very difficult doctrine of detachment. TheGītāĀcāryasayssannyāsais difficult, and you are likely to become a hypocrite if you, if you...",Prabhupāda, Mithyācāraḥsaucyate.
Guest,"...if you prematurely takesannyāsa.Therefore try and compromise the principles ofsannyāsa, that is to say of renunciation with worldly action, and, I mean, performance of duty, by performing the duties without caring for the results. That is the renunciation He has preached, I have understood.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"The defects are here that way which you will confirm, I have no doubt. But the question which I put to Girirāja was whether it would not have been better if you work from inside rather than make yourself a separate cult and organization. Separate organization, once you form, becomes like a person who is born. It gets his attachment, his ego, his everything. So the separate organization, like Mr. Banu, becomes an ego. He is fond of his own attachments, of his own interest, and so the organization must be looked after. The organization should succeed. The organization should succeed better than other organizations. There is (indistinct) among organizations. So all the egotistic weaknesses apply to organizations also. Therefore I was wondering whether it would not, if you had convinced that your mission was to spread theGītāĀcārya'steachings as to how to act with detachment and with faith in the grace of God, where you go wrong, could not be having better done without making yourself separate.",Prabhupāda," No. The thing is, when there is detachment, there must be another attachment."
Guest,Yes. To God.,Prabhupāda, Yes. But that is required.
Guest,Huh?,Prabhupāda, That is required. Just like...
Guest,"Yes. Attachment to... There is a Tamil, Kurul. You have heard of the name Kurul? Tamil (indistinct), makes this point very clear.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"If you wish to live without detachment, attach yourself to God.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,That will be the...,Prabhupāda, Paraṁdṛṣṭvānivartate[Bg. 9.59].
Guest,Yes.,Prabhupāda," After getting good attachment, one gives up the inferior attachment."
Guest,Right. That will better right. The attachment should be to God.,Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa.
Guest,"Kṛṣṇa,Govinda, es I will call Him.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Guest,"Attachment should be toGovinda, not to an organization.",Prabhupāda, Yes. No.Govindais absolute.Govindaand Govinda's organization the same.Govindais absolute.
Guest,"I don't want to discuss it, I told you. I'm not competent to discuss. I'm just telling you what I think.",Prabhupāda," No. I'm also answering this point. Just likeKṛṣṇa, His name, His form, His pastimes, His entourage, they are all the same. Otherwise, what is the benefit of chanting Kṛṣṇa's name? Suppose I am thirsty just now. If I simply chant the name of water, ""water,'' I'll not be satisfied. Water is required, actual substance. But when you chant ""Kṛṣṇa,'' ifKṛṣṇaname is different fromKṛṣṇa, then you... (end)"
Madhudviṣa,No. (pause) He doesn't give the receipt number. He says... [break],Prabhupāda," ...all the educated men.Yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhastattadevetarojanaḥ[Bg.3.21]. If the, who is called, elite society appreciate, then ordinary people will also appreciate. Before myGuruMaharaja, I mean, Bhaktisiddhānta's..., Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, Lord Caitanya's cult was considered by the higher class as it is the business of the low-class men. Even Vivekananda remarked that ""It is the religion of sex,'' because they saw that thesahajiyās, they discussed thisrāsa-līlāand have illicit connection with woman. So therefore they took it as the religion of sex. Vivekananda. But now..."
Guest,(Hindi),Prabhupāda," These are the remark. And now we have to establish this, that this is the only way to reach God. You have to become scholar, philosopher, worker, practical behavior. And that is the fact. Otherwise whyKṛṣṇasayssarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇam[Bg.18.66]?You have to prove it. AndBhāgavatasays,dharmaḥprojjhita-kaitavaḥ: ""Except surrendering toKṛṣṇa, anything, that is simply cheating,'' cheating,kaitavaḥ. Cheating religion. This is challenged by God, ""Cheating religion."" We have to save people from the cheating type of religion, cheating type of religion, cheating type ofdharma. It is so important movement. So this is very good thought of high-court judges. He has stated also, just before that,vicāra. You marked?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Caitanyeradayārakathākarahavicāra.Vicārameans statement. Just try to understand the mercy of LordCaitanya, and give your judgement. This is not a sentimental, as people take it as a sentimental. Most scientific, logical. So how they like that slides?"
Girirāja,Very much. I think we may have a brief slide show tonight also.,Prabhupāda, Yes. You have got all the slides?
Girirāja,"We have many slides of paintings, of different activities... [break]",Prabhupāda," ...have no attachment. These are all nonsense. You cannot be (indistinct). A living being, to become desireless, how you can? I am living. I am not a dead body. Desire should be to satisfyKṛṣṇa. Attachment should be for Him. That's all. You have to change. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You have now attachment for sense gratification, desire for sense gratification. This has to be changed. Purification of desire, purification of attachment.Tatparatvenanirmalam[Cc.Madhya19.170]. Eyes, because it is diseased, you don't pluck out. This is nonsense. Cure the eyes of the disease, then you will see things right. TheMāyāvādīphilosophy is pluck out the eyes.Buddhaphilosophy is make it zero. That is also same thing, plucking out. Our philosophy is ""No. Cure it.'' That is the difference. It is very simple. Which one is better? Just like a man is suffering from disease, fever, and doctor gives him medicine. He dies. Then the patient's guardian says, ""Sir, he is dead now. You have given some medicine, he is dead.'' ""That's all right, fever is gone. Fever is gone. Never mind he is dead.'' (laughter) These rascal philosophy statement is like that. Make zero. Make imperson. Then the difficulties of personality... Because they have got very bad experience of personality here. He had to become minister, he has become king and this and that, householder, all botheration. So make imperson. That's all. Negation. Personality is giving us trouble, so make imperson. God must be imperson, because as soon as we have person, there is trouble. They have got experience. (indistinct) as soon as they (indistinct), make it zero, then there is no pains and pleasure. The body, becauseBuddhaphilosophy does not give any idea of soul-bodily concept. The body is combination of matter, so dismantle this combination. Just like you have got a skyscraper building, so you have to pay tax. Break it, make it zero, so no tax. This is philosophy. Do you follow? You have got a very big building, so you have to pay tax. To save tax, break the building. No more taxes. No more pains and pleasure. No more anxiety. That isBuddhaphilosophy. That means these philosophers are called fools and rascal, less intelligent. Would you like this advice, that you have got a big building, just like in London there is a big building, and he has got a policy anyway that he does not allow any tenant. Largest building in London, to save tax. But his point is different. In Bengali there is adage that (Bengali), that a man's utensils were stolen by a thief, so he became very angry, that ""A thief has taken all my utensil. All right, I shall not purchase utensil. I shall take food on the floor. I shall take food on the floor. No more utensils. I shall not keep plates and utensils any more. I shall take food on the floor.'' This is philosophy. [break] We don't believe in so-called nonviolence, nonattachment, zero. No. We believe in everything, but if there is required violence, fight, ""Yes, come on.'' Yes.Arjuna. No consideration, ""The other side my grandfather, my father, or this or that.Kṛṣṇawants this fight to kill them all.''Gopīs, at dead of night they went toKṛṣṇa: ""Kṛṣṇa wants us. Oh, we don't care for all this social convention. Kick out. Let us go.''PrahlādaMaharaja, Nṛsiṁhadeva killing his father, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇais taking pleasure in killing my father. That is all right. (laughter) That I don't protest.'' He could have said, ""My dear Lord, please do not kill my father.'' Immediately he would have been saved from that. (phone rings)"
Devotee,Could bePuriMaharaja.,Prabhupāda," Go, go, go. So that is our point.BaliMaharaja, he saw that his so-called Śukrācārya,casteGoswāmī, is checking him to offer anything to Vāmanadeva. ""Oh, I don't like you. I reject you. I don't want a spiritual master like you, who is checking me for offering toKṛṣṇa.'' This is amahājana.PrahlādaMaharajabecamemahājana.Gopīsbecame the topmost devotee. Why? ForKṛṣṇa. They neglected any social convention, this, that. ""No.Kṛṣṇamust be satisfied.'' That is the most... That isKṛṣṇaconscious. [break] (telephone conversation in Hindi withPuriMaharaja) [break]"
Śyāmasundara,"So we, we should get tickets today...",Prabhupāda," Yes, we will get tickets."
Śyāmasundara,...for leaving on...,Prabhupāda, On seventeenth.
Śyāmasundara,...seventeenth?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. We shall pay for his expenditure.
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara,AndNityānanda?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Śyāmasundara,Did he say anything about that Nit...,Prabhupāda," Ah,Nityānandais coming today."
Śyāmasundara,Good.,Prabhupāda," I have asked (indistinct), you should also go. So now on the seventeenth we must start."
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Make arrangements like that.
Śyāmasundara,Some party can go tomorrow.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Śyāmasundara,Rest on seventeenth. And we will see if there is airline connection.,Prabhupāda," If airline is not possible, we will go by train or... [break] ...preach like this."
Mālatī,Haribol.,Prabhupāda, Oh. (laughing)
Mālatī,Jaya. It was very good meeting (?).,Prabhupāda," That for the fifty years they are here, nobody can find.GaudīyaMaṭhais known as Indian temple. That's all."
Śyāmasundara,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, No preaching.
Śyāmasundara,He's making publicity up there.,Prabhupāda, Yes. He can take all these placards. Yes. We have got remaining placards?
Śyāmasundara,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda," Only point is, ""Make it zero. And so long you are living, enjoy as you like, because afterwards you are going to be zero. There is no responsibility. So you gratify your senses to the fullest extent.'' That's all. Just like, I do not know, I have never hanged, but anyone who is going to be hanged, he is offered that ""Whatever you want, you can enjoy.'' Is that..."
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, ...fact?
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So their philosophy, ""You are going to be hanged. Now you can enjoy whatever you like.'' So this philosophy, that because theMāyāvādīphilosophy is impersonal, zero, therefore people don't care for sin. ""Enjoy life. You shall finish."""
Devotee,"There's the story of a man who is being hanged and they said, ""You can have whatever you want.'' So he said, ""Whatever I want?'' So they said, ""Yes.'' So he says, ""I want ten more years life.""",Prabhupāda, We don't say whatever you want. You enjoy. Gratify your senses as much as you like.
Mālatī,Prabhupāda? What class of impersonalists are worshiping thePuruṣa-sūkta?,Prabhupāda, Hum?
Mālatī,What class of impersonalists are worshiping the universal form?,Prabhupāda," Well, universal form is not impersonal. That is personal. That is also manifestation ofKṛṣṇa."
Mālatī,But you say that... In one of your purports you are saying that the impersonalists are worshiping the universal form.,Prabhupāda, They are advised.
Śyāmasundara; Mālatī,"Ah, advised to worship.; They are advised to worship.",Prabhupāda," Nobody is advised to... There is no worship for impersonalists, there is no..."
