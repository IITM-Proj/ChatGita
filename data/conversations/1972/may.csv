Martin,I studied one.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Martin,I studied one.,Prabhupāda, One only?
Martin,"One. (laughs) I, I concentrated on one. I learned of some of the (indistinct), (loud crack of thunder in background) maybe a thousand.",Prabhupāda," Nine hundred thousand, exact number. (aside:) Bring that socket."
Devotee,"Oh, this? (indistinct)",Prabhupāda," Jalajānava-lakṣānisthāvarālakṣa-viṁśati. And 2,000,000 of leaves and plants, botany, botanical.Jalajānava-lakṣānisthāvarālakṣa-viṁśati,kṛmayorudra-saṅkhyakāḥ. Insects, there are 1,100,000 forms. (Sanskrit) Then (Sanskrit). From insect, they become flies and birds. (Sanskrit) One million. Then from birds, the beasts come, four-legged. (Sanskrit). Three million species of beasts. Then from beasts, the human form comes—either from monkey or from lion or from cows. Out of these three,sattva-guṇa,rajo-guṇa,tamo-guṇa. Those who are coming throughrajo-guṇa, their last birth before human form of birth is lion. And those who are coming in the form ignorance, Darwin's father-in-law, (laughs) monkey, and ignorance. And those who are coming in goodness, their last form of birth is cow. So this is our scientific information from theVedas. We haven't got to make research. Everything is there. That is Vedic knowledge. They have got already everything written there. The astronomy, everything is written there; simply you have to calculate. Astrology, we say simply mathematical calculation. If the moon is in this position and the other stars is in this position, the effect will be like this and the result will be like this. Like that. So you haven't got to make search or research. It is already there. Similarly, this Darwin's theory is there in two lines. (Sanskrit)Asati,asatimeans eighty.Caturameans four, eighty and fourlakṣāṇi,lakhs, 400,000. Eighty-four hundred thousand, that means eighty million, four hundred thousand.(Sanskrit)Jīvameans living entity;jātimeans species.Jīva-jātiṣu,brahmadbhiḥ. The living entity is wandering or transmigrating from aquatics to trees, plants, then insect, then birds, then beasts. In this way the last is human form of life.Brahmadbhiḥ,brahmadbhiḥ, wandering. (Sanskrit), last he is getting (Sanskrit), by the evolution of birth. Now this form is for understandingGovinda, God. The other forms, they cannot. So if in this form the living entity does not contactGovinda... ContactingGovindameans surrendering untoGovinda. AsKṛṣṇasays, ""Surrender unto Me.''Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19]. So after many, many, many millions of births, when one is actually in full knowledge, he surrenders toKṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Then he goes back to home, back to Godhead. That is our program,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Martin,So there's something higher than human form?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Demigods. (Sanskrit) Generally three divisions: demigods, human beings and other than human beings."
Martin,Primitive cavemen?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Martin,Primitive cavemen?,Prabhupāda," No, not only cavemen: the animals, birds, beasts, other than."
Martin,"Oh, I see. (more thunder)",Prabhupāda," But this human form of life is better than demigods' life because demigods, they are materially very opulent. Just like when the Americans came in India, they thought, ""Demigods.'' Is it not?"
Martin,The Indians thought. Hm.,Prabhupāda," Because they're better looking, good looking, intelligent, powerful. Similarly, just like this controller or director of this rain department isIndra. This thundering, it is under his direction this thundering is going on. He throws the thunderbolts and cracks the mountain, and then we get chunks. That is his business. As in government there are different departments, similarly, God has got different departments, and the in-charge of that department is demigod. Creation, that'sBrahma; sustenance or maintenance, Himself,Viṣṇu; and dissolution, LordSiva."
Martin,How is human life better than that?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Martin,How is the human life better than the demigod?,Prabhupāda," Better than in this way, that just like here also on this planet, those who are richer section, they particularly do not care to know what is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. They're proud, puffed-up for material opulence. ""Ah, what is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Let us enjoy drink.'' That is their position. So it is a curse for them. Their richness is a curse for them, that they cannot adore such a nice movement. The middle class section, they are being attracted. Similarly, the demigods, they have got very, very high standard of life, duration of life, beauty, opulence, facilities, so generally they forget. Not forget; they are servant. Just like government servant does not mean a devotee. So they are devotee, officially devotee. They, they offer their obeisances toKṛṣṇa. (Sanskrit), worship by LordSivaorBrahma, but their devotion is conditional because they're posted in such high post, so they may remain in their post. In this way, exchange. But in the human society you'll find devotees, there is no question of exchange; it is simply love. (more thunder)"
Martin,These demigods are what we call angels?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,So how does science fit in with all of this?,Prabhupāda, Hm? Let him speak.
Martin,This is why I'm here. I know science...,Prabhupāda, Hm? He can...
Martin,"I, I know a bit of where it's going, and I don't find it compelling, fulfilling.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Martin,It's just the empty... (indistinct) one half of the world.,Prabhupāda, Scientist business is he can become a great devotee. Just like...
Devotee,"Si,si. (Yes, yes.)",Prabhupāda," Law of gravity... The big, big planets are floating in the air. Now you can explain how it is it's floating. The hint is already there in theBhagavad-gītā, that He enters.Viṣṭabhyāidaṁkṛtsnamekāṁśena sthitojagat[Bg.10.42],(Sanskrit)that ""I enter into this universe, and by My prowess they are floating.'' These hints are there. Now you are a scientist; if you are actually devotee, then you try to explain from your scientific explanation that this floating is possible because God has entered within it. That is your duty. And because you're scientist, your explanation from the scientific point of view, how God has entered, how He is acting, that will be very well received by the public. So that will be great service. Actually that is the fact. It is already stated there that ""I enter.'' We can understand. Yes, we believe. I'll explain. Just like that balloon. What is that gas? Hydrogen gas?"
Martin,Helium.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Martin,Helium gas.,Prabhupāda," Helium gas. So that helium gas has entered within the balloon and it is floating. (laughter) So if the helium gas can float, cannot God float? If helium gas has so much power, God is less than helium gas or He is more than helium gas? So what is the difficulty to understand? God says, ""I enter.'' So similarly, the helium gas enters and it makes possible that it floats. So what is the difficulty to understand? I see in my eyes. So He can become big helium gas. Just likeKṛṣṇasays,raso 'hamapsukaunteya:[Bg.7.8] ""I am the taste of the water.'' Water is important. We are drinking water for the taste. That taste isKṛṣṇa. Similarly, if you explain this law of gravitation, which we have discovered, isKṛṣṇa, prove it by your scientific knowledge, that will be your service. Actually that is a fact. That is the fact. But you have to explain, just like I have given you this example. This is scientific. As you can float a balloon by creating helium gas, so there must be some gas like that;Kṛṣṇaenters into each and every planet or universe and it floats, that's all. They, not only the planets are floating, the universes are also floating. So you accept this theory or not? If not, clearly explain."
Martin,"I, I, I cannot reject it.",Prabhupāda, That's...
Martin,Because you know more about it than I do.,Prabhupāda," Thank you very much. That should be the attitude. That is the way of understanding.Upadekṣyantitejñānaṁjñāninastattva-darśinaḥ. Those who areTattva-darśiḥ, those who have seen the truth, we have to take knowledge from them. That is the direction in theBhagavad-gītā, not from the third-class men. One who has seen, one who has known, you have to take knowledge from him,tattva-darśiḥ.Tadviddhipraṇipātenaparipraśnenasevayā[Bg.4.34]. You have to understand by surrendering, by rendering service and by question, three things. You cannot question simply. There must be service and surrender; then question will be nice. And if all of a sudden you come and question, that answer will not be sufficient. So I am drinking this water because there is taste. At this time, if you can give me some other juice, I'll not like. I'll like to take, drink water, because there is particular taste that will satisfy my thirst. That thirst-quenching taste isKṛṣṇa. So immediately you can rememberKṛṣṇa, ""Here isKṛṣṇa.'' This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Raso 'hamapsukaunteya[Bg.7.8]. There is no need of seeingKṛṣṇa. You can perceiveKṛṣṇawhile drinking water if you have got such power of perception. And the hints are already there in theBhagavad-gītā. You can argue, ""Where isKṛṣṇa? I do not seeKṛṣṇa. How can I...'' Well,Kṛṣṇasays, ""All right, you try to realize Me in this way. While you drink water you know that taste is Myself.'' So you can see or perceiveKṛṣṇaby drinking water. So everyone is drinking water. Who cannot perceiveKṛṣṇa? What is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa's giving hints, ""Worship Me like that.'' And God, at the present moment, God can be seen eye-to-eye, but He can be perceivedanumananda(?). What is that word?Parasya...?"
Devotee,Parasya.(Sanskrit),Prabhupāda," (Sanskrit)So at the present moment we can understand God byanubhava(?): ""Here is God.'' The hint is given by God thatraso 'hamapsukaunteya, that ""I am the taste of water.'' You cannot create this taste. You can make water, hydrogen-oxygen mixing, but you cannot create the taste so that that water may be taken. Is that possible?"
Martin,"It is possible to make water, and I rely on you to say that it is not possible to make the taste.",Prabhupāda," That... Just like from perspiration we are also creating water, but nobody is going to drink that water. Nobody is coming to lick my body, ""Here is water.'' (laughter) That is not possible."
Devotee,"Even if they mix hydrogen and oxygen to get water, still, where does the hydrogen and oxygen come from?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Wherefrom the chemical comes? Such vast sea water, so where you got so much chemical? Then the next question, that Who supplies the chemicals?"
Martin,I've been there before. They all come down the same. They all come to the same place. You said that it is possible to see God eye-to-eye.,Prabhupāda, Yeah.
Martin,How can this be done?,Prabhupāda, You have to be qualified.
Martin,How can you be qualified?,Prabhupāda," This is the process going on in thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. They become devotee, follow the rules and regulations, the prescribed method, you'll see God. You'll see constantly, twenty-four hours.Santaḥsadaivahṛdayeṣuvilokayanti,premāñjana cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena[Bs. 5.38]. If you have developed such devotion and love for God, then you will see always God. Just like if you have got a child whom you very much love, you'll see the child always in front of you, always. It is due to love. Similarly, you have to develop love forKṛṣṇaand you'll see Him. He can be seen by love, not by your method. He is not under any method, but He is under love. So you have to develop love and then you'll see. (aside:) There is no flavor. Is it any flavor?"
Martin; Devotee,It's very faint.; Mexican incense.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Devotee,Christian incense.,Prabhupāda, So all science of God is described inBhagavad-gītā.
Devotee,"This morning you said thatKṛṣṇais the original scientist because..., because He is a scientist then we can have our science.",Prabhupāda," Yes. The, ah... Do you accept it He is the original scientist?"
Martin,"I can accept the fact thatKṛṣṇa, being God, created everything which science studies now.",Prabhupāda," Yes, right. That's right. That is the fact. That is the fact. So despite my becoming a scientist, I am a subordinate scientist. Our, my scientific research is going on under the direction ofKṛṣṇa. Because the experiment which you are making in the laboratory, the ingredients, they are produced fromKṛṣṇa. The mind with which you are working, that is produced byKṛṣṇa. The direction you are receiving fromKṛṣṇa. Therefore when you prepare something, that is Kṛṣṇa's production.Kṛṣṇais indirect cause and you are direct cause. The other day while coming on the plane you told me that they are trying to make copy of the brain of..."
Devotee,Einstein.,Prabhupāda," Einstein. So still, if you can copy, even if you can copy, you are not the original scientist, because that brain of Einstein is already created. So original creation is God's. So you can imitate. So you are imitator scientist. Is it not?"
Martin,It's true.,Prabhupāda," Who has created the brain of Professor Einstein? You have not created. You are trying to make a xerox copy, that's all. But the original is already there. Now who has created the original brain? Then you have to go to God. But you have not created. It is not my men(?). If man could create such brain, then, ""Ah, never mind, the professor has died. We create another person like.'' That you cannot. So even if you are able to imitate, you are not the supreme scientist. First of all it is doubtful. So accepting that you will be able to copy or xerox copy of Einstein's brain, that does not give you the credit. The credit is already there, God's credit. At least we shall not give you any credit. We shall speak that the original brain is created by God. You cannot create. If you had the power to create, then there was no necessity of copying. You could create better brain. That you haven't got. You are trying to take xerox copy from that brain. Just like big, big aeroplanes are flying, but their, the shape is made after the bird. The original shape bird is created by God. He has got the same type of machine even within an insect, small insect flying. You can create a small aeroplane like that. That is not possible. Then what is your credit? Here is God's credit, a small fly, near water. You create it. You see? You can create a big, but you cannot a small. Therefore you are incapable. But God can create the biggest and the smallest.Aṇor aṇīyān mahatomahīyān. He can create the greater than the greatest and the smaller than the smallest."
Devotee,A big airplane cannot reproduce another airplane.,Prabhupāda," You cannot create male aeroplane and female aeroplane so that you haven't got to manufacture a third one. The third one is produced. Why third one? Millions. And then from millions, another millions, another million. That is God's creation. That means He has got different energies. He pushes on one button of one energy and the production goes on.(Sanskrit)These are the Vedic explanation. His energies are so subtle. Just like nowadays electronic television button, you press, and thousands and thousands of miles away something is happening, you see. So if it is materially possible, it is nothing but exhibition of the energy of the human brain. So if human brain can exhibit such wonderful activities, how much God can do? He has got better brain, that's all, or the best brain. If you have got brain, that's all right, but He has got the best brain,param. Therefore He is calledparampuruṣa,parameśvara.Paramameans the best, the supreme. God is like you, like me. He has got also two hands, two legs,Kṛṣṇa. But His brain is different. Just like you are scientist; your brain is better than me, or his brain is better than you, and his brain is better than him. In this way you go on searching. When you find the brain which is no more better, that is God. That is God. As you are finding out better brain than you, he is better than his, he better than this—you go on researching—when you find out some brain which surpasses everyone and nobody surpasses Him, that is God. This is our definition of God. How can I deny it? We don't accept blindly anyone as God, incarnation of God. We want to see who has got the best brain, who has got the best opulence, who has got the best beauty, who has got the best knowledge, who has got the best friend. All combined together, if we find in some person, that is God. That we have found inKṛṣṇa; therefore He is God."
Martin,But how can I know with my inferior brain...,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Martin,...who has the best brain?,Prabhupāda, That you can understand. Just like you are a scientist friend. You can do something which I cannot do. That much I must accept that you have got better brain. What is the difficulty?
Martin,But... How can I know?,Prabhupāda," You can know directly that ""He is doing better than me.'' What is the difficulty? I can see... Just like all my disciples, they are following me. Why? Because they understand that ""Our spiritual master explains about God better than us.'' Therefore they are surrendering. I am not bribing them. They are not fools. They have got very nice brain to act. So they accept me as the spiritual master brain because they understand it that ""He can explain about God better than me.'' Where is the difficulty? These, all my disciples, surrenders unto me because they have found in me a better brain in explaining what is God. Direct perception. There is no question of indirect understanding. It is direct understanding. And theVedasalso advises that ""Go to a better man,''śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham[MU1.2.12], ""one who heard better and wise from the Vedic knowledge, andbrahma, as a result of it he has become fully devoted toKṛṣṇa,''brahma-niṣṭham. These are the qualifications of spiritual master. His knowledge is perfect according to the Vedic injunction, and by having that knowledge he has become a perfect devotee of the Lord. These two things are to be seen. Then he is a spiritual master."
Martin,But there are many spiritual masters in the world. Each says...,Prabhupāda," Each says, but you have to judge. Just like when you go to purchase two shillings' worth goods, you go to different stores. Everyone says, ""Oh, my thing is very nice.'' But you have to judge which one is best. That depends on you. If you are a fool, then somebody will cheat you. And if you are not a fool, then you will know... Just like these rascals, they call themselves God. Such a fool can cheat another fool only. But one who knows what is God, he'll not accept it. One who knowsKṛṣṇa, he'll not accept him as God. He'll immediately compare, ""What you have done likeKṛṣṇaor better thanKṛṣṇathat I shall accept you God? We have already our God,Kṛṣṇa. Now you prove that you are better thanKṛṣṇaor equal toKṛṣṇa.'' That he cannot, so why I shall accept him as God? Why shall I accept him as spiritual master? That depends on your intelligence. If you are less intelligent, then you'll be cheated by this false God. So everyone has got intelligence, individuality, power of understanding, so you should try to use them, and then you can understand."
Devotee; Martin; Devotee; Martin,"I'd like to ask what do the scientists explain is the origin of life? Do they have any explanation how life is caused?; Oh, scientists concern themselves with the process, not the reason. Right now, scientists are spending a tremendous amount of time duplicating this process, trying to be able to produce life in the laboratory. This now, they are saying that thus they will be able to say that this is how life started at the beginning of the world. It does not take... Scientists don't concern themselves with why life started, just how, what method.; What do they think, how it started?; Oh, they think life started by the effect of the atmosphere...",Prabhupāda," Then the atmosphere is the cause. Then next question is, Who created the atmosphere? [break]"
Martin,This doesn't... This is why I feel science... I don't feel...,Prabhupāda, They have not found out the ultimate cause. They take a process which is going in the middle way; therefore their science is imperfect. But our science is perfect. We have found out the ultimate cause.
Devotee,What is the definition of science?,Prabhupāda, Perfect knowledge.
Devotee,Perfect knowledge.,Prabhupāda, Is it not?
Martin,I don't know.,Prabhupāda, You do not know what is the meaning of science?
Martin,"No, I don't.",Prabhupāda," Then why you call science? How do you call ""This is scientific""?"
Martin,I can only give you my definition of science. Science is that endeavor of human beings by which they attempt to find out why things happen and how they happen.,Prabhupāda," That means perfect knowledge. Ah, I am seeing that thisroseflower is growing, but I do not know how it is growing. If I know perfectly how it is growing, that is science. We know that, how it is growing.Bījaṁmāṁsarva-bhūtānāṁ[Bg.7.10]. The seed of thisrosetree isKṛṣṇa. All kinds of seeds areKṛṣṇa. Therefore, from one seed you find a tree is growing from which a perfectroseof yellow color is coming. And another tree, a perfectroseof red color is coming or variety of color is coming. The seed is different. Otherwise the earth is the one, the water is the one, but because the seed is different, therefore different plants are coming and different results are coming. But the seeds areKṛṣṇa. This is our observation. You cannot create the seed. You cannot create in your laboratory the seed of... What is that tree?"
Devotee,Banyan? Banyan tree?,Prabhupāda," Banyan tree. There is small seed, very small. It contains the potency of a big banyan tree. You cannot create such seed. You create something, just like you are creating vitamin tablets. You are proposing that ""No more eating required. You simply take some vitamin tablet.'' Is it not? Similarly, you create some tablet and sow it in the earth and big banyan tree comes. Then I will accept you. (laughter)"
Martin,"You, you say that... [break] ...who created this knowledge that this flower and the banyan tree isKṛṣṇa. What place in the divine scheme do such great names asBuddha, Jesus, Muhammad have?",Prabhupāda," Yes.Buddha, we accept him as incarnation, as expansion ofKṛṣṇa. He'sKṛṣṇaworking asBuddha, LordBuddha.Keśavadhṛtabuddhaśarīra. He has accepted body ofBuddha. That is our conception of LordBuddha."
Martin,And Jesus Christ and Muhammad?,Prabhupāda, Everyone.
Martin,They were all the reincarnation ofKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Martin,I see.,Prabhupāda," Yadyadvibhūti. Any, anyone who is showing some extraordinary power, he is supposed to be incarnation of Kṛṣṇa's energy.Yadyadvibhūtimatsattvaṁmamatejo'ṁśa-sambhavam. The brilliant energy. He represents the brilliant energy ofKṛṣṇa. And the energy is not different from the energetic. (aside:) Hm. What is that?"
Devotee,I just said that this is a very good sound track of your speaking—this chanting and...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Martin,"Can a true devotee come face-to-face with God through the teachings ofBuddha, the teachings of Christ?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Teachings of Christ, teaching ofBuddha, they are meant for a particular type of men. Generally it is meant for everyone, but specifically for a particular type of men. Just like LordBuddha, he preachedahiṁsā. They were a particular type of men. Lord Jesus Christ also preached to a particular type of men. ""Thou shall not kill.'' That means they were killing. Is it not? If I say, ""Thou shall not steal,'' that means you are thief, you are stealing. So a kind of preaching among the thieves and a kind of teaching among the philosophers must be different. That is the difference. LordBuddhaisKṛṣṇa, Lord Jesus Christ wasKṛṣṇaincarnation, but they were preaching to a different type of people. Therefore you'll find difference of Lord Jesus Christ teaching, Buddha's teaching, Kṛṣṇa's teaching. Kṛṣṇa's teaching also is there, which is also Buddha's teaching. But more than that, because the persons amongst whom He was teaching, they were far, far elevated than the thieves and the rogues. That is the difference. Just like I am pushing on thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, I am doing so many things which sometimes my Godbrothers out of envy criticize. But I know what is the circumstances how to do it. They do not know it. I know my business. So that is their fault. Their ownbuddhibusiness, then simply criticize ""How he is acting.'' Find out some fault. Just like LordBuddhawas criticized by the Vedicbrāhmaṇas, ""Oh, you are stopping animal sacrifice? It is already in theVedas. Because it is sacrifice, the animal is also sacrificed, so how you can stop animal sacrifice?'' But LordBuddha,nindasiyajña-vidherahahaśruti-jātam.Śruti-jātam. In theVedasthere is recommendation for animal sacrifice, but he began to deride. So his business was to deride the Vedic principles, that ""I do not care for theseVedas.'' Therefore Buddha's religion was not accepted in India. He criticized. He criticized the Vedic principles. In the Vedic principles there is recommendation for animal sacrifice, and he criticized, ""This is not good. Don't do this.'' Therefore it is criticism. Vedic injunction should be accepted as it is. You cannot criticize. Then there is no Vedic authority. So therefore he defied Vedic authorities. As such, he was not accepted, strictly followers of theVedas. But he has got a different purpose. The ordinary man cannot understand. But one who is devotee, he knows that why he has done this. Therefore they offer their obeisances,keśavadhṛta-buddha-śarīrajayajagadīśahare. A devotee does not accept the philosophy ofBuddhabut accepts him as incarnation of LordKṛṣṇaand offers obeisances. This is our position. We offer obeisances to LordBuddhaas incarnation ofKṛṣṇa,keśavadhṛta-buddha-śarīrajayajagadīśahare. This is our study of knowledge."
Devotee,What class of men did LordCaitanyateach about?,Prabhupāda, Those who acceptKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Devotee,He preached among the devotees.,Prabhupāda," His preaching begins from surrendering toKṛṣṇa.Yāredekhatārekaha'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa[Cc.Madhya7.128].Kṛṣṇaupadeśais that Kṛṣṇa's asking everyone to surrender unto Him. So one who has surrendered untoKṛṣṇa, he can understand Lord Caitanya's teaching.Jīverasvarūpahayanityerakṛṣṇa-dāsa[Cc.Madhya20.108]. He begins His teachings from the point when one accepts that ""I am eternal servant ofKṛṣṇa."""
Martin,"This chanting process is directed to everyone, or just those who...",Prabhupāda," No, everyone. By chanting he'll come to this point. When his heart will be cleansed, then he will come to this point to surrender toKṛṣṇa. We initiate a person, not that he is already on that standard, but we are educating him by the process, how to come to that standard."
Devotee,Beginning when one takessannyāsa?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,"Beginning when one takessannyāsainitiation? It doesn't necessarily mean he's a controller of senses, is that right? Gradually he may rise up to...",Prabhupāda," Yes. No. Asannyāsīis already qualified. Then (indistinct). The first beginning is chanting. If he follows the regulative principles and chants sixteen rounds, that is his qualification. And by that process, he'll come to the point of full surrender. Then we give him the second initiation. And when he's actually engaged in the service of the Lord heart and soul, then we give himsannyāsa."
Devotee; Martin,"Do you have any more questions?; No, no. You've more than filled my cup.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Martin,"You have filled my cup, more than filled.",Prabhupāda, Thank you very much. [break]
Devotee,"I have one question I wanted to ask you. In Hawaii you said that the ocean was necessary in order to make the rain fall on the land, as a reservoir for fresh water, and that the salt was there to preserve the water from becoming bad.",Prabhupāda, So?
Devotee,So such huge body of water is required?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee; Martin; Devotee,The oceans cover how much of the earth?; Three-fifths.; Three-fifths of the earth's surface is ocean water. So that much is required to water two-fifths land?,Prabhupāda," No. The ocean is gradually... Water is required. Water is required. In our India, if somebody spends extravagantly, so it is compared with water: ""Oh, you are spending like water.'' (end)"
Devotee (1),"(readingKṛṣṇa,The Supreme Personality of Godhead, chapter ""Songs By the Gopīs"") ""Although the lotus flowers are so beautiful, without Your glance they fade away. Similarly, without You we are also dying. Actually we are neither...""",Prabhupāda," This building, it was a Christian church. Nobody was there. It was a barren desert. And sinceKṛṣṇahas come here, you see? Same business. Is it not the fact? Same religion, the same. It was a church, but because there was noKṛṣṇa, it was a barren land. This is a fact. Nobody was coming there; therefore they sold it off: ""It is useless.'' That's a fact. Similarly, everyone can bringKṛṣṇaat his home by becoming a devotee. There will be opulence. There is no question of committing suicide out of frustration. So many men, so many actors, out of frustration, committing suicide. They want to die. But if they takeKṛṣṇaandKṛṣṇaconsciousness, immediately everything will be there. Not thatKṛṣṇawas present there and not present here. He is present here. The Deity is present here. And if you think otherwise, thenKṛṣṇawill be (indistinct). If you think thatKṛṣṇais absent, then everything is lost."
Devotee (1),"(continues reading) ""Actually we are neither Your wives or slaves. You never spent any money for us, yet we are simply attracted by Your glance. Now if we die without receiving Your glance, You will be responsible for our deaths. Certainly the killing of women is a great sin, and if You do not come to see us and we die, You will suffer the reactions of sin. Please come and see us. Do not think that one can be killed only by weapons. We are being killed Your absence. You should consider how You are responsible for killing women. We are always grateful to You because You have protected us many times...""",Prabhupāda, This is the feeling of separation. Such feeling everyone should... (aside:) Go on.
Devotee (1),"""...from the poisonous water of theYamunā, from the serpentKāliya, from Bakāsura, from the anger ofIndraand his torrents of rain, from forest fire and so many other things. You are the greatest and most powerful of all. It is wonderful that You have protected us from so many dangers. We are surprised You are neglecting us at this moment. DearKṛṣṇa, dear friend, we know very well that You are not actually the son of motherYaśodāor the cowherd manNandaMahārāja. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supersoul of all living entities. You have, out of Your own causeless mercy, appeared in this world, requested by LordBrahmafor the protection of the world. It is by Your kindness only that You have appeared in the dynasty ofYadu. O best of the dynasty ofYadu, if anyone afraid of this materialistic way of life takes shelter of Your lotus feet, You never deny him protection. Your movements are sweet, and You are independent, touching the goddess of fortune with one hand and in the other bearing a lotus flower. That is Your extraordinary feature. Please, therefore, come before us and bless us with the lotus flower in Your hand. DearKṛṣṇa, You are the killer of all the fears of the inhabitants ofVṛndāvana. You are the supremely powerful hero, and we know that You can kill the unnecessary pride of Your devotees, as well as the pride of women like us, simply by Your beautiful smile.""",Prabhupāda," Unnecessary pride is very bad. ""Oh, I have become very advanced inKṛṣṇaconsciousness.'' That we should never think."
Devotee (1),"""We are simply Your maidservants and slaves. Please, therefore, accept us by showing us Your lotuslike beautiful face. DearKṛṣṇa, actually we have become very lusty, having been touched by Your lotus feet. Your lotus feet certainly kill all kinds of sinful activities of devotees who have taken shelter there. You are so kind that even the ordinary animals take shelter under Your lotus feet. Your lotus feet are also the residence of the goddess of fortune, yet You dance on the head of theKāliyaserpent with them. Now we are requesting You to kindly place Your lotus feet on our breasts and pacify our lusty desires to touch You. O Lord, Your attractive eyes, like the lotus, are so nice and pleasing. Your sweet words are so fascinating that they please even the greatest scholars, who also become attracted to You. We are also attracted by Your speaking and by the beauty of Your face and eyes. Please, therefore, satisfy us by Your nectarean kisses. Dear Lord, words spoken by You or words describing Your activities are full of nectar, and simply by speaking or hearing Your words one can be saved from the blazing fire of material existence. Great demigods like LordBrahmaand LordSivaare always engaged in chanting the glories of Your words. (devotees continue reading for several pages) Great yogis like LordSiva, LordBrahmaor even Lord Śeṣa and others always try to fix their attention uponKṛṣṇain their heart, but here thegopīsactually sawKṛṣṇaseated before them on their cloths.""",Prabhupāda," This isyoga. This isyogasystem, to seeKṛṣṇawithin your heart. That is real."
Devotee (2),(continues reading until end of chapter) (end),Prabhupāda," Māyā-sukhāya, for flickering happiness arranging huge paraphernalia, just like for sporting, restaurants(?), so many things.Māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43]. No use. There is no use, but sporting, for frivolous sporting as we saw yesterday. Beginning from the morning working, so many people are engaged, but they do not know the value of arrangingmaṅgala-ārati. They do not know. (laughter)Māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43]. Making huge arrangement. What for? Only flickering happiness, that's all.Vimūḍhā, rascals. Therefore,PrahlādaMaharajasays, ""I don't think for myself; I am simply anxious for these rascals who are engaged in huge affair for some flickering happiness.''Śoce tatovimukha-cetasa,māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43]. (chantsjapa) [break] Construct a very nice temple in this open park, people will come in the morning and they will see themaṅgala-ārati, takeprasādam. That would have been good for this life and the next life. And what are they doing?"
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"They're simply miserable, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," They're going to be cats and dogs and trees. They don't believe that there is life after death, so they think that ""Whatever we have got now, let us enjoy sense.'' And the university education is giving them facility, ""Yes, take education and gratify your senses from the age of twelve years.'' And at the last stage they think that ""I would have liked that one would have shot me down on my head.'' What that old lady was talking?"
Pañcadraviḍa(?); Devotee (2),"Oh, yes. (laughs); She said if someone else didn't shoot her, she would. She'd just do herself in.",Prabhupāda," Hopeless life.Māyā-sukhāya. Because they waste their time simply for flickering happiness, in future everything is zero.Śūnyavādī,nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi.Śūnyavādīmeans whose ultimate goal is zero.Pāścātya-deśa, Western countries.Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi. (chantsjapa) Every one of you should take this movement very seriously and save your country. Misguided.Andhāyathāndhair upanīyamānas[SB7.5.31]. (laughs) Blind men. This Nixon is a rascal number one, and he's the president. Just see. They have no other selection. All the people are rascals, and they must select one rascal to become their guider, another big rascal. (devotees chantjapa) [break] ...from Māyāpur?"
Devotee (Karāndhara?)(3),"Yes. The one you've written, from the old Book Trust?",Prabhupāda," No, no. They have sent one account."
Devotee (3),"Oh, yes, I reviewed that.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (3),I reviewed it. Yes.,Prabhupāda, Do you think it is all right?
Devotee (3),Appears to be in order.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (3),Everything appears to be in order.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. Anything irregular, you should immediately ask them to explain. At least there must be some check."
Devotee (3),I sentBhavānandaa letter yesterday explaining that would be the last of the cash; the rest would come in books.,Prabhupāda, Books you can take as much you like. There is (indistinct)?
Devotee (3),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Just like all the men, they are spending two thousand rupees for maintenance. They must work. And if they go with the books to any gentleman, they'll take.Māyā-sukhāyaudvahatovimūḍhān. [break] Americans are giving so much service, knowledge. Arrange everything. They are giving already; simply they should be distributed through us-powdered milk, grains. People will feel so much obliged, ""Oh, these American people are giving us knowledge and food.'' Practically they'll see how to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious—by ouraratika, by ourkīrtana, by our behavior, by our character. Not only in India—everywhere. This is real service to the human."
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"The government is spending millions of dollars to control the drug problem. In every city there are heroin addicts and all kinds of addicts, and they are very perplexed because there is no way to control.",Prabhupāda, This is the only way.
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"This is the only way, but they are not willing to listen. Recently I was in Washington talking to the officials. Our company is making a project for the government, $7,000,000 to investigate what is the best way. And every way it costs thousands of dollars for each person, and it's not even guaranteed. And they take them out of heroin and they are putting them on methadone or some other chemical drug, and that's their method. They are spending thousands and thousands of dollars and the person goes back to addiction after several years. No success. Our program costs nothing, and the politicians don't want to listen.",Prabhupāda," No. Their policy is that they want to keep the people in that way-rascals and fools—then they'll vote and they'll enjoy the political power. That is their policy. Actually they do not want to see their countrymen elevated good character. They don't want to see. If the people become... Just like the British government in their time, they wanted to give education. Their education means A-B-C-D-half, mediocre, so that the government may be run on. They require clerks, servants, so much, not high education. As soon as there was question of high education, they stopped. And actually it so happened that as soon as the Indian people became highly educated and they learned the history of the world, they kicked them out. So these people, these rascals, Nixon and company, they want to keep the people in ignorance so that they'll get vote and enjoy. If the people become intelligentbrāhmaṇas, then immediately he'll be kicked out. What is his value? He has no value. This is policy. They don't want to see that people become elevated in knowledge. That is not their policy. Therefore, they do not agree. Actually they are seeing that ""TheseHareKṛṣṇapeople, they're so nice character, they're religion, God conscious, so if all people become like this, then where we are?'' Because as soon as people becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, they'll noncooperate with the slaughterhouse, liquor industry, gambling, illicit sex. They will noncooperate. Then the whole plan of civilization will be collapsed."
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),Their biggest industry is the war industry.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"War, killing.",Prabhupāda," So, how they can (indistinct)? They do not know and do not actually want to see people enlightened. It is not their policy. It is simply make some show. Show means spend another set-up amount, investigation. Their men, the government men, they'll get money, that's all."
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),Jaya.,Prabhupāda, And finished. Engage some rascal report. This is going on.
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"Exactly, exactly.",Prabhupāda, Very dangerous.
Ātreya Ṛṣi(?),"They are all thieves, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Thieves, stealing from each other.",Prabhupāda," That's all. They don't want to see people very enlightened. ""It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss.'' But at least how to become wise, that injunction has been given to you. Now you try to save the country, how to do it. These people will not be. You'll have to educate the people, and they'll vote you to the senators, president, and then your country will be nice. Just like byKurukṣetra,Kṛṣṇasmashed all Duryodhana and company, and He postedYudhiṣṭhiraMahārāja. That is the Kṛṣṇa's politics. He wanted to smash all these demons and have His own men posted on the royal throne. WhenKalicould not penetrate into the daily behavior of the people, he planned killing ofParīkṣitMaharaja. So, oneKalibrāhmaṇacursed him to death, for no fault practically. Therefore thebrāhmaṇasof this age, they are condemned. The so-calledcastebrāhmaṇas, they're condemned. That is lamented by the father of the boy who cursedParīkṣitMaharaja. (japa) (end)"
Woman; Marilyn,"I just, er, um, I cook.; I play the dulcimer.",Prabhupāda, What's that?
Marilyn; Ātreya Ṛṣi(?); Marilyn,"Dulcimer?; Dulcimer.; It has strings, four strings, and it's shaped like that.",Prabhupāda," Oh, just like tambura."
Devotee,Tambura.,Prabhupāda, Like tambura.
Devotee,It's more like avina. [break],Prabhupāda, So you understand our philosophy?
John Fahey,"I don't know if I understand it, but I'm reading it.",Prabhupāda, Hm. What is your philosophy?
John Fahey,I don't know.,Prabhupāda, No philosophy of life? Why you are living?
John Fahey,I don't know. I was just born.,Prabhupāda," Born—everyone is born. Cats and dogs are also born. They also live, they also die. So if we live like that—""I was born. Let me live somewhere, and die''—then what is the difference?"
John Fahey,None.,Prabhupāda," No. There is difference. That one should understand. There is difference. A man should not live like cats and dogs, because he has got a mission."
John Fahey,Mission?,Prabhupāda," Mission. That mission is God realization. Cats and dogs cannot do it; human beings can do it. Therefore in any civilized human society, there is a type of religion. May be Christian religion or Mohammedan religion orHindureligion or Buddhist—there is religion. But you cannot find this religious system in the animal kingdom of life. That is the difference. If we give up this religious consciousness or God consciousness, then we are as good as cats and dogs. That is the only difference. You go anywhere, any part of the world, and civilized human beings, they have got a system, which you may call religion or philosophy, to understand God. That prerogative is especially for the human beings. But if you do not care for that special prerogative, then you are as good as animal. What is the difference between animal and human being unless he has got some method of understanding God? The animal eats and we also eat. The animals sleep; we also sleep. The animals have sexual intercourse; we have got also. They are also afraid of something; we are also afraid of something. Then what is the difference?"
John Fahey,They cannot understand God(?).,Prabhupāda," That is the difference. A human being can understand what is God, what is my relationship with God, what is my duty in that relationship, what is my aim of life, where I shall go after death, wherefrom I have come. These questions must be there in human form of life; otherwise we are still in the animal kingdom."
Marilyn,Do the animals have no consciousness of God?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Marilyn,Do the animals have no consciousness of God?,Prabhupāda, They have no God consciousness. They do not know what is God.
Marilyn,Somehow I always thought that...,Prabhupāda," Just like children, they do not know what is government. They are satisfied with their eating, sleeping, playing, that's all. They have no other concern. But when one is grown up, he knows what is government. He has to abide by the state laws. Now you are grown up, if you violate the law ""Keep to the right,'' you'll be criminal. But a child, if he violates the law, animal violates the law, he has no... But if a adult person violates the law, he'll be criminal. You cannot say, ""I'm free.'' No. Law will not excuse. But if a children commits something... Suppose you, if you take something from my table, it is for you criminal. But if a child takes something from my table, it is not criminal. In your country especially, if you enter my house or room without permission, that is criminal. Is it not? Trespass."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes.,Prabhupāda," But a child or dog enters, that is not trespassing. A child or dog or cat, they enter without any permission. Therefore this animal kingdom and the human being, there is difference. By the evolutionary process we come to the human form of life. When we were animals... We were animals also. We are passing through 8,400,000 forms of life—from aquatic to plants, trees, then insect, then flies, then birds, then beasts, then uncivilized human beings, jungle, then come to this Aryan form, civilized form of human being. So it is obtained after many, many transmigrations. And if we do not understand the responsibility... Just like in an establishment one man is promoted. His first charge is doorkeeper, then he is gradually he is given promotion; he may come to the post of the manager. Just like in bank, it so happens. They must go through all the different stages of service. So when he becomes manager, if he does not know the responsibility, again he comes to the lowest position. Again he has to strive for the top. So if we forget our responsibility and become like cats and dogs, then we are going back again to take the forms of cats and dogs. This is a great science. Nobody is very serious to understand this science, but the science is there. We are, ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is to educate people about this science. They're neglecting this science. That means they are violating the prerogative of the chance, the facility of human being. After all, you have to die; you cannot check it. But if you die like the cats and dogs, then our life is spoiled, and if you die like a human being, then our life is perfect. Everyone will die, but one who dies like a human being for understanding what is God, what is my relationship with Him, and acting in relationship with God, then our life is perfect. So you like this philosophy or not?"
Marilyn,"Somehow I always thought that people should be more like animals, because animals only, ah, only take what they need...",Prabhupāda, Why don't you become like animal?
Marilyn,Hm?,Prabhupāda," Why you are dressing yourself? Why don't you wander like animal, naked?"
Marilyn,"No. But animals still have their own communities, and they only take what they need to eat, and they only eat when they need to eat.",Prabhupāda, Now the philosophy is how to become animals? This is the philosophy nowadays?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Today's people sometimes, Prabhupāda, she's thinking, are worse than animal.",Prabhupāda," Yes. If their philosophy is to become animal then they must be worse than animal, because actually they are not animal."
Marilyn; Ātreya Ṛṣi,(laughs) That's what I mean.; That's right.,Prabhupāda," If the ultimate goal is to become animal, so that is artificial. So a human being desiring to become animal must be worse than animal, because animal has got some..."
Marilyn,Has got some...,Prabhupāda, ...routine work.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Because ah...,Prabhupāda," Just like cats and dogs. They have sexual desire in certain period of the year. But a man, although he is trying to be animal, but he has no restriction. He has sexual desire anytime. Therefore he is worse than animal."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Man eats and kills everything.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,The animals kill just their own quota.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So therefore, if a man wants to become animal, he becomes worse than animal. A tiger, a tiger eats meat and he has got equipments in his body, what is called, nails, teeth, immediately pounce upon any animal and kills and eats. But a man cannot do that, but his teeth is different, he has no nails; therefore he has to kill animal in different way, by slaughterhouse. So he is worse than animal. You kill one animal for your eating purpose, that is one thing, but if you keep slaughterhouse for business, then you are more (indistinct). Therefore for a human being to try to become animal is worse than the animals, because... Just like you are now grown up. If you imitate that ""I want to become child, so I enter anyone's house,'' the law will not allow you. And if you say that ""My philosophy is to become a child; therefore I enter this man's house,'' the law will say, ""All right, first of all you'll be punished.'' (laughter) You cannot say that. Because you are grown up you cannot act as a child. Similarly, because you are human being, if you act as an animal you'll be responsible for your acts. And you'll be punished if you do something wrong. You cannot say, ""No, I have made my philosophy to become a child.'' That may be your personal philosophy, but law will not allow you. Ignorance is no excuse. (long pause) It has become a philosophy now to become like animals."
Devotee (1),"They say ""Back to nature.""",Prabhupāda," ""Back to nature'' means first of all your nature is different from other's nature. An animal can lie down anywhere on the street. Can you do that? So how can man go back to nature like that? A dog lying down on the street... Here, of course, every dog has got a master. In India there are many dogs, they haven't got master, so they are eating anywhere or lying. But you cannot do so. If you lie down on the street at night, perhaps you'll be arrested. Is it not?"
Devotee (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Neither you can do so. You must have an apartment. Maybe less costly apartment, but because you are a human being you must have an apartment. So how you can go to the nature? Even theṛṣisused to live in the jungle, they had a cottage, not like animals. They had hermitage cottage to live. Just likeRūpaGoswāmī's picture. You have seen?"
Devotee (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," So they left their luxuriant residence as ministers. But when they went toVṛndāvana, they had a cottage."
Devotee (1); Ātreya Ṛṣi,"I think the impulse is more or less a reaction to their alienation for material life. They feel so alienated from artificial material life that they think maybe, that simply more..., they think animalistic would be more desirable.; The inclination may be right, but the spiritual education is lacking. They don't have the teacher.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,Education.,Prabhupāda, That is the defect of modern education.
John Fahey; Devotee; John Fahey; Devotee,"Well, they go to college, and so this is where the idea started. It got bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's out of control. (laughs) It's terrible. It's all-pervasive. (indistinct) I don't kill animals.; Vegetarian?; Now, yeah.; He's vegetarian.",Prabhupāda," Well vegetarians are not animals. (laughter) In India, you'll still you'll find ninety-percent of the population, they're vegetarians, strictly. Always vegetarians. They're quite healthy, they're working. Therefore vegetarians are human beings. Vegetables, that food is meant for human beings. That is natural. For a human being to become nonvegetarian is unnatural. And to become vegetarian, that is natural. Just like our teeth, it is meant for cutting vegetables, fruit, not meat. You will find cutting by these teeth, meat, it will be difficult. But you take any vegetable, any fruit, you can immediately cut. Our medical laws says that anything eatable which you cannot cut with the teeth and smash it properly, it will not be digested. So fruits and vegetables you can properly cut even raw, not to speak of cooked. Raw vegetables and raw fruits, you can cut with these teeth and smash it and you swallow, it will be nicely digested. You get all food value. But you cannot do in that way, raw meat. It is not possible. You cannot take raw meat or bite one animal and take some flesh out of it. You cannot. But animal can do that. They are made for that purpose. But that is natural. If you take your natural food, if you live naturally, if you fulfill your natural desires, then it is natural. And as soon as you go against these things, that is unnatural. So if you give up your natural tendency as human being and take artificially the way of life of an animal, that is not natural. In human society the..., however uncivilized human being, there is the process of covering this private part. Even in jungle they cover with the bark of tree. Why? That is the human being. But an animal in the jungle, they do not care. They can go, the same jungle—I don't speak of the city life—even in jungle life, the aborigines, still they have got some cover. Now they are becoming naked, natural life, nudism.Huh? That John Lennon, there is a picture in his sitting room, standing naked. This is madness. That is not natural life. If you go against your natural life, that is madness. Just like a madman walks on the street naked. So these are... So our mission is to advise everyone, educate everyone to become exactly like human being. That you can become by understanding God. The books, educational institutions, are meant for human being, for knowledge. All the books all over the world, they are not meant for cats and dogs. They are meant for human beings. The schools, colleges and universities, institutions, they are meant for human being, not for the cats and dogs. So we must take advantage of these books, institution, knowledge, teachers. That is real human life. Just like your guitar."
John Fahey,"Guitar, yes.",Prabhupāda," That is for human being, art, not for the cats and dogs. So how you can go to animal life? That is not possible. [break] How do you know your father?"
John Fahey,"Well, I met him.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
John Fahey,I met him. I grew up with him. (chuckles),Prabhupāda, How do you know your real father?
Devotee; John Fahey,"How do you know he's your father, who you met?; They just told me.",Prabhupāda, Who told you?
John Fahey,(laughs) My father.,Prabhupāda, Somebody told you.
John Fahey,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," The mother told you, or somebody told you."
John Fahey,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," And you accepted it. Similarly, about God you have to take information from somebody who is authorized to tell you about God."
John Fahey,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," Everything is known, can be known, from authorized source of knowledge. A child does not know what is this. He asks father, ""Father, what is this?'' The father explains, ""My dear boy, this is dictaphone. When I speak, it records.'' Childlike, you see? That is the way of knowledge. If you do not know God, you must approach a person who knows God. There is knowledge. There is no difficulty."
John Fahey,"But I went to church, and I still don't know.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,He went to church and he could not find out.,Prabhupāda, That may be.
John Fahey,I couldn't feel it.,Prabhupāda," That may be, but you may be cheated, that is another thing. Suppose you ask something from somebody. If he cheats you, that may be your mistake or his, but the process is the same; you cannot avoid it. If you want to know God, then you have to go to a person who knows God. You might have gone to a person who does not know. That is another thing. You went to a wrong person. But actually if you want to know God, you must have to go to a person who knows God. That you have to search out. That requires intelligence. But you cannot give up the idea. Because you have been cheated, ""I could not get information""; therefore, you cannot give up that business. You have to find out somebody else. But because you say ""I have been cheated. I could not get the right information. I stop this business,'' that is not allowed. You must. Therefore, according to Vedic order it is said,tadvijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].Abhigacchetmeans you must to a person to understand that science of God. You must go to aguruor a man who knows.Gurumeans who is more intelligent.Gurumeans weight, heavy, heavier, heavier in knowledge. So you have to find out a person who is heavier than you, not ordinary. Must go. Not that may go or may not go. No. Must go.Tadvijñānārthaṁsagurumevaabhigacchet[MU1.2.12]. And what is the symptom ofguru?Śrotriyaṁ. Means he has heard about God from his superior, hisguru.Śrotriyaṁ. And how can I know that he has heard from his superior about God? He might say that ""Yes, I have heard,'' but what symptoms?Brahma-niṣṭham.Brahma-niṣṭhammeans that he has become a complete devotee of God, result. Just like a man, physician. A physician means he has attended the medical college, passed the examination, and the result is that he's practicing as a physician. Not only passing will do, but he's actually passing and he's actually practicing and he's curing patients. Therefore, you find out a physician, here is a physician. It is not difficult. Sogurumeans one who knows God. How can I know that he knows God? Because he's making others to know God. Where is the difficulty? But if you go to a person who does not know God, that is your fault. If you go to a physician who is not actually physician, a storekeeper, then that is your fault. You must have the intelligence who is a physician. That much intelligence you have got. You see a signboard, Dr. such and such M.D., medical practicer. Now you go there and you see there are patients waiting for him, for his treatment, he's giving medicine and they are being cured. Then what is the difficulty to find out a physician? There is no difficulty. So if one is serious to be cured of the disease he must go to a physician. If he does not go to the physician, how he can be cured? Just like you have learned this guitar playing. Do you learn it alone or learn it from somebody?"
John Fahey,Mainly by myself.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
John Fahey,Mainly alone.,Prabhupāda," Anyway, you have followed somebody at least, standard."
John Fahey,"Oh, yeah, people I heard.",Prabhupāda," Yes. So that is the way of learning what is God. The main business is that one must know God. It is not that because I approach some person and he did not know, he could give me the right knowledge of God, then I give up this idea of knowing God. No. That will not..., that is not good for human life. Then you remain animal. I might have been cheated or I might not have approached the proper person, but that does not mean that I can stop that idea. That is not... In another place it is said,tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsuḥśreyauttamam[SB 11.3.21]. One who is actually inquisitive to understand the highest benefit of life, he must approach aguru.Tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsuḥ.Jijñāsumeans inquisitive.Śreya—the highest benefit of life.Uttamam-highest.Tasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsuḥśreyauttamam.Ṣābdeparecaniṣṇātaṁ. What is the qualification of such a person?Ṣābdeparecaniṣṇātaṁ. He is completely well versed in the transcendental science. And what is the symptom that he is well versed?Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. He has taken shelter ofBrahmaorKṛṣṇaor God.Upāsanā-finishing all desires. These two things: he is a devotee and he has no more material desires. He must be well versed in the science, he must be a devotee, and he has no attraction for material things. These three things, if you can find, then he's perfectguru. Everything is there in theśāstra; therefore books should be consulted. If you have no books, those who are discussing books, you should approach them, you should hear them. Just like we are holding class, morning, evening. People can come here, take advantage what we are speaking, then gradually they can understand. But we cannot avoid that. That is not good idea. If I say that ""I went to church. I'm not very much enlightened; therefore I give up this attempt,'' oh, that is not good."
John Fahey; Devotee,"Oh, I didn't give it up. I'm still looking.; He comes toaratik.",Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Devotee,He takesprasādam.,Prabhupāda," That's nice, very good. You also come?"
Marilyn,I just got here a little while ago.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Marilyn,"I just got here a few days ago, but I've been twice. We'll be here Friday or Saturday or so. I chanted on the street.",Prabhupāda, You chanted?
Marilyn; Devotee,HareKṛṣṇa.; Saṅkīrtanaparty.,Prabhupāda, Very good.
John Fahey; Marilyn,"We want get some cymbals, cymbals.; Cymbals. We sangHareKṛṣṇaon the airplane.",Prabhupāda, You're chantingHareKṛṣṇaon the airplane?
John Fahey,"Yeah, it was fun.",Prabhupāda," You can chant anywhere. There is no restriction. There is no special rules and regulations. You can chant anywhere. Whenever you find it convenient, you can chant."
John Fahey,"We were singingHareKṛṣṇa, so...",Prabhupāda," That's nice. Go on singing. (laughter) Yes. Go on singing and everything will be revealed within yourself, it's so nice."
