Yadubara,"It's a new magazine, and this is the second issue out in America. It promised to be a very good magazine, and it hasn't turned out to be so. It's just another slick magazine.",Prabhupāda," Well, unless magazines are reduced to such position, it will not be sold."
Yadubara,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, They want to make business... All these pictures are yours? No.
Yadubara,"No, just the ones on Kṛṣṇa consciousness...",Prabhupāda," Oh, thank you."
Yadubara,...I'm happy to say.,Prabhupāda, So who will go to Hong Kong?
Śyāmasundara; Devotee; Śyāmasundara,"Shall we decide now, or shall we wait until tomorrow?; I met one man from Hong Kong yesterday, Dr. Bali , and he said he'd give us financial help in Hong Kong. I will go to see him this morning. (indistinct); To Singapore also?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,"To Singapore also, the same men? The same two men will go to Singapore and Hong Kong. (devotees chant japa for several minutes) Do you think Revatīnandana could go? You said Revatīnandana should go?",Prabhupāda, He can go. ( japa continues) Are you getting some interest with our association?
Yadubara,"Yes, I am. I feel the effects of chanting very much.",Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Yadubara,It's very pleasant.,Prabhupāda," And if you have got any doubts, any questions, you can inquire. That is required."
Yadubara,I have been asking questions of devotees. It's hard for me to comprehend some of the things in the scriptures. I just don't understand.,Prabhupāda," No, apart from scripture, from your personal understanding you can place questions. People, generally, they have no idea of God. We are placing the factual God. That is very difficult to understand. Generally they think it is an idea, fiction. But we don't think like that. We have got clear conception of God. That is the difference between our Society and all any other religious groups. They have no clear idea of God. They simply say that there is God, God is great, but no clearer."
Yadubara,I think a lot of other societies make compromises.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yadubara,Many other societies make compromises. Many other religious groups make compromises in their doctrine.,Prabhupāda," Yes, because they have no clear idea. They cannot push forward their concept. Just like the other day (indistinct) lady, she asked if Kṛṣṇa was a naughty boy. Yes, because He is God He must be naughty boy. Otherwise, wherefrom this idea of naughty boy comes if that quality is not in God? God is the origin of everything, creator of everything. So if He hasn't got this naughtiness in His person, then how this thing comes to be? That is the Vedānta version, janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1 ] . The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which or from whom everything emanates. So wherefrom this naughtiness comes if it is not in the person of God? Wherefrom this stealing propensity comes if it is not in God? But because He is absolute, His stealing is also as good as his blessing. Mākhan - cora . Kṛṣṇa is stealing butter, that is worshiped, mākhana , by the very name. Just like in another temple, Kṣīra - cora - gopīnātha . Gopīnātha is known as condensed milk thief, Kṣīra - cora . He is famous by the name cora , thief. But that cora and this cora , you cannot compare. He is famous as cora , or thief, but thousands of people go every day to worship that cora , that thief. And in the material, if one is known as thief, then thousands of people will beat him with shoes. (laughter) That is the difference. If you say, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa was a thief, then I can become a thief,"" then your will be beating of shoes on your head, and Kṛṣṇa will be eternally worshiped because He is thief. That is the difference. That is Absolute. He will be worshiped as thief, and He will be worshiped as very honest. That is Absolute. (aside:) No, no, this (indistinct) is not good. I will take little fruit."
Śyāmasundara,It's salt and pepper.,Prabhupāda," No, no. One has to learn how Kṛṣṇa is always God in any circumstance. And if he can understand this philosophy, then Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad- gītā he becomes immediately liberated. Janma karma me divyaṁ ye jānāti tattvataḥ . ""My activities, My birth, they are all transcendental. One who understands in truth,"" tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. 4.9 ] , ""after leaving this body, he no more comes to this material."" That means we can be liberated simply by understanding His activities. All the qualities are described in the Nectar of Devotion. He has got sixty-four qualities. Unlimited qualities, but for our understanding, Rūpa Gosvāmī only discussed sixty-four. Just see, that lady was speaking that she speaks to thousands and thousands of people. How ignorant she is about God. She was inquiring, ""Kṛṣṇa is not..."" That means she cannot understand Kṛṣṇa . And she is leader, thousands of people she is speaking. What is the use of her speaking if she has no clear idea? This is going on. Useless speaking. In India also, so many fools, they are accepted as very perfect. Just like Gandhi , take Gandhi . Where was Gandhi ? In spiritual consciousness, he is nothing. Nothing, no value. But if we say in the public, they will be angry, ""Oh!"" But actually there is no value, no spiritual value. He is known all over the world as a great spiritualist. He was a moralist, that's all. That is not a qualification for understanding God."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : It says, ""Any activities sanctioned in the revealed scriptures and aiming at the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are accepted by saintly teachers as the regulative principles of devotional service. If somebody regularly executes such service unto the Personality of Godhead under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, then gradually he rises to the platform of serving in pure love of God.""",Prabhupāda, That nonviolence. Kṛṣṇa is number one violent. (chuckles) Number one. There is no limit of His violence. Just see.
Yadubara,"Don't you have... In the material world, sometimes you have to stand up for what you think is right and sometimes use violence?",Prabhupāda," Only satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is right. All wrong. If Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, that is right. Otherwise everything wrong."
Yadubara,A man in Surat brought up the question of the British in India.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yadubara,"A man in Surat brought up the question of the British in India, and he felt they should be thrown out.",Prabhupāda, Surat?
Devotee,In Surat.,Prabhupāda," Surat, what happened? One man questioned?"
Devotee,A man in Surat brought up the question of whether the British should be removed from India.,Prabhupāda, British? I do not understand. What is his real question?
Śyāmasundara; Yadubara,"Should the British have been violently thrown out of India?; But if somebody is stepping on you, then you should take action to remove those people.",Prabhupāda," Yes, our position is how to satisfy Kṛṣṇa , not for personal self. Ordinary world activities. Serving Kṛṣṇa and the result of such service is the same. In the material world, doing something and result of the doing is different. Our means and end is the same. Just like Kṛṣṇa advises Yudhiṣṭhira to speak lie to Droṇācārya. It is a means. The means is also Kṛṣṇa , and the end is also Kṛṣṇa . That is Absolute. Absolute... We must have clear conception of what is the Absolute. In any circumstances, the quality of the Absolute remains the same. What was the question in Surat?"
Devotee,Whether the British should have been forcibly removed from India.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is ordinary duty. If you encroach upon my freedom, I have the right to kill you. That is recommended. That is clearly stated in the śāstras. If anyone sets fire in another's house, if anyone kidnaps his wife, if anyone takes his money—so many list—he is to be killed. There is no question. He can be killed immediately. That action-reaction is going on in the material world, that is a different thing. That is karma - bandha . But in devotion, there is no karma - bandha . As Kṛṣṇa is free from all reaction, similarly Kṛṣṇa's devotee who wants to satisfy Kṛṣṇa only, he is also free from all reaction. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāva - manyeta karhicit [SB 11.17.27] . ""The ācārya is as good as I am,"" Kṛṣṇa says. Nāva - manyeta karhicit , ""Never neglect him."" Na martya -buddhyāsūyeta, ""Never be envious of the ācārya , thinking him as anything of this material world."" Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān [SB 11.17.27]. Therefore, ācārya's position is as good as Kṛṣṇa . Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta -śāstrair ** . Ācārya is always cautious that he may not be subject to criticism. But who criticizes ācārya , he becomes immediately offender. Because he is playing the part of ācārya , he plays as far as possible. But sometimes for preaching work, he might have to do something which is not consistent. But if he is criticized, then that man who criticizes, he becomes... Of course, he must be ācārya , not a bogus. Ordinary man cannot transgress the laws, but Kṛṣṇa and His representative, ācārya , might be sometimes seen that he has transgressed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān [SB 11.17.27] . Vaiṣṇavera kriyā , mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya . In the Caitanya - caritāmṛta , Vaiṣṇava ācārya , his activities is not understood even by the wisest man. Vaiṣṇavera kriyā , mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya . Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. Ācārya, guru , he is completely surrendered to Kṛṣṇa . He has taken the shelter of Kṛṣṇa , being completely freed from all material affection. Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. Everything... Everyone has got some material desire to fulfill, but a guru or ācārya has no such business. That is the symptom of ācārya . He has no more any material business. Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. He has finished all business of material satisfaction. That is the symptom of ācārya . And śābde pare ca niṣṇātam . And he has taken full bath in the ocean of transcendental (indistinct). Śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta [SB 11.3.21] , one should surrender to such spiritual master. Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam , when he is actually serious about inquiring the transcendental subject matter. Otherwise there is no need of accepting guru or ācārya . He has no business. If one is not interested in the transcendental subject matter... Just like so many people come, they have no interest. Unnecessarily they talk and waste time. As soon as I asked that man that ""If I say something, whether you will accept?"" He said, ""If I like it, then I shall accept."" Then why come to waste my time to inquire from me? Therefore Bhagavad- gītā says, tad viddhi praṇipātena [Bg. 4.34 ] . When you go to inquire something from a person, you must fully surrender there, or you must find out a person where you can fully surrender. Otherwise, don't put any questions. Your waste of time, his waste of time. Because he will not accept. Suppose if you go to a physician, you are diseased, and the physician says, ""All right, I shall give you medicine."" And if you say, ""Yes, I shall accept the medicine if I like it,"" then why do you go to that physician? What is the meaning? The physician, one physician doctor friend, long...,  forty years ago, he prescribed one of my patent medicines. And the patient little protested because it is Indian-made. He was Eurasian. So as soon as he questioned, ""What is this medicine, Indian-made?"" ""Yes, it is Indian-made. If you have no such faith, don't come to me."" He flatly said, ""Don't come to me."" That should be the position of the physician or ācārya . If you go there, you should accept whatever he says. If you are in doubt, then don't go there. That is the position. It is freedom. It is not that you have to accept some ācārya particular by canvassing. No, you should be inspired that ""Yes, here I can surrender, here I can gain something."" Then surrender. In the spiritual science, there is no bluffing. Everything must be very clear-cut. Otherwise it will be not very satisfactory. [break] Hear this sound, ca -caw caw. (laughter) Because nobody takes this rooster."
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Oh, that's chicken? Oh.",Prabhupāda," No, what is..."
Yamunā,Yamunā : Peacock?,Prabhupāda," Peacock, yes. Yak, yak, like that. That sound he makes."
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : And kīrtana .,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : We can hear kīrtana .,Prabhupāda," Kīrtana and bell in the temple, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong. This sound we will hear early in... (sound of rooster crowing in background)"
Devotee,There's not so much at Advaita Bhavan .,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,There's not chickens at Advaita Bhavan .,Prabhupāda," No, in neighborhood. In Hawaii, they are very much fond of. Some of them eat dogs also."
Devotee,"Yes, the Filipinos eat dogs.",Prabhupāda, Filipino.
Yadubara,Chinese also sometimes.,Prabhupāda, Dog-eaters.
Yadubara,Sometimes monkeys also.,Prabhupāda, Monkey?
Yadubara,"Um hm. Monkey brain. It's very rare, but it's done.",Prabhupāda, Chinese?
Yadubara,Chinese.,Prabhupāda," Chinese, they eat everything. (laughter) They eat rats also. Rats, snakes. They are caṇḍālas ."
Yadubara,They say Chinese are very practical and that they will make use of anything.,Prabhupāda," They eat man also. Yes. There was a case in Calcutta, they were eating man. They will call a hawker, ""Come in, I shall purchase."" And as soon as he enters, he never comes back. There were two hawkers. So one entered the house and other was waiting. But when he saw that he is not coming, he went to the police, that ""My friend, he went but he is not coming."" The police inquired and made a search, whole house, there were so many human bones, they're eating. Man-eater. Man-eater, in Africa there are many."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They're called cannibals.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They're called cannibals.,Prabhupāda, That is also. And they eat white man very... They like white.
Yadubara,In the pot.,Prabhupāda," They will mislead some white man and... In India also there is this class. In Assam side. They eat man. Man means they regularly sacrifice before the Goddess Durgā and eat. (indistinct), Rāvaṇa's brother. The Red Indians, they also eat in America. Do they not?"
Yamunā,Yamunā : They used to. There are no left anymore.,Prabhupāda," ""Used to"" means who knows what they are doing now."
Yamunā,Yamunā : The white men came and killed them.,Prabhupāda," That is another thing, but they kill for eating. That is..., fighting or for taking possession, killing, that is everywhere. that is not extraordinary. But killing for eating a man, that is extraordinary. (chuckles)"
Devotee,"That's only in Kali - yuga , yes, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,Only in...,Prabhupāda," No, no, all the yugas . More or less. (aside:) So when we shall have to go?"
Devotee,I'll just see if the car is here. [break],Prabhupāda," ...take away Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma . The Japanese, they also eat everything? No."
Devotee,Not now.,Prabhupāda, Some of them?
Devotee,"In times of war, I think all people...",Prabhupāda," That is another thing, but generally."
Devotee,"No, they don't. In China, the island of Taiwan, the original inhabitants, they were known as man-eaters.",Prabhupāda, Man-eaters?
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So this Calcutta story is not a story, it is fact. Hm?"
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : I was asking Yamunā about the tape.,Prabhupāda, Tape?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : About this tape recording.,Prabhupāda," Yes. It is not the question of ""the Chinese are eating, I am not eating."" It is a question that how many number of different types of body I got. It is not that I am talking of Chinaman eating man or dog. I may be in this form, next life. So, therefore, the problem is how to stop this transmigration of the soul. That is the problem. Not that because the Chinese man eats something else other than I eat, that does not mean that I am very much... [break] Therefore, we have to prepare ourself what kind of body we are going to have next. That is human civilization. But they do not believe in the transmigration of the soul. They do not believe in God. They do not believe in anything. Simply just like animals. This life—eating, sleeping, mating—do it to your best capacity. That is Kali - yuga . They have no knowledge, neither they are interested to know. Mandāḥ . And even they become little interested of spiritual..., a hodgepodge, no clear idea. Mandāḥ sumanda matayo [SB 1.1.10 ] . And unfortunate, harassed in every field of life. And hy upadrutāḥ . And over and above everything, they are always disturbed by external enemies. This is the position of Kali - yuga . And this life shortened, duration of life. So how they can advance by following the regular Vedic process? It is not possible. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma [Ādi 17.21 ] . No car?"
Śyāmasundara,Not yet come.,Prabhupāda, When?
Śyāmasundara,He will ring as soon as it comes. He telephoned it is on its way. It should be here any moment.,Prabhupāda," They are so slow. They do not understand the spiritual value of life, and simply they are satisfied with something hodgepodge, that's all. The entire population of the present-day world. Just like the hippies. There are so many hippies. They want something spiritual, but no clear... Something hodgepodge, that's all."
Yadubara,"Has this happened before, the material wealth that we have now? Has it happened in past ages?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yadubara,"Technological advancement, scientific?",Prabhupāda," All scientific. As this is winter season, so there will be a summer season. Anyone can say that after two months there will be summer season. Similarly, these ages are also, what is called, changing. So now it is Kali - yuga . After this Kali - yuga , there will be Satya - yuga . Cycle. So everything is happening. When there is winter season, everyone feels cold. So there is no question of asking. The particular type of age and its reaction of the quality of the nature, it will be there. So as there are many Kali -yugas, so it is to be understood that many times these things happened, and many times again will happen. Seasonal flowers, fruits. In the past, there were many times all those flowers and fruits, and in the future also they will appear. What is the difficulty to understand? But if in all these changing circumstances, if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then your position becomes transcendental. You are no more subjected to all this changing process. So that opportunity is in the human life. It doesn't matter whether he is in the Kali - yuga or Satya - yuga . Because he has got this human form of life, he must be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then his problem is solved. So you have to preach like this, that we are giving the best human welfare activities to utilize this human form of life."
Yadubara; Yadubara,They get very upset.; They get very upset.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yadubara,They have no conception of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They just don't understand.,Prabhupāda," Only intelligent person can understand. If you can understand, then you are intelligent. Are you understanding or not?"
Yadubara,No. (laughter),Prabhupāda, Then why you are not understanding yet? We have given free scope. What is your reason of not understanding?
Yadubara,"I think I understand a little bit, gradually.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. Even if you understand little bit, that will give you great benefit. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato. If you understand little, that means your door is open. Just like sometimes there is boil. If little mouth is open, that means that is the beginning of oozing out all the pus. It will gradually open, and that is the natural venue. Open and it will be cured. So little understanding is also very good. Then you will understand further. What you have understood now?"
Yadubara,"What have I understood? I understand that the chant has potency, has some meaning for me. And I understand on the basis of what I've done before, on the basis of my experience, what I've seen around me, I've seen that conditions are not good. And I've seen the conditions in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are much better and the feeling is much better.",Prabhupāda, That is very good sign. Yes.
Yadubara,So I think it must have some worth. There must be something here.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You can discuss with these boys and girls. Try to understand. Here there is nothing dogmatic. Even something appears to be dogmatic, it is not dogmatic."
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Even if we have dog's obstinacy, Prabhupāda...",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Even if we have dog's obstinacy, if we just associate long enough, then it will act upon you.",Prabhupāda," Yes, if we open our heart, then open-heartedly, then it will be nice. No reservation. And that open-heartedness means free from designation. That is open-heartedness. If I think, ""Oh, I am American. Why shall I take this Indian philosophy?"" Or if I think, ""I am Christian. Why shall I take the philosophy of Bhagavad- gītā ?"" then it will not work. One has to be free from these designations. Then it will be easy. I am... God is God, and I am also part and parcel of God, my relationship with God. So let me understand what is that relationship, what is God, what I am. That freedom, that open-heartedness will make it. But if I try to understand as Christian, as Englishman, as Japanese, as Indian, then it will be difficult. Many of our students joined, even initiated, but they could not make them free from these stereotyped ideas. Sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ tat - paratvena nirmalam [Cc. Madhya 19.170 ] . One must be free from the... Aiye aiye. So let us go. Take the box. [break]"
Devotee,"I'll try and please you, but I don't think I can do such a nice job.",Prabhupāda," I have seen the Sai's photo . From his photograph, it appears he has a guru . From his appearance, I can understand."
Devotee,I feel that it is my duty to see that the devotees who are staying at the other temples are respectful and are following your wishes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,"Some things that Sai mentioned in that letter that I should answer, he asked about photographs, spiritual photographs.",Prabhupāda, My photograph?
Devotee,"Yes, he said something about photographs, that the devotees had photographs of him and he didn't want them to have them if you didn't want them to.",Prabhupāda," Oh, that is not harmful. (break—end)"
Kṣīrodakaśāyī,Quarter to eleven I give the time to start from here to reach...,Prabhupāda, What is the time now?
Kṣīrodakaśāyī; Devotee; Kṣīrodakaśāyī,Twenty past...; Ten fifteen.; Quarter past ten.,Prabhupāda, So you want the check immediately?
Kṣīrodakaśāyī,"We have to buy the stamp, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," No, the check will not buy stamp; you have to take money."
Kṣīrodakaśāyī; Devotee; Śyāmasundara,"Yes, I will give the check to the man and then he will give me cash to..., before we go to Mathurā .; Actually he planned them very nicely.; Is he willing to give us the rooms?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yamunā; Śyāmasundara; Devotee; Yamunā,"Yamunā : Oh, Prabhupāda.; We should take them, I think.; I don't (indistinct).; Yamunā : We must take them, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," To ride on a car in Vṛndāvana .

Indian man,Minimum is five hundred rupees.,Prabhupāda, Why five hundred? Sixty...
Indian man,"Sixty-five rupees per thousand for the stamp duty, then court fees, and then other (indistinct) solicitor charges or the (indistinct) charges. So the last time... [break]",Prabhupāda, Yes. So...
Indian man,"Would you like to see the draft, Prabhupāda, first?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Indian man,"If you like it, then I can send that draft?",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is... I want..."
Indian man,You want to see the draft first?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because if there is little to be changed, then..."
Indian man; Gurudāsa,But that is a rough draft I read last night.; Guru dāsa : But we should include that section that says that the front part cannot be used for any commercial...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : That should be included.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is (indistinct) [break] Thousand rupees?
Indian man,"No, eight hundred. Put it eight hundred.",Prabhupāda," Write eight hundred and sign, I will sign. [break]"
Indian man (2),"A place for you, for a park, nice place for the ashram, on the parikrama path.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (2),Away from the town hustle and bustle and...,Prabhupāda, What is their demand?
Indian man (2); Gurudāsa,Which one? I showed him... I showed two places. Which one?; Guru dāsa : The very large one right next to the road. The road curves like this. It is still part of that property.,Prabhupāda, You have not given that? Then change little. Not change—we have got addition that that portion cannot be used...
Indian man; Śyāmasundara; Indian man (2); Śyāmasundara; Indian man (2); Gurudāsa; Indian man (2); Gurudāsa; Indian man (2),"Yes, I do the draft work before I put it (indistinct).; The name of that place was Parasurama .; Parasurama ?; Yeah.; I don't remember now, I made the inquiries just then and I have forgotten. And I told Suba(?) dāsa Bābājī the exact amount that they wanted and so on. I think it was... I don't quite remember, it was sixty thousand or what. For the smaller one it was perhaps forty thousand.; Guru dāsa : And the bigger one was sixty thousand.; Bigger one was perhaps sixty thousand. I don't quite remember now. We didn't talk with the owner, you see, but the people residing there, they gave an idea. We didn't proceed further because Suba(?) dāsa Bābājī said unless Prabhupāda approves it, he would not seek further. So hopefully that price that they demand, they will come to talk and we talk with the owners themselves.; Guru dāsa : Yes, but they're eager to sell that property, the owners? Where are the owners? Do you know?; None of the owners are here, but I'm told one Mr. Lodiya(?)... [break]",Prabhupāda, ... Vṛndāvana - dhāma .
Indian man (2),"Situated (indistinct). (laughs) There is something going on always, you know. (laughs) Just now there is a controversy going on. One Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa Bābā has published a book, have you read that?",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is from Rādhā - kuṇḍa ?
Indian man (2),"No, Prabhupāda, (indistinct). He has brought out a book which is (indistinct).",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Indian man (2),"He says that this Pañca - tattva principle, we should recognize that this we have borrowed from Buddhism. And there is no mention of Pañca - tattva before Caitanya - caritāmṛta .",Prabhupāda, That means he defies Caitanya - caritāmṛta .
Indian man (2),"He defies Caitanya - caritāmṛta , he defies Caitanya - caritāmṛta like anything, right and left, right and left.",Prabhupāda, He is a demon.
Indian man (2),Huh ?,Prabhupāda, Then he is a demon.
Indian man (2),"But, you see, the trouble is he is well read, and he has tried to make a very good unchallengeable sort of a case, and I tell you that nobody from Vṛndāvana has yet been able to come out with a cogent reply. We have yet to find out an answer to two important question that he has raised: one, as to whether this principle of Pañca - tattva has been mentioned anywhere in the works of the Gosvāmīs prior to Caitanya - caritāmṛta ; and two, this (indistinct), whether this has also been mentioned anywhere before. Both these he says have been borrowed by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. They have been introduced under the influence of Buddhism, prevalent so much.",Prabhupāda, How he gives quotation from Buddhism?
Indian man (2),"No, he...",Prabhupāda, But he says from Buddhism.
Indian man (2),"He draws comparisons. He traces the historical background, and then the conditions prevalent..., conditions prevalent particularly in Orissa at that time Vyāsarūpa(?) Gosvāmī lived.",Prabhupāda, One thing is that he says that it is from Buddhism. So where is the authoritative statement in the Buddhism about Pañca - tattva ? That he has not mentioned.
Indian man (2),No. He has said in Buddhism you have the principle of pañca -śaktis.,Prabhupāda, Śakti and tattva is not the same thing.
Indian man (2),"Well, yes.",Prabhupāda, Śakti is part of tattva .
Indian man (2),But these Pañca -tattvas...,Prabhupāda, Śakti also can be taken as tattva .
Indian man (2),"As tattva , yes. And these tattvas, Pañca -tattvas, have been described as śaktis. These Pañca -tattvas also have been described as śakti .",Prabhupāda," But Caitanya Mahaprabhu as śaktimān , and others..."
Indian man (2),As śakti .,Prabhupāda," Not all śakti ; two Pañca - tattva . Īśāvatāra, tat - prakāśa (?) avatāra , they are not śakti . They are all the śaktimān ."
Indian man (2),"Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda," And only śakti - tattva , Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa. And other three, they are śaktimān - tattva ."
Indian man (2),They are śaktimān - tattva .,Prabhupāda, Pañca -tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ bhakta ...
Indian man (2),"That śloka is from Svarūpa Dāmodara , his kavaca, which he says nobody has ever seen. So it was very safe for Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja to quote the authority of this kavaca because it is nonexistent. And that is his only authority for the Pañca - tattva principle. A mention has also been made of this in Gaura -gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, but he says that is not an authoritative work, that that doesn't really...",Prabhupāda," That means whatever he says, that is authority."
Indian man (2),"No, but you see, he argues it out.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Indian man (2),He argues it out.,Prabhupāda," Argue, that's all right. But this..."
Indian man (2),"The trend is that, whatever he says.",Prabhupāda, Gaura -gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā all the ācāryas have accepted.
Indian man (2),"But there is a trend now not to accept it. You see, Rādhā -Govindanātha does not accept it. Rādhā -Govindanātha in his big work, he has..., he has not...",Prabhupāda," This Rādhā -Govindanātha, there was some protest against him. He has not accepted Baladeva Vidyābhūṣana also as authority."
Indian man (2),"He has not accepted. This point also he has raised, this man.",Prabhupāda," So this difference of opinion may be there, but he is also one of the..., what is called? Differentiate? This gentleman who has..."
Indian man (2),Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa .,Prabhupāda," So differences are there, there will be always. So how one's opinion should be taken as..."
Indian man (2),"Yes. No, but you see, this kind of writing does create sort of a... It does give rise to...",Prabhupāda, So Vṛndāvana is the breeding ground for such things.
Indian man (2),"No, it's not Vṛndāvana . That man doesn't live here, he lives in Calcutta. The book was brought here. It was sent by him to some people, and one copy was directed to me also. Five copies were sent here, and I have the honor to be the recipient of one of them. (laughs)",Prabhupāda, How big it is?
Indian man (2),"A small thing, small thing, about eighty, ninety pages. So I was just going through it, I have been, and I will call a gentleman at two o'clock today with whom I shall discuss the matter. He belongs to that party.",Prabhupāda, Which party?
Indian man (2),The author.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Indian man (2),"The author, author's party.",Prabhupāda, Author's party. They have got a party here?
Indian man (2),"No party here, but this gentleman has given the foreword. He is the author of Ṭhākura Haridāsa , that big volume.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Indian man (2),"Rama -(indistinct) dāsa . A foreword in his name has appeared in this book, which he says he never gave. He never gave that foreword, but his name was given. And he has also published this in paper, and the author of that book has not challenged it so far. So his hands seem to be...",Prabhupāda," What he is, the author?"
Indian man (2),Kṛṣṇa Caitanya dāsa .,Prabhupāda," No, what he is, is he professor or what?"
Indian man (2); Gurudāsa; Indian man (2); Gurudāsa; Indian man (2); Gurudāsa; Indian man (2),"No, he's not a professor. He's just a sadak (?), you see, interested in reading and writing.; Guru dāsa : So if he will put the name on any foreword, then he can also create any theory. If that man did not give the foreword and he has put the name, he will create any theory.; Yes, of course, that's what he is up to, that's what he is up to.; Guru dāsa : And if someone doubts that, then they're not strong followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu .; Yes. That is a great thing against him.; Guru dāsa : How can you doubt the authority?; I think he has got certain preconceptions in his mind and, you see, he just tries to prove them by collecting all sorts of data that will just fit into his point of view.",Prabhupāda, Just like Gandhi wanted to prove nonviolence from Gītā .
Indian man (2); Devotee,"From Gītā . No, not like that. I would say like Brindarkara(?) wanted to prove that the..., that Kṛṣṇa story and Kṛṣṇa religion had been borrowed from West, you see, and they are a copy of Christ religion. Mandakara has done that.(end); On the calendar here it has 14th of September Advent of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, the 13th September, worship of Śrī Vāmanadeva. Fifteenth of September Viśvarūpa festival.",Prabhupāda," Yes, 15th September, Viśvarūpa ."
Devotee,"Fourteenth of September,",Prabhupāda," No, 15th September."
Devotee,"Yeah, Visvarupa , but 14th of September advent of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda.",Prabhupāda," No, that should be 13th."
Devotee,Thirteenth.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura 13th, and 14th Ananta Caturdaśī and Haridāsa Ṭhākura. So, this 14th September should be observed fasting, whole day."
Devotee; Devotee,"Fourteenth is the advent of or the demise of Haridāsa Ṭhākura?; The death, I mean the disappearance",Prabhupāda," Yes, but not for demise of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, but because that is Ananta Caturdaśī Vrata , the, generally the fasting is observed till evening, up to 5 o'clock. The next day, Viśvarūpa Mahotsava , feasting."
Devotee,"On the 13th of September, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda's Appearance is there any special observance?",Prabhupāda," No, special observance means to discuss about the life and works of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, thats all. Then 26th September, Ekādaśī . Then 10th October, Vijayā - daśamī , appearance date of Śrīla Madhvācārya, and the victory day of Lord Rāmacandra . So there is no fasting, but in the evening we should celebrate some feasting and discuss about the life and works of Śrī Madhvācārya as well as Rāmāyaṇa incidents where Rāma and Rāvaṇa fought."
Devotee,Thank you Prabhupāda. (end),Prabhupāda," There is a book, perhaps you might have read, Aquarian Gospel. So in that book I have read there is a Greek word, Christo. Christo ... Sometimes we don't say Kṛṣṇa , we say Kṛṣṭa ."
Dr. Kapoor,"Kṛṣṭa , yes, in Bengali particularly.",Prabhupāda," Yes. So this Christo word means ""anointed."" Kṛṣṇa's face is anointed. And love also. And this Christ title was given to Jesus on account of his love for God. So on the whole, the conclusion is Kṛṣṇa or Christo means ""love of Godhead."""
Dr. Kapoor; Yamunā; Dr. Kapoor; Yamunā; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Yamunā; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,"No, Mandakara(?) has tried to argue that the entire Kṛṣṇa religion of Śrīmad- Bhāgavata has been borrowed from the West.; Yamunā : How is this possible?; Eh?; Yamunā : How does he do that chronologically? How is that possible? It's impossible to do that.; There was some exchange, some people came from Greece here, and just...; Guru dāsa : But the Greek civilization was not developed five thousand years ago.; Yamunā : It wasn't even developed.; But he doesn't take it so back as five thousand years.; Guru dāsa : So anybody can say anything. (guest laughs)",Prabhupāda," Our authorities, they accept Mandakara(?) is not as good as Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Śaṅkarācārya. We... Nobody can give credit to Mandakara more than these ācāryas or Caitanya . So how his proposition can be accepted?"
Dr. Kapoor,"So he was knighted, you see, by the British government.",Prabhupāda," Yes, just see. (guest laughs) Just like Nehru bribed one Mukerjee, Rādhā - kuṇḍa Mukerjee, doctor, to write book where he has supported cow slaughter."
Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,"He supported. Hmm, hmm.; Guru dāsa : If I was the Western government and you handed the most perfect knowledge to me, I would knight you also, in the name of myself. Certainly I would knight you.",Prabhupāda," So Rādhā - kuṇḍa Mukerjee, he has supported cow slaughter. He was given a post, made a parliament member first of all. So this poor man, five hundred rupees per month, he accepted. Then he induced that ""You take more money, write like this."" So if you pay money... British government's whole policy was that if the Indians are kept strict Hindus, it is next to impossible to govern them. So therefore they adopted this policy. They changed the whole policy how the Hindu will think everything mentioned in the śāstra is nonsense. They have trained up, and Nehru is the first-class trainee. Everything mentioned in the śāstra , the Arya -samaj, they also wrote Saptartha (indistinct), so many. And Dr. Radhakrishnan also. All the scholars, they would never mention any śāstra more than once within one thousand years. That means..."
Dr. Kapoor,Otherwise they would not be scholars.,Prabhupāda, No. Otherwise they will not be scholars.
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : At any rate, where it came from is...",Prabhupāda," Because according to Darwin's theory, your forefather was monkey. So their theory is that long before there were monkeys only. How such high philosophical thoughts could come?"
Dr. Kapoor,It is true that in England there were only monkeys there. (laughter),Prabhupāda," On this theory, all their philosophy is going on. So if they give credit that Indians were so high scholars and philosophers, then the whole theory is spoiled. Because brain is developing, and the background of brain was monkey. So how such philosophical highly moral scholarly work can be done? And this is going on. If Bhāgavata is accepted as we accept that five thousand years ago it was written, then their whole civilization becomes topsy-turvy."
Dr. Kapoor,About the Bhāgavata also he says that there is the mention of Buddha in Bhāgavata and many descendants of Buddha who lived...,Prabhupāda," The Buddhists, they don't accept that verse. Kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati , buddho nāmnāñjana- sutaḥ . They do not accept. About Buddha , in Hindu literature, Vedic literature, there is mention, bhaviśyati , feature(?). That is insult to them. Therefore, they do not accept this verse. Neither we say Buddha is incarnation of God. Keśava dhṛta - buddha - śarīra . They do not accept this. They think it is insult."
Dr. Kapoor,Insulting them.,Prabhupāda," Yes, Hindu gods... But in one Buddha temple, I have seen in Penang, there is Viṣṇu - mūrti . Yes, four hundred years old. That is a Buddhist temple."
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Dr. Chandra has found many.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Dr. Chandra has found many Viṣṇu - mūrtis in Buddhist temples.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yamunā,Yamunā : Especially in Malaysia.,Prabhupāda, Malaysia.
Yamunā,"Yamunā : Especially in Malaysia, so many.",Prabhupāda," Malaysia, I speak of Malaysia, Penang is in Malaysia. Dr. Chandra (indistinct)."
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," So they worship Viṣṇu . And Buddha ... Buddha - dharma is an offshoot of the Vedic religion. That is the proof, they worship Viṣṇu . Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā ."
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : But to this man, he says that's the proof that Vaiṣṇava is an offshoot of Buddhism, that Viṣṇu is in the Buddhist temple. He can say that.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : This Caitanya who has written this book can say that since Viṣṇu is in the Buddhist temple that this proves that Viṣṇu is an offshoot of Buddhism.,Prabhupāda," Yes, he can say like that. But the offshoot he cannot say. Viṣṇu is long, long ago mentioned, Buddha is later. Buddha can be from Viṣṇu , but Viṣṇu cannot be from Buddha ."
Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Śyāmasundara; Dr. Kapoor; Śyāmasundara; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : So how do they speak of that chronologically? They don't accept that Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam as five thousand years old?; No. [break] This bundle...; No, those are documents.; Documents?; Yeah, photocopies.; You promised to give me a photo of Prabhupāda.; Guru dāsa : I'll give you one.",Prabhupāda," If you have got any colored photo , you can give him. So we have now increased eighty-seven."
Śyāmasundara,"More, ninety-two.",Prabhupāda, Ninety-two?
Dr. Kapoor,"Ah, you don't know yourself. (laughs)",Prabhupāda," Yes, actually Kapoorji, I do not know how things are going like this. I tell you frankly. I have no credit. But things are going on like this. It is something like—of course, I am not comparing exactly—just like Kṛṣṇa could not understand about His potency and, therefore He became Rādhārāṇī's feature to understand Himself. So... Of course, I... This is a comparison. Things are taking very wonderfully. Very wonderfully. Just see these boys and girls, how seriously they have taken."
Dr. Kapoor,"Oh, yes, there is no doubt about their earnestness, and people have...This is just what strikes people. How can these people be so sincere and so earnest?",Prabhupāda, So I simply...
Dr. Kapoor,They are beating Indians. (laughs),Prabhupāda," I simply advise them that you regularly chant the sixteen rounds. Not more, you cannot make... You cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. But there must be one saṅkhyā . Saṅkhyā -pūrvaka- nāma - gāna . They are observing that and the regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. And they are following other instructions, so they are wonderfully."
Dr. Kapoor,"You know Dalmiaji's daughter-in-law, the wife of Viṣṇu Hari Dalmia...",Prabhupāda," Viṣṇu Hari went to see me in London, perhaps with his wife."
Dr. Kapoor,"Accha . She told me, she said the movement is all right but they are so strict, such strict rules and regulations are being imposed upon these people, how long will they be able to follow them?",Prabhupāda, That is a surprise.
Dr. Kapoor; Yamunā,"This is bound to fail, she said. I say it will succeed just because of this. (laughter) The rules and regulations imposed upon them are like strong fences put around them to keep māyā away, you see?; Yamunā : They want relgiosity watered down.",Prabhupāda," Actually, because they are following strictly, māyā cannot touch them. Yaḥ śāstra - vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma - kārataḥ , na sa siddhim [ Bg . 16.23 ]. Kṛṣṇa says vidhi . Bhakti - vidhi . Must be followed. (aside:) This is cut piece? Cut piece from the book cover? No. It is original photo ?"
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : A copy.,Prabhupāda, Copy.
Dr. Kapoor,It is fine. [break] (laughs) But now I changed so there is a Radha - Kṛṣṇa photo in the background which is cut.,Prabhupāda, You can give some of that. It is not very nice.
Yamunā; Gurudāsa; Yamunā,"Yamunā : We need the nice ones.; Guru dāsa : We don't have any others.; Yamunā : We didn't bring so many things with us, but we'll give him very nice.",Prabhupāda," Here Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa photo is cut, it's not good. You have got any in your photo ..."
Śyāmasundara,Not color.,Prabhupāda, May not be color.
Śyāmasundara,Doesn't matter.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor; Yamunā; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Devotee,"Give me afterwards, there is no hurry. And what about those photos you took in town that day? That lady inquires from me every time I go there.; Yamunā : Which one?; Mahāprabhu's photo , Maha (indistinct)?; Guru dāsa : Kṣīrodakaśāyī has those negatives.; Huh ?; Guru dāsa : I think Kṣīrodakaśāyī has those negatives. I'll inquire. Kṣīrodakaśāyī?; He has?; Guru dāsa : He has those negatives. I'll inquire where they are.; If you give me the negatives, I will get them developed.; You want to take massage now, Srila Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, So give some prasādam .
Dr. Kapoor,You are observing Ekādaśī today?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Kapoor,Ekādaśī today?,Prabhupāda, Ekādaśī ? (indistinct)
Dr. Kapoor,"So you are going for that piece of land, that...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor,Garden?,Prabhupāda, Yes. You like that piece of land?
Dr. Kapoor,I like it.,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is nice. Two sides...three sides road."
Dr. Kapoor,Three sides road?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Three sides road, and good locality."
Dr. Kapoor,"This one is all right, of course. This land that you have purchased is very well suited. But that orchard, you see.",Prabhupāda," Orchard, yes. That you can inquire."
Dr. Kapoor,If you want to expand afterwards...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor,...this piece of land may not be sufficient.,Prabhupāda," No, no."
Dr. Kapoor,And that may not be available afterwards. So if you can go in for it just now...,Prabhupāda, Yes. So what actually he wants?
Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,"(indistinct) must have told you?; Guru dāsa : He mentioned that he thought sixty thousand, but he was not positive.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor,"Guru dāsa : He was not sure, but they both said sixty thousand, but they were not sure.; (laughs) Since both of us say sixty thousand, I think you can get in touch.; Guru dāsa : But that is very nice plot. And it is about two times as large as Mr. Dalmia's land, and Mr. Dalmia was asking fifty thousand.; No, he has purchased it for fifty thousand. Sixty thousand is his entire cost, including expenses and everything. I asked him, he told me. Sixty thousand. So from that point, that land is cheap.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,"You have more extensive buildings on it than Dalmia's.; Guru dāsa : What about the adjoining land, it is also available?; Which one?; Guru dāsa : There is some adjoining land behind...; Adjoining which...; Guru dāsa : That sixty thousand...",Prabhupāda, Bon Maharaja bought this land very cheap.
Dr. Kapoor,"Oh, yes. He got it for nothing.",Prabhupāda, Only thirty thousand?
Dr. Kapoor,"No, even less, I think. About ten thousand. But he...",Prabhupāda, He had to spend much money.
Dr. Kapoor,"He got it... It was requisitioned for the college, you see. It was requisitioned.",Prabhupāda," Vṛndāvana University, Vaiṣṇava (indistinct). It was acquired by the government."
Dr. Kapoor,Acquired by the government. That's how he got it cheap. And then he had to go into litigation.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Much litigation, and he was in danger."
Dr. Kapoor; Śyāmasundara,He was in danger.; Still it's not finished.,Prabhupāda, Not yet finished.
Dr. Kapoor; Śyāmasundara; Dr. Kapoor,"Not yet finished? That litigation is still going on?; No, I mean the building.; Building huh . The construction is going on?",Prabhupāda, Now he is getting money.
Dr. Kapoor,Now he is getting money. The institution has been recognized by the government.,Prabhupāda, He is not here. I inquired.
Dr. Kapoor,Perhaps not. I don't know.,Prabhupāda, He's gone to Delhi?
Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa; Dr. Kapoor,"He was trying to force me...; Guru dāsa : Bombay, I think.; ...force the professorship of his college upon me.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Kapoor,When I came here after my retirement...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. I know that. [break] If you want, you can come sometime to European countries to our different branches."
Dr. Kapoor,Why you make me leave Vṛndāvana now? (laughs),Prabhupāda," No, because you have got some background, so you can have very good chance to speak in big institution."
Dr. Kapoor,That's all right.,Prabhupāda," And if our movement is supported in that way, that will be nice."
Dr. Kapoor,"I was out from Vṛndāvana for about a month-and-a-half, that I told you. (laughs)",Prabhupāda, Yes. That was also painful.
Dr. Kapoor,"(indistinct) hell. Although I was with my children, you see, small kiddies, lovely people, you see. And still, you see, I didn't like to stay with them.",Prabhupāda, That I can understand.
Dr. Kapoor; Śyāmasundara; Dr. Kapoor,"I came away. And as I was coming to Vṛndāvana , you see, I think it was by way of punishment, you see, for being..., for remaining outside Vṛndāvana for such a long period that the strange thing happened, you see. And Rādhārāṇī made me undergo a prāyaścitta before I came back. (laughs); A what?; You see, what happened was, it was the...",Prabhupāda," Prāyaścitta . Intonation, what do you call?"
Dr. Kapoor,No.,Prabhupāda," Prāyaścitta , what is the exact English?"
Dr. Kapoor; Devotee,Penance.; Atonement.,Prabhupāda, Atonement.
Dr. Kapoor,"Atonement, yes.",Prabhupāda, Atonement.
Dr. Kapoor,"Atonement. So I was made to undergo atonement, you see. (chuckles) I was coming to Mathurā . I had to drop down some (indistinct) at Mathurā , and I had a trunk and bedding with me. [break] (Hindi), a big volume, about one thousand pages, that he had given to me for revision. So that thing was there, there was one...",Prabhupāda, Bengali?
Dr. Kapoor,Hindi.,Prabhupāda, Hindi.
Dr. Kapoor,"Hindi. One more manuscript. And, of course, there was some jewelry also because my son has been recently married, you see, and there was some jewelry also. That was not so material as this manuscript.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
