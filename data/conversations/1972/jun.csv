Ātreya Ṛṣi,"San Diego is very close to the border of Mexico, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...the cemetery of dog, one becomes dog. Yes, that is stated."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yānti bhūtāni bhūtejyā. ""The worshiper of this bhūta goes to the bhūta . "" Mad -yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25 ] . ""And those who are worshiper of Me, they come to Me."""
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes.,Prabhupāda," A good reason. If you worship Kṛṣṇa , go to Kṛṣṇa . If you worship the dog, you go to dog."
Devotee (1),"Māyāvādīs, they say you can worship anything and it is all the same?",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Devotee (1),Do the Māyāvādīs say you can worship anything and it is all the same?,Prabhupāda," Yes. (chuckles) That is their nonsense. Kṛṣṇa says different thing, but they have manufactured their own way. Is that a temple?"
Devotee (1),"Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's a nice gold dome.",Prabhupāda, It appears as church. It is a church?
Devotee (1); Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes. I do not know what kind. Christian church. [break]; Kṛṣṇa has endowed California with a lot of natural beauty.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),All year around there is nice flowers and green.; Sunshine.,Prabhupāda," And you know how to utilize them. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa has given you this land. Now utilize it and develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It will be heaven."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,We could have an idea like you have in India on the beach for rich people to come and learn Kṛṣṇa consciousness.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,It's a very beautiful spot.,Prabhupāda, Bombay.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Like Bombay. Such an idea, it would be very nice here for all the rich, artists, intelligent people, everybody to come and rest and learn Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",Prabhupāda," Let them learn there and implement the idea here. The whole city, whole country will be glorified."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Jaya . We need to have more cow protection.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"On the West Coast, it would be very nice if we had some cow protection.",Prabhupāda," These people must stop this cow killing, the greatest sin. They should divert their tendency for happiness differently than by killing and drinking."
Devotee (1),They are thinking they cannot live without eating cows.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Devotee (1),They think they cannot live without eating cows.,Prabhupāda," They do not know. We can teach them how to get better vitaminous foodstuff from cow's milk. Yes. Let the cow live, and she supplies her blood in the form of milk, and you take vitaminous foodstuff from milk. That is civilization. Milk is also cow's blood. But take this blood in a humanely way, not by killing. Milk is nothing but blood of cow. Suppose if you kill one cow, you get blood how much, how many pounds?"
Devotee (1),Some number?,Prabhupāda," No, just guess, how many pounds blood you can get?"
Devotee (1),Fifty pounds?,Prabhupāda," Fifty pounds. But if you keep the cows, you get thirty pounds daily. This is intelligence. Instead of getting once fifty pounds and finished, why don't you get it daily thirty pounds?"
Devotee (1); Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Because they're lusty.; We have to set the example, Prabhupāda, through your mercy.",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is foolishness. Just like one has got some money, he utilizes his money and gets daily some income. And if he wants to spend all at once, that is foolishness."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Now they think they are smart. They think they can mass produce animals and mass kill them.,Prabhupāda, Mass killing?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Mass killing. That is... They have factories where they can produce thousands of animals very quickly. Quickly they inject certain vitamins and so on in the animal so that they become fat very fast for mass killing.,Prabhupāda, How they can produce thousands of animals?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"They're producing animals in the laboratories, not with... They're not producing, they are utilizing nature's way, but they don't let the animals see the green and the grass or the outside. They keep them in the barn and just keep feeding them.",Prabhupāda, I don't think it is possible. It is simply imagination.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"It's the cows which are producing each other, it's not the man that is producing. But they artificially try to make them fat fast.",Prabhupāda, And what is the harm if they live?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Excuse me, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, There is enough grass.
Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),"Yes, yes.; This is a nice park.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),Someday we will put on a nice Hare Kṛṣṇa festival here in this park.,Prabhupāda," We shall park here, no?"
Devotee (1),Yes?,Prabhupāda, What do you say?
Devotee (1),If you would like.,Prabhupāda, Anywhere.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"This is a long drive, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It just goes very scenic drive.",Prabhupāda, You go.
Devotee (1),"We could walk for some time, walk along the beach.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),Then we can drive.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (exits car)
Devotee (1),Someday by Kṛṣṇa's grace we'll put a big festival right here. [break],Prabhupāda," ...forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa . When there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is no longer material. That is spiritual."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Those of us who have been blessed by your teachings, we still are conditioned to forget Kṛṣṇa . It's very painful when we forget. I know myself, I am still a rascal. It's very difficult when I forget. [break]",Prabhupāda, It is your duty to give protection.
Devotee (1),"When he was very small, he came back from the temple one Sunday chanting and dancing, and finally we went to see what it was. (end)",Prabhupāda, ...the brain of Einstein.
Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),Brain of who?; Einstein?,Prabhupāda, Einstein.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Well, the way they're doing it is through the genetic, yes.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, they are trying..."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes.,Prabhupāda, ...to make a xerox copy. So why not the original?
Devotee (1),What is that?,Prabhupāda, Explain to him.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Why not the original?,Prabhupāda," Yes. The scientists, they are trying to make a xerox copy of Professor Einstein. So why not the original? Hm? What is their answer?"
Ātreya Ṛṣi,They cannot keep the original alive.,Prabhupāda," No, that's all right, but let them make one original."
Devotee (1),They can't even begin.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (1),They can't even make a cell.,Prabhupāda, Then what is their credit?
Devotee (1),They have made a computer.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (1),"They have made a computer, but it takes a human being to program the computer.",Prabhupāda," So what is their credit? If you simply copy something, that is not credit. The credit should go to the original."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,The scientists admit that there is nothing new that they can make. Everything is the manipulation of the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda," Then the thing is that as they are individual person trying to do something wonderful, the individual person who has already done all this wonderful, how much credit He deserves. If by simply copying you want to take so much credit that you will defy the existence of God, you are so fool, rascal, then how much credit should be given to the original person who has made all these things existing. What is their answer?"
Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),"They simply don't care.; Like that man said last night, ""We will do it.""",Prabhupāda," You will do, that's all right, you will do it, but it is already there. What is your credit, you will do it? It is already there, then what is your credit?"
Ātreya Ṛṣi,They choose to ignore it.,Prabhupāda," Even if you do that, the already one who has done it, why don't you give Him credit?"
Devotee (1),"Yeah, instead of being envious.",Prabhupāda," Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān [ Bg. 16.19 ] , they are envious, rascal. Envious means rascal. That is material quality. And spiritual quality means to praise good quality. ""Oh, you are so nice, you have got so good quality."" That is spiritual. And enviousness, ""Oh, this man is surpassing me. All right, I..."""
Devotee (1),Cut him down.,Prabhupāda, That's right. This is material. Matsaratā. This is explained in Bhāgavata as matsaratā. Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstavaḥ vastu vedyam atra [SB 1.1.2 ] .
Devotee (1),"Last night you said that that man's claim was like a poor man saying, ""Yes, I'll become a millionaire.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),"""Someday I'll become a millionaire.""",Prabhupāda," And he wants the respect of a millionaire immediately, with future tense. Just see. ""You give me the respect of a millionaire. I shall become in future a millionaire."" What is this nonsense? First of all you become millionaire, then ask the respect. They want the credit beforehand. Trust no future, however pleasant. Why shall I believe you?"
Devotee (1),"There's a lake over there. There's a pond, we can walk down there.",Prabhupāda," Oh, bridge we are not going to cross? All right."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Every time they find something new they should be glorifying Krsna .,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is Krsna consciousness.
Devotee (2); Devotee (1); Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),(aside) What's in there?; Peaches.; It's all there.; These are all peach trees.,Prabhupāda," Oh. You have made this nice park, but with the help of God, who has created all these trees. You cannot do that. This means that you try to help or cooperate with God, then your credit is all right. Just like God has created this tree, and you are cooperating to make it nicely trimmed, make this path, this is cooperation. You take this much credit. But the first credit given to God, who has created this tree."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"Does this remind you of Vṛndāvana , Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Is this like Vṛndāvana ?,Prabhupāda, Vṛndāvana is different. This is man-made.
Devotee (2),"Is this like Dvārakā , when Krsna was living in Dvārakā , they had...",Prabhupāda," Yes, Dvārakā , yes. Vṛndāvana trees are all full of fruits and flowers. These are for fuel, these trees."
Devotee (1),For fuel.,Prabhupāda, That's all. For burning. There is no fruits and flowers. [break]
Devotee (1),...come on shore and get drunk and make trouble. They have their own police.,Prabhupāda, Military has their own police.
Devotee (1),Yeah.,Prabhupāda," They are so pious and advanced in civilization, the students require police. The dean has publicly requested police, and still they are very much proud of advancement."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,The police steals too.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),Especially in New York.,Prabhupāda, And police also requires another police. Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad- guṇā [SB 5.18.12 ].
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"All these Indians coming to this country to benefit, maybe we should go to India to take care of Vṛndāvana and all these other lands.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore, this movement is there."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Will we be someday in charge of those?,Prabhupāda," Oh yes, we are already in charge. You simply take charge. Your appointment is already there; simply go and take charge over."
Devotee (1),No one else can even dispute it.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (end)
Devotee (1); Ātreya Ṛṣi; Devotee (1),"This is mung dahl for you, Your Divine Grace.; Is it split?; Yes.",Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Devotee (1); Devotee (2),"Split yellow mung.; No, I think this is urad dahl. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...big squash thrown away decomposes. So the outer skin has become dry. Nobody cares for it. It is lying down, the outer cover of the squash, and one dried bamboo. You have seen, you know bamboo? Pile cut, it is also lying somewhere. And a piece of wire."
Devotee (2),Wire.,Prabhupāda," Wire, that is also lying somewhere. Nobody cares. But one gentleman, he collected all these three things and prepared a string instrument. He joined the bamboo with the dry cover of squash and fitted the string and it began to ting, ting, ting. It is called ektara . There is instrument in India it is called ektara. The example is that so many things individually lying useless. But if somebody knows how to combine them, it becomes an instrument, very sweet. Very sweet to hear. Similarly, in this world, so many things are lying dead and frustrated. But if they are combined together by an expert, it becomes useful. So although this world is dead body, when there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it becomes enlivened. That is our movement. We are trying to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness in everything dead within this world. (Prabhupāda drinks) Now just see all these ingredients, strawberry and..., what is that?"
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Orange juice.,Prabhupāda, Orange and honey...
Devotee (2),Peach.,Prabhupāda," ...and peach, they are natural products from the jungle. Nobody goes to manufacture, automatically comes out. But when they are combined together, it is nectarean. None of them is manufactured by man, either this honey or the strawberry or the pineapple. Given by God. So in every step, you can perceive the hands of God. Every step. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This nice taste you cannot create by any chemical combination. It is not possible. Because God's hand is there, it has become so tasteful drink. Man cannot make. This flower, man cannot make. This fruit... Nothing man can make. This nice flower stick, how nicely it is made. So everything you can perceive the hands of God. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When you perceive the hands of God, presence of God, presence of the energy of God, then you become happy. That is the way of happiness. In every step of life, you feel the hands of God. We are teaching..., this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means how to perceive, realize presence of God in everything. So there will be no disappointment. (to guests:) Take more? Go on eating. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1] . Everything there is. Actually that is a fact. People are so foolish. They are not trained up to understand the presence of God in everything. So we are training that status of life to perceive presence of God in everything. In everything. (pause) This is called peach?"
Śyāmasundara,Um hm. Like those trees we saw on the walk this morning.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,"We saw some peach trees, small ones.",Prabhupāda, This is also peach?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Yes. No peaches in India?,Prabhupāda, Not so big. It is very nice. These fruits are there in India. What is called?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Cherries.,Prabhupāda, Cherry.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,You have sour cherries too?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Sour cherries? It's sour.,Prabhupāda, It is sour?
Ātreya Ṛṣi; Śyāmasundara; Ātreya Ṛṣi,"There is some kind of cherries which is very sour, for cooking.; Those are sweet.; These are sweet.",Prabhupāda, They become bigger more?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,No.,Prabhupāda, What are those biggers?
Śyāmasundara; Ātreya Ṛṣi; Śyāmasundara; Devotee (3),Plums.; There's strawberries.; They're plums. Looks like a cherry.; And these are avocado.,Prabhupāda," Fat. Vegetable fat? It is fatty. These fruits are meant for offering to Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa says, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam . Flowers, leaves, fruits He wants. So these are Kṛṣṇa's food. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [ Bg. 9.26 ] . (devotee enters) What is your problem of life?"
Devotee (3),We're miserable.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Devotee (3),We're miserable.,Prabhupāda, Why miserable?
Devotee (3),We never get satisfaction.,Prabhupāda," Yes. It is good sign, because then you will be searching after the source of satisfaction. The source of satisfaction is Kṛṣṇa . Śānti. Suhṛdaṁ sarva - bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati [Bg. 5.29 ] . When you know Kṛṣṇa as the friend of everyone, at that time you get satisfaction. How nice. Everything is so nice."
Devotee (4),Just see how bright this...,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Devotee (4),...how bright these flowers are.,Prabhupāda," Wherefrom this beauty, nice flower, nice leaves, everything comes? Wherefrom? So I shall have to go?"
Śyāmasundara; Bhaktadāsa,"The television show is at seven?; Bhakta dāsa : Yes, seven o'clock. Would you still like to go for a drive and see some of the city? The car is all ready.",Prabhupāda, (to guest) Take more. Come to our temple daily in the morning at seven. Are you coming there?
Guest,Yes. I was staying at the Detroit temple with Bhagavān .,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Guest,"I was helping the band a little bit. And I came to see you, and I was wondering what I should do to serve you. I should go back to Detroit?",Prabhupāda," Or you can remain here also, anywhere. We have got temple in Los Angeles. Have you been in Los Angeles?"
Guest,No.,Prabhupāda," So come to Los Angeles and stay there for some time. I am going to Los Angeles tomorrow, so you can come. Live with us and you will be happy. We can guarantee you will be happy. Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Our Vedic mission is sarve sukhino bhavantu : everyone be happy. This is our mission. And we know how to become happy. That is our credit. We know. How to become happy we know. Therefore, you can inform others also how to become happy. Happiness is our birthright. Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt ( Vedānta - sūtra 1.1.12) . Living entity is ānandamaya, full of happiness, but they have fallen in a different condition. Therefore unhappy. Different condition. Just like fish taken out of the water and put into the land, a different condition, and it is throbbing, flapping, unhappy. Take it, put it in the water again, and it will be happy. That's it."
Guest,I don't want to take too much of your time up.,Prabhupāda, Thank you very much. (end)
