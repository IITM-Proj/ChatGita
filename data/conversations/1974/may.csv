Dr. Patel,Hlādinī ...,Prabhupāda," Yes. Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65 , purport]. So Rādhārāṇī is the hlādinī - śakti . So when the Parabrahman wants to enjoy, He does not enjoy in this, the material energy. He expands His own pleasure potency. That is Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa tattva .

Dr. Patel,You must act like Parīkṣit .,Prabhupāda, You don't care for danger. You go on chanting. That's all. Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām [SB 10.14.58] .

Dr. Patel,Stalin.,Prabhupāda," No, Germany, whole Germany. They do not like to speak in English also. Yes, I have seen it. Even they know English, they'll not speak. In the bank they could speak a little, little English, but they avoid. Then I took... What is that boy that first went to...?"
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : Śivānanda.,Prabhupāda," Śivānanda. Then I... Śivānanda talked in German. [break] ...two wars is due to Germany's hatred to Britain. That's all. There was always competition in colonization between France, Holland..."

Girirāja,"""Śukadeva Gosvāmī has used the word śraddhānvita for one who is trained in the spiritual life. Śraddhā, or faith, is the beginning.

Girirāja,"""Those who are simply attracted to temple worship but do not know the philosophy of bhakti are in the neophyte stage.""

Dr. Patel,In the south there is...,Prabhupāda," No, everywhere. Everywhere. They do not know. In the temple there is no discussion scientifically about Kṛṣṇa or anything. You see? (Hindi)"

Girirāja,"""One who is actually deriving..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," That is the disease, material disease, to become lusty. So if one actually hears from the authority rāsa - līlā , then he is no more lusty. That is the test. That is the test."

Dr. Patel,You are really... Oscar Wilde has written once...,Prabhupāda," Yes, this is the fact. We can see it. We can see it. That's all. Everywhere the same business. In the Western world they are becoming more and more naked. You see? Mini, miniskirt."

Dr. Patel,Topless and bottomless.,Prabhupāda," These things are going on. That means they are attracted. Attracted. Puṁsāṁ striyā mithunī - bhāvam etad. They'll dress. Woman will dress very nicely so that she can attract man, and man will also do something which will, he'll attract woman. Mithunī - bhāvam tayor mitha ... In this way, when they are united - hṛdāya - granthim āhuḥ , a very strong knot: ""Oh, you are mine. I am yours."" (laughter) ""You are mine. I am yours."" In this way they pull on this material life. And then, gradually, ""Now we must have good apartment to live and enjoy sex life.""

Dr. Patel,"I don't think they should be dog, become dog. They should become hogs.",Prabhupāda," Yes, dog or hog, but the same. There is no much difference. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ [ SB 2.3.19 ] . These animals have been especially mentioned. Śva means dog, and viḍ- varāha means hog. Śva viḍ- varā ..."
Dr. Patel,"Viḍ- varāha : ""dirty eating hog.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. Vit . Vit means stool. Śva-viḍ- varāha - uṣṭra . Uṣṭra means camel, and khara means ass. So these gṛhamedhīs they have been described as the śva , viḍ- varāha , uṣṭra , khara . Bhāgavata is very strong (laughs) in criticizing. Therefore in the beginning it is said, dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo atra : [SB 1.1.2 ] ""All types of cheating religion is rejected."" Dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo atra . Kaitava means cheating. Śrīdhara Swāmī, he has... Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ : ""This Bhāgavata is meant for paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ , those who are above this material existence, paramahaṁsas."" Bhāgavata is not meant for ordinary men."
Dr. Patel,Who can make a distinction between milk and water.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, no, means he accepts only the milk, not the water. Similarly, this whole world is mixture of spirit and matter, so he rejects matter; he takes only spirit. That is paramahaṁsa . Go on."
Girirāja,"""Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that according to Bhagavad- gītā , the Brahmā day and the Brahmā night are periods of solar years expanding 4,300,000 multiplied by one thousand..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," Four, I think. This one?"

Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : So we should observe this festival, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Not necessarily.
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : Not necessary.,Prabhupāda, Go on. [break] ...Tirupati. These rascals are getting money and investing for television.

Indian man (3),"""In the Vedic scriptures, therefore, one is recommended to give charity to a brāhmaṇa .""",Prabhupāda," Because they are not brāhmaṇa . All śūdras, Communist."
Dr. Patel,Janma jāyate śūdraḥ .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Especially, especially that Andhra government is Communist government."
Indian man (3),"""And by so doing, one pleases Lord Viṣṇu and all the demigods. The pilgrims take bath, worship the Deity and give in charity. They are also recommended to fast one day."" [break]",Prabhupāda, ...that after attaining human form of body he is not degraded.

Dr. Patel,Kathopaniṣad says that (Sanskrit). People according to their...,Prabhupāda," Yes, karma ."
Dr. Patel,"...knowledge and according to their karma , even they become these trees.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (3),"""Vidyadhara himself says that even though he was a demigod, he was condemned to become a serpent.

Yadubara,"""I shall also see how You..."" [break] ""...your internal potency You have set up the influence of māyā . "" That is part of the internal potency?",Prabhupāda, Hm? Yes. What is your question?
Yadubara,"Well, I thought it was the external potency.",Prabhupāda," For Him there is no external, internal. For Kṛṣṇa there is no external, internal. You cannot understand this. Kṛṣṇa is absolute. For me there is external, internal, but for Kṛṣṇa there is no external, internal because His energy... The external energy is also His energy, and internal is His energy. Therefore He's everything. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . (Hindi) For electrician there is no difference between refrigerator and heater. He knows how to adjust it. For me, this is heater; this is refrigerator. Like that."
Yadubara,"""You have taken your birth in the Yadu dynasty..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," ...says, ātma - māyayā . Ātma- māyayā , His own energy. So the material energy and the spiritual, both of them, are His energy. So even if He appears in a material body, it does not act as material body. It act as spiritual body. Just like same example: The expert electrician, he can turn the refrigerator into heater. Is it not? That is the way. Hare Kṛṣṇa . For Him there is nothing, no distinction, because He is absolute. Similarly, to take the side of the devotee and to kill the enemy of Kṛṣṇa , they are all the same."
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : Inside of the devotee?,Prabhupāda," Or to kill the demon, that is His mercy. Both of them. It is not that materially, as we think, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa is taking side of this man and killing this man."" No. Still, He is neutral, absolute."
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : The sahajiyās, they don't know that.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Sahajiyās, they just go towards like the rasa - līlā , and they avoid the demon killing.",Prabhupāda, Who?
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : The sahajiyās.,Prabhupāda," Oh, they are rascals. Kick them out. They think everything is easy."
Dr. Patel,What is sahajiyā?,Prabhupāda," Sahajiyā... Sahaj means easy. Easy-going. They will smoke cigarette at the same time they will play rasa - līlā . This is sahajiyā. This is sahajiyā. They will do all nonsense; still, they will become God, imitation of God."
Yadubara,"""Nārada Muni wanted to impress upon people in general that Kṛṣṇa is fully independent. His activities such as His appearance..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," He played also.

Dr. Patel,māyā .,Prabhupāda," No, no, these wonderful scientific advancement, they were done by the demons. So they are demons. These so-called scientist, they re all demons."
Dr. Patel,Palace of Pāṇḍavas were constructed by māyā .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,So they were all engineers.,Prabhupāda," No, no, engineer. Engineer are also demons, but he is no longer demon. Now doctors are demon. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...land only for this beach."
Dr. Patel,But you are going away.,Prabhupāda," No, I am... (Dr. Patel laughs) I am here. [break] Very soon. [break] Living entities are there in the sand. How do they say there is no life in the moon? I cannot understand. What they are eating within the sand?"
Dr. Patel,"Not that, but our definition of life is, I mean, not really complete. It is not complete. We mean... Life means anything which, I mean, which breathes, which beats. That is all humbug. Everything is life, to tell the truth.",Prabhupāda," No, even distinction, life and matter, here is sand. How these animals are living within the sand? And not only that. Now it is... Because it is wet, they are living. When it is very scorchy hot, then also living."
Dr. Patel,That is māyā . This is all māyā .,Prabhupāda, Living entity can exist in any condition. In the sun globe there is life. Go on.
Dr. Patel,Life is caitanya .,Prabhupāda," Yes, caitanya . Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre [Bg. 2.20 ] ."
Dr. Patel,Without caitanya nothing can exist.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Dr. Patel,I think even in an atom there is caitanya .,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Aṇḍāntara- stha paramāṇu -cayāntara- stham [Bs. 5.35] . There is. Go on."
Yadubara,"""I can be sure this opportunity..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," It is His energy, so therefore Kṛṣṇa cannot be under the influence of material energy. [break] Just like, what is called, shade and light. They are the same thing, but shade means the other side of light, absence of light. But light can be there at any time. It is not that because it is shade, there cannot be any light. And this light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is eradicating the darkness of the shady material world. [break] ...taking so much care of the body. Why? Because there is consciousness. Therefore consciousness is important thing, not this body. [break] ...that ""Kaṁsa, this rascal, is sending me to Kṛṣṇa . I'll be able to see Him."" That's all. His business was to see Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,He was a diplomat.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...between demons and gods. So god abides by the order of the Supreme Lord; the demons do not. That's all. They do indirectly, by force. Just like the demon has to die."
Dr. Patel,Both were the sons of Kaśyapa .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Kaśyapa , gods and demons. By their behavior one sect became demons, no?",Prabhupāda," Eh? Yes. Vyāvahāreṇa jāyante . Canakya Paṇḍita has said na kaścid kasyacid mitro na kaścid kasyacid ripuḥ , vyāvahāreṇa jāyante : ""Who is friend and who is enemy, it can be understood by the behavior.""

Dr. Patel,And he fell off from Gandhi's movement.,Prabhupāda," Hm. Go on. [break] ... rāga of love. When one goes to see his beloved and thinks so many things, ""I'll do this, I'll do this, I'll do this,"" that is pūrva - rāga . Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . [break] ...gopīs as krūra , not Akrūra ."
Dr. Patel,"Yes, because he was taking away Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from there. [break]",Prabhupāda, ... manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya - kṛttamaḥ . Kṛṣṇa recognizes immediately who preaches the gospel of Bhagavad- gītā . Yes.

Dr. Patel,United Nations were created...,Prabhupāda," No, no, not only United Nation, united in everything, ""universal brotherhood,"" whatever you call-here is the example."
Dr. Patel,So-called United Nations were created not for unity.,Prabhupāda," No, no, either so-called United Nation or so-called nation. Here is also there is nation. What do they know about nation? Everyone, he is interested with his own pocket. That's all. ""What money is coming in my pocket."" That's all. Where is the nationality? If there was nationality, why such havoc could have happened? Now the strike is going on. There is no feeling of nationality because they are not thinking of the nation; they are thinking of their own pocket, that's all. Where is the nationality? They are simply bogus slogans. Actual unity, nationality, universality, is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is a fact. Let them see. Men, women also. There are women also. We do not hate anyone. Come on. Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
Dr. Patel,"This M.N. Raya , you know, who advocated that humanism, for which he was banished by the Communist fellows because the root of M.N. Raya was in Hinduism, no? After all? It is very difficult for us to think about so-called Communism. But religion itself is Communistic.",Prabhupāda," No, no. We, we don't think in terms of Hinduism. We don't think."
Dr. Patel,"No. But we have been actually brought up religiously as communists, religious communists.",Prabhupāda," Spiritual communists. Religious, religious upon strict sense of religion. Religion means spiritualism."
Dr. Patel,"Yes, spiritual communism.",Prabhupāda," Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat - praṇītam [SB 6.3.19 ] . Religion means to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa . That is religion. Other things are cheating. If they have no sense of God, they do not know what is God, how to abide by the orders of God, that is not religion. Therefore Bhāgavata says, dharmaḥ - projjhita kaitavo atra : [SB 1.1.2 ] ""All cheating types of religion system is rejected, kicked out from this Bhāgavata . "" They're all cheating. ""I am God. You are God. I am everything. You are..."" This is not religion. It is all humbug religion. Go on. [break] ...has written about Kṛṣṇa by Vyāsadeva, and people say, ""There was no Kṛṣṇa . It is all fictitious."" Vyāsadeva had to take so much trouble for some fictitious. Just see their intelligence. Even no common sense. Why Śukadeva Gosvāmī will take interest? Why Vyāsadeva will write such book? Therefore they do not recognize that Bhāgavata is written by Vyāsadeva. But how they can deny? Bhagavad- gītā , that is also written by Vyāsadeva."
Yaśomatīnandana; Dr. Patel,"So-called scholars like Rādhākrishnan says, ""It is, Vyāsadeva, is some imaginary character.""; Why they say even Vyāsadeva is imaginary?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Patel,"They say, some of them, there was not one Vyāsadeva, but multiple Vyāsas and all sorts of things.",Prabhupāda, So which Vyāsa you accept? There may be multiple but which Vyāsa ? That means if someone... I do not know if there were multiple Vyāsadeva.
Dr. Patel,Vyāsa is the surname.,Prabhupāda," No, Vyāsa , Vyāsadeva... The guru is called Vyāsa . That is one... But the original Vyāsa is one. Just like we. We worship the birthday of guru as Vyāsa - pūjā day because guru is representative of Vyāsa . [break] ...eating, if this tāmbūla is offered and sandal pulp, it becomes a garland. It becomes very comfortable. Yes."
Yadubara,"""When Akrūra finished eating..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," The guest may be comfortable. Sukham āsīnam . He is seated very nicely, comfortably, then talk. This is the system. Receiving guests and talking. [break] ""Beware of dog. Beware of dog. I am living with dog. Don't come here."" He poses that ""I am friend of... Dog is my best friend, so don't come here."" Yes. His overfaithfulness has obliged him to take the body of a dog."
Yadubara,"""The Vedic system of receiving a guest was completely observed by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself to teach all others how..."" [break]",Prabhupāda," Even if you receive at home your enemy, you shall treat him in such a way that he is not afraid. Akuto 'bhayam. That ""I have come to the house of enemy and he can do me harm at any time,"" no. He should be received in such a way that he will be completely free from these thoughts, that ""I am his enemy."""
Dr. Patel,"These Arabs were well known about receiving these guests like that, but they have learned from India.",Prabhupāda," Yes, they were all Indians. All this land... Now just like they have become Pakistan. They were Indians, Hindu . Because we degraded in our culture, the divisions, the so many divisions... Otherwise whole world are under Vedic culture. As soon as the brāhmaṇas and the..., or kṣatriyas, they degenerated, the whole society disrupted."
Dr. Patel,Now the brāhmaṇa is trying to regenerate.,Prabhupāda," Now he is above brāhmaṇa . Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma - bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. 14.26 ] . He is brahma - bhūtaḥ , not brāhmaṇa ."

Girirāja,"(reading) ""Kṛṣṇa, who advented Himself just to kill all undesirable elements in the world...""",Prabhupāda," Yes. Similarly, this movement is advented to kill all the so-called yogis, swamis, avatāras, rascals, philosophers, commentators. We have to kill. Kill means... Where is your tilaka ? You did not have tilaka in the morning?"
Devotee,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Ah. So this is our one of the items, to vanquish all these rascals, so-called swamis. They say that ""Why you criticize others also?"" Because we have to vanquish them. Now these people cannot rise. When there is sunrise, there is no use of these glowworms. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Therefore they must be finished, all over the world. So-called religionists, so-called philosophers, so-called avatāras, swamis, yogis—finished. Our program should be like that.

Dr. Patel,"Even though they have realized the extraordinary quality of the sun, but they have not been able to think that he is God incarnate.",Prabhupāda," This means these things, these sentiments-anxiety, grief, anger, all these things—they are constant companion with the living entity. You cannot give it up. But when they are used for Kṛṣṇa , that is perfection. That is upādhi - śūnya , without any designation."
Satsvarūpa,"Prabhupāda, we are only neophytes. How we can know if our anxiety is still material when we feel anxiety in devotional service?",Prabhupāda," No, no. If you feel anxiety for Kṛṣṇa , then it is not material. That anxiety is not... That is love. That is pure love, that... Why you become anxious for our children? Because there is love. So whole scheme is that you have to transfer your attachment to Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,All bhakti should be directed to the sacred feet of Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Mayy āsakta - manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan . This is called bhakti - yoga . Mayy āsakta . The aśakti , the attachment, is for so many things. Now we have to concentrate it on Kṛṣṇa . This is bhakti - yoga . Mayy āsakta manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad - āśrayaḥ . Simply by this concentration of an attraction to Kṛṣṇa , you become liberated. This is the process."
Dr. Patel,First you must perfect your thinking of Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. When you think of Kṛṣṇa , you are on the transcendental position. You are not in the material world. Māṁ ca vyabhicāriṇi bhakti - yogena yaḥ sevate , sa guṇān samatītya etān . He is immediately transcendental to all the qualities of material world."
Dr. Patel,Then he becomes brahma - bhūta [SB 4.30.20 ].,Prabhupāda," Yes. So if continuously... That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. If you continuously remain yourself, thinking of Kṛṣṇa , smārtavyaḥ satato viṣṇu vismārtavyo na jatucit . This is the process: You have to think of Kṛṣṇa always.

But here..."

Dr. Patel,That is why they are... I am getting sidetracked.,Prabhupāda," They think that these are the processes, mechanical process. Kṛṣṇa - bhakti is not mechanical. It is spontaneous.

Dr. Patel,Because it was very late to come back from... [break],Prabhupāda," Same sentiment, but in relation with Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,These sentiments are not absent in American society these days. That is why these boys are neglected by the parents. [break],Prabhupāda," ...philosophers, Vedāntists. They were small children, woman, village persons and animals. But they were so much, I mean to say, full with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the perfection. [break] They're so fortunate. [break] Anxiety is also thinking of Kṛṣṇa , nothing else but Kṛṣṇa : ""How Kṛṣṇa was smiling with us, how He was playing."" That is natural. If you have got love for anyone."
Dr. Patel,"""What will happen to us when He is not there?""",Prabhupāda, Yes. Thinking of Kṛṣṇa .
Dr. Patel,"To think, it surrounds...",Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...everything is there, but centered around Kṛṣṇa . [break] Govinda viraheṇa me. Śūnyāyitāṁ jagat sarvam .

Dr. Patel; Girirāja,"He was just a boy of five, six, seven years. [break]; ...about a hundred hoods, how could Kṛṣṇa manage all of those hoods?",Prabhupāda," Oh, then you do not understand Kṛṣṇa . You are trying to understand Kṛṣṇa from your point of view. Kaliya may have unlimited number of hoods; still, Kṛṣṇa can expand Himself. That is Kṛṣṇa . You are thinking Kṛṣṇa from your standpoint of view."
Girirāja,"So He did it, He expanded Himself.",Prabhupāda, Oh yes.
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : But did the residents of Vṛndāvana see the many expansions or did they only see one Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," They may see one. That is not very difficult to understand. Just like Arjuna saw the virāṭa - rupa of Kṛṣṇa , and others saw Kṛṣṇa as chariot driver. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious people, their seeing of Kṛṣṇa and ordinary man's seeing of Kṛṣṇa , there is much difference. They think that ""What is this? A boy, a village boy, they are worshiping."" One so-called sādhu in Haridvar he has remarked like that, that ""Bhaktivedanta Swami is worshiping a rural boy."""
Indian Man; Bhāgavata,That was in the Times.; Bhāgavata : A rural God.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (laughing)
Girirāja,Another thing we were discussing yesterday is that in Goloka there are no demons.,Prabhupāda," No. There cannot be any demons. Then how it is Vaikuṇṭha ? Vaikuṇṭha means without any anxiety. So the situation of anxiety is created by the demons. Therefore, when Kṛṣṇa wants to fight, He has to come down here because there is no question of fighting. There is no chance of fighting. Everyone is devotee. A devotee will never agree. But they will agree Kṛṣṇa's fight, but here, in this field."
Girirāja,"But the sentiment of anxiety or fear for Kṛṣṇa , is that sentiment in Goloka ?",Prabhupāda," No. There is no such thing. That is separation. Just like gopīs, they are full of anxiety: ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa has gone to the pasturing ground."" Their anxiety is there. Just like Rukmiṇī , she was thinking, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa may not give me up. He is talking in this way."" She fainted. So anxiety is there. So the anxiety is that one may not be separated from Kṛṣṇa . That is the anxiety. And actually there is no separation, but the feeling of separation out of ecstatic love. Just like one who has got love for the other person, beloved, he always thinks like that, ""My beloved may not be separated from me."" This is ecstasy of love. Just like a miser man who has got much wealth, he always thinks, ""My money may not be lost. My money may not be lost."" Out of his too much attachment for the money, he thinks like that. Is it not? ""How shall I protect this money? How shall I protect this?"" To earn money is also troublesome. To keep money also troublesome. And when it is lost, that is also troublesome. This is the position. But there is no such thing, loss, but the anxiety is there. We shall return from here? [break] ... vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām . So both the sādhu and the duṣkṛtina, by Kṛṣṇa's two activities, act differently to the devotees and to the demons. They realize. That is their achievement. By punishment, this Kāliya realized, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord."" And devotees, by out of love, they realize. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is Absolute. In either process He is realized. Mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ . If one is sincere, then they gradually make progress. Yes. [break] ... vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām ."
Girirāja,"""O Lord, You have descended especially for the purpose of annihilating all kinds of disturbing elements within the world, and because You are the Absolute Truth, there is no difference between Your mercy and punishment."" [break]",Prabhupāda," ...surgical operation is there, the knife is being used on the body, that means he is getting relief. It is not punishment. Hare Kṛṣṇa . (Hindi) [break]"
Girirāja,Is that benefit coming in all suffering or only when it is given by Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. When there is suffering given by Kṛṣṇa ... Therefore a devotee does not take seriously suffering. Tat te 'nukampāṁ susumīkṣamāṇaḥ [ SB 10.14.8] . A devotee thinks, ""It is the favor of Kṛṣṇa that he has put me into suffering."" They never see suffering as suffering. It is favor of Kṛṣṇa . That is devotee's vision. [break] It is exactly like a son who knows his father well. If the father slaps, the son never protests. He knows that ""It is good for me."" Similarly, a devotee is never disturbed when there is suffering given by Kṛṣṇa . [break]"
Girirāja,A karmī is suffering just the laws of...,Prabhupāda," The karmī is different. The karmī is suffering. He is suffering just like criminal is suffering. A criminal is given slap by the police. That slap, and the father is giving slap, that slap is different. Although it looks the same thing, but there is great difference."
Satsvarūpa,So there is no benefit to suffering unless it is connected with Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. When Kṛṣṇa ... Therefore we shall fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa . As Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, mārobi rākhobi yo icchā tohārā: ""Now I surrender. Now if you want to maintain me, that is all right, and if You want to kill me, that is also all right."" This is surrender. It is not business, ""If You maintain me, then I surrender. If You kill me, then I do not."" It is not like that. Mārobi rākhobi yo icchā tanhārā . ""As You like. If You want to maintain, that is also good; if You want to kill, that is also good."" This is devotee's view."
Satsvarūpa,"Someone might say, ""But if one is surrendered why should Kṛṣṇa give him trouble?""",Prabhupāda," Yes, it is because he is always free. Why do you make Kṛṣṇa dependent on your so-called goodwill, that ""Kṛṣṇa must give me always pleasure""? This is sense gratification. This is sense gratification that you approach Kṛṣṇa for your comfort, sense gratification. That is not bhakti . That is sense gratification. Prahlāda Mahārāja was given suffering by his father so harshly, but he never said, ""Oh, I am devotee and Kṛṣṇa giving me so much trouble? Oh! Give it up."" He never said that. Neither he asked Kṛṣṇa to come and save him. That is Kṛṣṇa - bhakti . The Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas, they were always with Kṛṣṇa and they were suffering. They never asked Kṛṣṇa that ""You are the Supreme, and why we are suffering?"" Never said. Never said. That is Kṛṣṇa - bhakti ."
Girirāja,"""Because You are the Absolute Truth, there is no difference between Your mercy and punishment.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is to be understood. If we understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Absolute Truth, then this is understanding, that either suffering or enjoying, it is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy. There must be some purpose. When Kṛṣṇa puts me into suffering, there must be some purpose. So we should welcome because it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Tat te 'nukampāṁ susumīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātmā- kṛtaṁ vipākam [ SB 10.14.8] . (Hindi) [break] ""...misdeeds. It is Kṛṣṇa's mercy that He is reforming me, slightly suffering. I would have suffered very greatly on account of my past deeds, but He is kindly accommodating me by giving little suffering. That's all."" [break] ...by the wife of Kāliya ."
Girirāja,"[break] ""...that this creature, appearing in the body of a serpent, must have been overburdened with all kinds of sins. Otherwise how could he have the body of a serpent? Your dancing on his hoods reduces all the sinful results of actions caused by his having this body of a serpent."" [break]",Prabhupāda," ...to becomes angry by Kṛṣṇa is auspicious, auspicious. It is a very nice verse. ""It is very auspicious that you have become angry upon him. He is getting salvation."" [break] ...the punishment of Kṛṣṇa , one has to execute many pious activities in his past life, just to get the punishment of Kṛṣṇa . And what to speak of love of Kṛṣṇa , how much pious activities one has to do. If for being punished by Kṛṣṇa , one has to undergo lots of pious activities in the past life, then just see, to be loved by Kṛṣṇa , how much one has to undergo pious activities. Kṛta - puṇya - puñjāḥ [ SB 10.12.11] . That is described. Kṛta - puṇya - puñjāḥ . Puñja means heaps, volumes, volumes of pious activities. Then one can come to Kṛṣṇa . Yeṣām anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya - karmaṇām . Nobody can come to Kṛṣṇa unless he has background of pious activities and one who has become freed from all sinful activities. Yeṣām anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya - karmaṇām . This is the qualification. [break]"
Girirāja,"...some of our disciples, it is seems that in this life they did many sinful activities.",Prabhupāda," But because they have surrendered, all sinful activities is counteracted. Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66 ] . Anyone surrenders sincerely to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa , immediately he becomes free from all reaction of sinful life. Because he is saved. Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ : ""Don't worry."" This is the process. So however one might have done or executed so many sinful activities, if he fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa , then everything is counteracted immediately. But not that repetition, that ""I surrender to Kṛṣṇa ; then again I'll do some sinful activities and again I surrender."" This business will not be allowed. This is called nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa - buddhiḥ . That is the greatest sin, on the strength of Kṛṣṇa's mercy, to go on repeating sinful activities. That is greatest sin. Kṛṣṇa can excuse you - ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣa ..., mā śucaḥ — but you don't make it business, that ""I commit all sinful activities and surrender to Kṛṣṇa to counteract."" No, this is not good. This will not be allowed. [break] ...but you cannot cheat him. Then you'll suffer."
Girirāja,"[break] ""...been pleased by his undergoing all kinds of penances and austerities, and he must have executed universal welfare activities for all living creatures.

Although there is little happiness, but what is the comparison? Vāri bindu sama . I want water, but it is a drop of water. Vāri bindu . Hare Kṛṣṇa .

Yaśomatīnandana,I suggested. [break],Prabhupāda," For nothing. No, no, that is not possible. These are for the karmīs, bodily concept of life. If government has got so many hospitals, what is the use of opening a teeny hospital by us? Vivekananda policy—to collect money by school and hospital. So you can tell him that ""At the present moment, we are concerned about the sanction of the building and temple. So when the building is there, then we can consider, not at the present moment. We require money. We collect for this purpose. We cannot divert attention for medicine and other things."""
Indian Devotee (5),Actually I could gather that he just talked because he also said that we should train up some devotees to do bandage and other things like that.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) No, no, this is not."
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : We do all the work, and he gets advertised as a great charitable doctor.",Prabhupāda, That's it.
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : That he has opened the clinic.,Prabhupāda, Daridra - nārāyaṇa - sevā . We are not all these false things. Doctor Ghosh is also after daridra - nārāyaṇa - sevā .

They have no brain to understand. They are coming down again. Just like the dog's tail. Know, dog's tail. You may, however grease it... (laughs) They are hearing about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Girirāja,"(reading) ""She frankly proposed to Kṛṣṇa , 'My dear hero, I cannot leave you...' """,Prabhupāda," She was a prostitute. She was a prostitute but engaged in Kaṁsa's service. In India the prostitutes are engaged as maidservants in respectable houses still. During daytime they serve in some house, and at night they become prostitute. There are many prostitutes. One prostitute, when we were boys, she was coming to serve my mother as a lady barber. There is lady barber, for serving the ladies. And at night she was standing as prostitute. [break] ...a good relation with the neighborhood. There was no enviousness. ""She is doing her own business. That's all."""
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : So then it is looked on as a necessity in the society.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Prostitute is necessity. Otherwise these rascals, they will pollute all the woman. Therefore, for the rascals there must be some provision. Just like opening wine shop. It is not meant for everyone. But there are drunkards. Unless they get drinking, they will create some disturbance."
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : So just like in Dvārakā there was prostitutes, and they were all devotees of Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Yes. There are many devotees, prostitutes."
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : So that was their service, not their service, but that was their work.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : But, still they were devotees of Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is their profession, livelihood, but they are devotees. In Calcutta, there is a big temple. It is called Kāca -Kāminī's temple. Kāca -Kāminī means she was a prostitute, but she was kept by a very big businessman who was dealing in glass, mirrors and all... So he has made a temple for her with glass and mirrors. Therefore it is called kāca . Kāca means glass. Kāca -Kāminī. [break] ...have a dispensary. Dr. Ojha .

Devotee,It came off.,Prabhupāda," No, it is all right."
Devotee; Yogeśvara,"There's another one underneath. (end); Yogeśvara : ""It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord over the material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.""",Prabhupāda," So this is our... because we are developing a different consciousness... Different... Consciousness is one, but it is being colored under different circumstances. And therefore we have to accept a similar type of body. So if our consciousness is cleansed, then we do not undergo the circumstantial changes by different species of life. That is required. In the human form of life we can do that, not to associate with the modes of material nature, but associate with God. That we can do. And if we associate with God, then we become liberated from the clutches of māyā . Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te . And our real business is how to get out of the clutches of māyā ."
Guest,Give up this staying here?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,How?,Prabhupāda, We have to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness because such consciousness will help us to be free from the contamination of these different types of material consciousness and save us from transmigrating from one body to another. So we accept this different association on account of our strong propensity for sense gratification. Therefore we have to purify the senses so that the senses may be engaged in the service of the master of the senses. Hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa - sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate .
Devotee; Guest,"Your master, does he study Bhagavad- gītā ?; My master is a teacher of the science of the soul.",Prabhupāda, What is that science of the soul?
Guest,"Well, just like what you have been saying, purifying the senses and becoming in consciousness through a master, to know a way of purification by not..., living(?) properly and thinking properly.",Prabhupāda, The idea is purify the senses.
Guest,"And meditation, meditation. Being devoted, your life will be changed. The master teaches these things, purification. He has written also some books. When he came to America in 1967, I met him personally. And he initiated a group of people. And I was also aiming at that, being a vegetarian a few years prior to that. He accepted me and gave me initiation with the group. And, of course, he went back in about... He stayed in the States about twelve days then he came in Europe. Then he went back. I haven't seen him ever since. I have a picture of him. I carry a picture of him, the leader of, in our movement. (indistinct) meditating on the master. And I try to live up to it, to the teachings.

He came back with me from Ireland just a few weeks ago.",Prabhupāda," We are also writing books, so many. You have seen our books?"
O'Grady,"I have seen some, yes, because some of the friends have come up and...",Prabhupāda," Some of the books, you can show him. Here is one book, Bhagavad- gītā ."
Yogeśvara; O'Grady; Yogeśvara; Bhagavān; O'Grady; Bhagavān; Bob Jackson(?); O'Grady; Bhagavān; O'Grady; Bhagavān; O'Grady,"Yogeśvara : You have seen the Bhagavad- gītā , haven't you, in English?; Oh, yes, but not this particular edition.; Yogeśvara : This we just recently published in German, a German edition.

When you came to the house...; The text is in...; Bhagavān : There's original text in Bengali. This book is in Bengali.; And Sanskrit.; Bhagavān : Sanskrit, which Prabhupāda translates himself and gives the explanation and purport. Every night Śrīla Prabhupāda dictates into a dictaphone, and his secretaries type and edit. And then we have a press in New York which composes and prints.; It's a very nice edition, that Macmillan edition. Very nicely done.",Prabhupāda," Yes, they have fifth edition within two years. Five editions."
O'Grady,Five editions in two years.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And each time they print fifty thousand books.
O'Grady,This new printing.,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . In London about few months ago we got report they sold thirty thousand copies in two months.
O'Grady,Thirty thousand.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Woman,In which country of Europe has the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement been the most powerful or successful?,Prabhupāda, Everywhere.
Woman,Every one?,Prabhupāda," Everywhere, yes. In Africa, in America, in Canada, in Japan , in China. Most successful in America. Most successful-many men have taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement."
Woman,What about Greece?,Prabhupāda, I never went to Greece.
Satsvarūpa,You said you went to the airport and they were chanting.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
O'Grady; Woman; Bhagavān; Woman,Really?; I would think they would be in danger in Athens.; Bhagavān : It is danger.; There's no way that this movement could be very successful in Athens or in Greece. Not too many things are successful in Greece.,Prabhupāda," Yes, when I was going to Nairobi from London I got down, transit, on the hall. Some young men, as soon as they saw me, they began to chant, Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
O'Grady,"No, really? In Greece, this was, in Athens?",Prabhupāda," Athens, yes."
O'Grady,"Incredible. What about in Rome ? What kind of... Do you think they're going... Well, they're asking about problems with the police and getting (indistinct).",Prabhupāda, That problem is everywhere.
O'Grady,Everywhere.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Police sometimes harass us, and they become later on tired and do not do anything. (chuckles) Arresting, arresting, they become tired."
O'Grady,They become tired.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
O'Grady,"The system gives up. That's a marvelous solution. Because I feel very tired with the system myself. So there's something wrong with the system as being. So maybe you can give me some advice how to beat the system. Because I assure you, here in Rome ...",Prabhupāda," But you Irish people, you are never tired to fight. (laughter)"
O'Grady,No. We've been fighting for three thousand years now.,Prabhupāda, I think the fighting is going on still.
O'Grady,"Very much so. Very badly, very bad now, very bad. What do you do about that? And that's a serious question. Is it morally correct to be sitting here, for me to be sitting here...",Prabhupāda," You see, so long people will remain under the bodily concept of life, that ""I am this body,"" ""I am Irish,"" ""I am English,"" ""I am American,"" ""I am Italian,"" so long this misconception will go on, fight will go on. You see? Yasyātmā- buddhiḥ kuṇape tri - dhātu ... There is a verse in Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . Just like you cannot stop fighting between the dogs and cats. Why there is fighting? Because the dog is thinking, ""I am dog."" The cat is thinking, ""I am cat."" Similarly, if I think as Irishman, ""I am Englishman,"" it is the same thing. As the dog is thinking, ""I am dog,"" so if I think, ""I am Irishman,"" ""I am Englishman,"" I am no better than the dog. So as we cannot stop the fighting between dogs, similarly, so long people will remain in bodily concept of life, the fighting cannot be stopped."
O'Grady,What was Mahatma Gandhi fighting in the House of Commons in England?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is also another dogism. Because there is no difference. Just try to understand. The dog is thinking, ""I am dog."" Why? Because he has got the body of a dog. Similarly, if I am thinking, ""I am Indian"" because I have got the body in the Indian soil, where is the difference? There is no difference."
O'Grady,The Englishman thinks there's a difference.,Prabhupāda," No, anyone. The bodily concept of life is animalism. When we think that ""I am not this body; I am spirit soul,"" then there is peace. Otherwise there cannot be any peace. Sa eva go- kharaḥ [SB 10.84.13] . In the Vedic literature it is described that persons who is in the bodily concept of life, he is exactly like the cow and the ass. That means animal. So people has to transcend this qualitative conception of existence. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . You will find this verse. Find out this verse,"
Nitāi,"Nitāi : Yes, 14.26.",Prabhupāda, Purport.
O'Grady,"The best truth, and I think it's truth for most of us who take ourselves seriously...",Prabhupāda," Just like in our society, we have got Americans, we have got Africans, Canadians, Indians, Christians, Jews, Mohammedans. But they are no longer Mohammedan, American, Christian or African. They are all servants of Kṛṣṇa . And that is Brahmān realization."
O'Grady,But that's giving it a name also.,Prabhupāda," Yes, name, must be there. But name... Just like you are feeling as Irishman, but your name may be different from another Irishman. How do you feel that ""We are all Irishmen""? The name may be different. That doesn't matter. But the quality can be one. That is required. So when acquires that quality, Kṛṣṇaite quality, that in spite of different names... That is called so 'ham. One feels... The same example: In a nation, in a group, the names may be different, but because they feel nationally or religiously one, so that is one. Varieties. Varieties may be different, but the object being one, that is oneness. What is that, brahma - bhūtaḥ prasannātmā?"
O'Grady; Nitāi; O'Grady; Nitāi; O'Grady,"Could you read the opening little bit again?; Nitāi : In the purport?; Yeah.; Nitāi : ""To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma - bhūta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word.""; O.K. Now, is the Absolute internal or external?",Prabhupāda," Absolute has no internal or external. That is Absolute. If there is internal and external, it is not Absolute."
O'Grady,"I don't mean in time, and I don't mean in space. I mean in time in the sense that one is born and one dies, etc., that is, in one's own time, one's own Absolute, ultimately the Absolute that one finds for oneself.",Prabhupāda," No, we are not absolute. We, when we are situated in the absolute platform, then we are absolute. Now we are in the relative world. Here there is absolutism, but the sense is not so elevated to understand the absolutism. So so long we are under the control of time, there is no question of becoming absolute."
O'Grady,So therefore there is a life beyond time.,Prabhupāda, That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā .
Nitāi,"Nitāi : Chapter Four, text nine:",Prabhupāda," And that is absolute. When he goes back to home, back to Godhead, that is absolute. So long he is in the material world, changing body, transmigrating from one body to another, that is not absolute plane. That is the duality plane, dualism. When we go back to home, back to..., in the spiritual world, that is absolute."
O'Grady,When he goes back to his original.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Thank you very much. That is the position. That is absolute.
O'Grady,So you don't find it possible to achieve any absolute condition in our time?,Prabhupāda," No. In the material world it is not possible. This is the world of duality. Therefore so many different varieties of unity is suggested, but they are all failure. Just like when we were students in 1917, so there was League of Nations. And after that again there was war. (chuckles)"
O'Grady,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," And then, now they have manufactured United Nations. But for the last twenty years or more than that, they are endeavoring to be united, but when I go New York, I see flags are increasing, no united, disunity. You see? And war is going on. Therefore, on this material platform this so-called unity is impossible. Unity is possible only on the spiritual platform."
O'Grady,"I'm not saying it's possible to achieve it. I'm not even thinking it's possible. I'm not even saying that I think it's desirable to achieve happiness in this life, in this world. Because I have a feeling, an intuition that...",Prabhupāda," No, there is possibility—when the consciousness is purified. That we are preaching, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, so long the consciousness is polluted, if I think that ""I am Irishman,"" ""I am Englishman,"" ""I am Indian,"" ""I am white,"" ""I am black..."""
O'Grady,Christian.,Prabhupāda," ""I am Christian,"" ""I am Hindu ,"" they are all contaminated. There is no possibility of unity in the contact of this world."
O'Grady,That's very... I'll accept that.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
O'Grady,"But supposing you think that you are neither an Irishman nor an Englishman or American, nor Christian, nor a Jew nor anything...",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is negation. Then you must say also what you are."
O'Grady,"I am a mortal human being, a member of the animal kingdom.",Prabhupāda, No human being is immortal.
O'Grady,"Mortal, mortal, mortal.",Prabhupāda, Mortal.
O'Grady,"That which dies, rots and is forgotten.",Prabhupāda," That is some conception, mortality. Mortal? Mortality is not absolutism. So long you are mortal, you are not on the absolute platform because you are actually immortal. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā , na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit . Find out. Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit ."
O'Grady,"But is there anything wrong with accepting the fact that you are mortal, you die, you rot and you become nothing?",Prabhupāda, No. That is the polluted conception. Actually you are immortal; you do not die. That is your position. Read this verse.
Nitāi,Nitāi :,Prabhupāda," That is it. That is the position of the soul. So when there is mortality, that is not perfect stage. And when he attains the stage of again immortality... Because actually he is immortal."
O'Grady,Actuality is immortal.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
O'Grady,"Hm, not bad. Because actuality has to do with effect.",Prabhupāda, Yes. The actuality is immortal. He never takes birth...
O'Grady; Yogeśvara; O'Grady,"Never takes bath?; Yogeśvara : Birth.; Oh, never takes birth, true. But immortality, I mean, actuality, of course, has to do with the actuality of the situation that we have right now, with you sitting there and we, as friends, sitting with you and engaging in gentle conversation.",Prabhupāda," Actually... Just like you are sitting in a different dress; I am sitting in a different dress. So the dress does not affect our actuality. We are human being. Similarly, the conception of body—""I am Irishman, I am Englishman, I am Hindu , I am Muslim, I am Christian,""—these are different dresses. So one has to become free from these designations."
O'Grady,Accepted.,Prabhupāda," So when one is free from the designations, then he becomes purified."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : That can be experienced in the present.,Prabhupāda," Yes, by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And practically, you are coming from different groups-Americans, Indians, Africans—but you don't think yourself as American or Indian or African."
O'Grady; Bhagavān,"But the system insists that you do.; Bhagavān : The world as it is, the society, the materialistic society, puts these bodily demands...",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. The materialistic society means duality.
O'Grady,But that's unavoidable.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
O'Grady,Because of your physical existence...,Prabhupāda," Unavoidable, yes..."
O'Grady,And your personal spiritualism as well.,Prabhupāda, But it can be avoided in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like the leaf of lily. It is in the water but it does not touches the water.
O'Grady; Bhagavān; Yogeśvara; Bhagavān,"I didn't catch that last expression, no.; Bhagavān : Lily leaf.; Yogeśvara : To show how we can live in this world but still be transcendental.; Bhagavān : There's a lily leaf that sits on the water and even though it sits on the water it doesn't get wet.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhagavān; O'Grady; Atreya Ṛṣi; O'Grady,"Bhagavān : Prabhupāda is explaining we can be in this world...; But I don't think you can explain situations in one realm, in one area, in the terminology of situations in another one. Because if you put this element and this element together, you get salt. Now, if human nature was the same with that element in that person and that element in that person, you should also get salt. So if you've got fifty million elements and fifty million elements here you should get a mountain of salt.; If you can try to understand this example.; Oh, I can, understand.",Prabhupāda," What is that, salt? Salt example was... Explain."
Yogeśvara; O'Grady,Yogeśvara : What was your point?; I'm saying its difficult to argue about one kind of situation in terms of another kind of situation when the nature of the problem or the nature of the result is different.,Prabhupāda," No, the kinds or varieties may remain, but sometimes the varieties help. Just like if you bring varieties of flower in a vase , it becomes very beautiful, but they are all flowers. So you have to become flowers. So even in varieties there is unity of beauty."
O'Grady,"Yes, I accept that, of course.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So that is... [break]
Atreya Ṛṣi,...there's a great different between that and what we know today as Christians. They're designations. We are not talking...,Prabhupāda," That is another point. The thing is that Christ came to preach the message of God. So therefore, to become actually Christ conscious means God conscious."
O'Grady,"God conscious, exactly. And to become God conscious means...",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa conscious.
O'Grady,To become self conscious.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
O'Grady,To be conscious of who you are yourself.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. God consciousness includes self consciousness. But self consciousness is not God consciousness. God consciousness includes self consciousness, but self consciousness is not God consciousness."
O'Grady,"Well, it may be.",Prabhupāda, No.
O'Grady,"You may achieve recognition of the God that's in yourself, of that aspect.",Prabhupāda, When you are God conscious...
O'Grady,"Without being pantheistic, you mean?",Prabhupāda," Just Like if you come in front of the sunlight, the sun consciousness is there, which includes your personal conscious... you also see. In the darkness you cannot see. At night you do not see even your hands and legs. But if you come in front of the sun, or light, then you see the sun and see yourself. So without the sunlight, without God consciousness, self consciousness is incomplete. But God consciousness makes self consciousness very clear."
O'Grady,"Well, a lot of young people that we meet in our teaching profession, we don't try to teach them any kind of didactic salvation. But we do try to direct them towards an awareness of what is best and what is most good for them and what is most spiritually nourishing in the world about them, in so far as the system allows us. And I speak of my friend Michael and we here. And the one condition or emotional state—because very frequently the students are not mature enough to be in a spiritual condition, they are in a emotional condition rather than a spiritual one—what we are faced with, is the basic question of ""Who am I?"" ""What is it all about?"" ""Why am I here?"" ""Why should I be here""? ""Who are you, and who the hell are you to tell me what to think or what to read or what not to read? Why should I read Shakespeare? Or why should I read Saint Augustine? Or why should I listen to Mozart? I prefer Bob Dylan,"" and these kind of questions which seem to emanate from a very disillusioned state of mind, an insecurity, an uncertainty, and a lack of credibility in the total structure of things as they are. And so we're frequently faced with not just directly having to answer these questions, as I said didactically answering them by saying in a catechismic sort of way: ""Who am I?"" ""You are..."" ""What am I doing here?"" ""You are doing this here,"" which one can do, of course, also.",Prabhupāda, So...
O'Grady,"And so, rather than present the kind of answers that one could present if one was trained in oneself originally... And one who is first of all trained, then one has to untrain oneself, and then one trains oneself from that experience basically. This is my way of seeing it. And then one tries to help others through this course with the same process. Do you think that we should tell them more directly, or... Well, the basic question is how to handle the problem of modern education.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Our Vedic process is... There are so many questions, as you have already explained. Somebody thinks, ""Why I have come here? And what is the purpose? What you are?"" So many questions. Questions should be answered by the perfect. Therefore the Vedic injunction is tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet: [MU 1.2.12] ""In order to take answers of all these questions one must approach the bona fide spiritual master."""
O'Grady,One must...?,Prabhupāda, Approach the bona fide spiritual master.
Atreya Ṛṣi; O'Grady,"Approach.; The bona fide spiritual master. If you have none, what do you do?",Prabhupāda," No, there is."
O'Grady,"If you are told that Mr. Nixon is the bona fide spiritual master, what do you do?",Prabhupāda," No, we have got standard. Who is bona fide spiritual master? Just like... The one line, you have heard only one line, that bona fide spiritual master, ""You must approach the bona fide spiritual master."" But who is bona fide spiritual master? Then that next question. That is also answered, that bona fide spiritual master means tad -vijñānārtham sa gurum eva abhigacchet, śrotriyaṁ brahma - niṣṭham [MU 1.2.12] . This is the qualification of bona fide spiritual master. What is that? Śrotriyam. Śrotriyam means who has heard from the bona fide spiritual master. A bona fide spiritual master is he who has taken the message from bona fide spiritual master. This is the... Just like a medical man is he who has taken the knowledge of medical science from another medical man."
O'Grady,Just like Christ took this knowledge from the Holy Ghost.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And anyone. Yes. Similarly, bona fide spiritual master means who is in the line of successive spiritual master. The original spiritual master is God. So then one who has heard from God and he has explained the same message to his disciple, then the disciple is bona fide spiritual master—if he does not change. That is our process. We take lessons. We hear from Kṛṣṇa who is the perfect, God. And that is explained in the Bhagavad- gita . Evaṁ paramparā - prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ [Bg. 4.2 ] ."
O'Grady,"But then, you see my poor old father, living in the west of Ireland, a simple man, at his age, seventy now, your generation, he has gotten to the point at his age where he says, ""Well, they tell me, the priests they tell me ultimately it's God who knows. But I want to know who told God.""",Prabhupāda, No.
O'Grady,"And then he comes to me and asks me and says, ""You went to school and you read big books. Tell me who told God."" And so I have no answer.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is the difference between God and me.
O'Grady,That's the difference between being seventy and thirty-nine.,Prabhupāda," No. There is no question of... That is explained in the..., that Bhāgavata , Brahma - sūtra , who is God, first of all. Who is God?"
O'Grady,Who told God?,Prabhupāda," No, no. First of all, ""Who is God?"" Then we shall ask, ""Who told God?"" (chuckles) That God... That is the Vedānta - sūtra , athāto brahma jijñāsā : ""Now we should enquire about God, what is God, who is God."" Unless you know who is God, how can you raise the question, ""Who instructed God?"" If you do not know God, then the question does not arise, ""Who instructed God?"" Is it not? Yes. So therefore God is explained in the Brahma - sūtra , janmādy asya yataḥ : [SB 1.1.1 ] ""God is He from everything comes, emanates."" That is God. That God is explained in the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , janmādy asya yataḥ : [SB 1.1.1 ] ""The Supreme Being from whom everything emanates."" Now, what is that Supreme Being? What is the nature of the Supreme Being? It is a dead stone or a living being? That is also explained. Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ sva - rāṭ [SB 1.1.1 ]. ""That God is fully cognizant of everything, directly and indirectly."" Unless He is fully cognizant of everything, directly and indirectly, He is not God. So then the same question comes, as you said, that ""Who taught God?"""
O'Grady,"Yes, that's the man I want to meet.",Prabhupāda," That is answered, sva - rāṭ . ""Independent."" That is God."
O'Grady,Independ...?,Prabhupāda," Independent. He is fully independent. He does not require to take lessons from anyone. That is God. That is God. If anyone requires to take lesson from other, he is not God. Who does not require to take lesson from other, that is God."
O'Grady,Where does human love enter into it?,Prabhupāda," Everything is there. Because love is also coming from God. So we are being part and parcel of God, there is part and parcel manifestation of love because the original love is there in God. Because nothing can exist. Nothing can exist if it is not in God."
O'Grady,Therefore we love.,Prabhupāda, The love is also there in God.
O'Grady,But God is not love?,Prabhupāda, God is love. God is everything.
O'Grady,"Oh, yeah. Then love is God.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
O'Grady,Our manifestations of love are manifestations of God.,Prabhupāda," Ah... Because we are part and parcel... Just like son born of a particular father, he has got the symptoms, so because there is loving propensity in God and we being part and parcel of God, therefore we have got this loving propensity. This is the conclusion. Unless the loving propensity is there in God, where we get it?"
O'Grady,Maybe it's generated in you by the need...,Prabhupāda," No, there is no question of ""maybe."" It must be, must be."
O'Grady,"Oh, very... Yes, I accept the strong word.",Prabhupāda," Yes. There is no question of... Because we have defined God, janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1 ]. God is He wherefrom everything emanates. That is God. So love, love or even fight. The fighting propensity is also there in God. And loving propensity is also there in God. But His fighting propensity and loving propensity—absolute. Just like in the material world we have got experience, fighting propensity is just opposite the loving propensity. But in God, either fighting propensity or loving propensity, they are one and the same, therefore He is absolute. That is the meaning of absolute. Just like we get from śāstras. The so-called enemies of God who is killed by God, he also attains perfection."
O'Grady,"Yes, the vengeful... Yes, that I understand, the avenging God of Biblical imagination as against... Is it possible to do it all on your own, alone?",Prabhupāda," No. Therefore the Vedas say, tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . Abhigacchet means ""he must."" It is not possible alone. This word, this abhigacchet, this verb, is used in Sanskrit grammar... This is called vidhiliñ form of verb. So vidhiliñ form of verb is used when there is a..., matter is a must. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet, samit - pāṇiḥ śrotriyam. And that is the Vedic version. Therefore... You have read Bhagavad- gītā . You will find Arjuna was talking with Kṛṣṇa . Then, when the things were not solved, perplexed, Arjuna surrendered himself, śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam . Find out this verse."
Nitāi,Nitāi : Text seven.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That... Here is the question, ""confused."""
O'Grady; Nitāi; O'Grady,"I am the first statement. ""I am confused about my duty,"" that what is the... Thank you.; Nitāi : ""...and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am...""; This duty, this duty, is this duty to the self or duty to others or duty to the state?",Prabhupāda," He is confused because he was a kṣatriya , soldier. A soldier's duty is to fight with the enemy. So Kṛṣṇa was advising him, ""The opposite party is your enemy. You are a kṣatriya . Why you are trying to become non-violent? This is not good."" Therefore he says, ""Actually I am now confused. So in confusion I cannot take the right conclusion. I therefore accept You as my spiritual master. You just give me the proper lesson."" This is the point. So they were friends. Still, he was confused. So in chaotic condition, in confusion status of life, we must approach the person who is in full knowledge of the things. Just like you go to a lawyer, you go to a physician; similarly, every one of us in the material world, we are confused. Therefore we must go to the spiritual master who can give us real knowledge."
O'Grady,"Right. So, therefore, for example, I am very confused.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Atreya Ṛṣi; O'Grady,He is confused.; Very confused.,Prabhupāda, Yes. So you must approach a spiritual master.
O'Grady,"And you make a decision, therefore to try to sort this confusion, to make some...",Prabhupāda," Yes. Spiritual master means who solves all confusion. That is spiritual master. When one is confused, he goes to a spiritual master, and the spiritual master's duty is to save him from all confusion. That is the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. If the spiritual master cannot save him from confusion, then he is not spiritual master. That is the test."
O'Grady; Atreya Ṛṣi; O'Grady; Atreya Ṛṣi; O'Grady,"A friend, for example, yes.; A real friend.; Well, if one says he's a friend, that's how he feels. A friend is a friend. There's no question of...; True well-wisher.; There's no question of being half-real friend or unreal friend. A friend is a friend.",Prabhupāda," Yes, the best friend is the spiritual master because he saves from the blazing fire of confusion. That is best friend."
O'Grady,The problem is to find this friend. The problem is to find this spiritual master.,Prabhupāda," No, there is no problem. The problem is if you are sincere. Yes. That is stated. Because actually you have got problems, but God is within your heart. Īśvaraḥ sarva - bhūtānāṁ hṛd - deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61 ]. God is not far away. God is within your heart. So if you are sincere, then God will give you spiritual master. If He knows that now you are sincere, then He will give you a spiritual master."
O'Grady,O.K. Thank you. That I know.,Prabhupāda," Therefore God is called caittya - guru , the spiritual master within the heart. And the physical spiritual master is God's mercy. If God sees that you are sincere, He will give you a spiritual master who can give you protection. He will help you from within and without, without in the physical form of spiritual master, and within as the spiritual master within the heart. That is stated,"
