Gurudāsa; Guest (1) (Indian man),"Guru dāsa : I think it is direct. That I can do.; (Hindi with Prabhupāda) In relation with our business also, I am thinking of going.",Prabhupāda, No business. (laughter) Don't go. Business is this hari kīrtana .
Guest (1),(Hindi) I just said that I had thought of that in my own different way also.,Prabhupāda, (Hindi)
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : People carry on business for happiness and enough to eat and enough clothing. That, no separate endeavor is necessary. Kṛṣṇa gives it all, and more happiness.

I am still at the lower level and struggling against those things.; Guru dāsa : Only advanced because I'm putting more time in. Otherwise, not more advanced.; Yeah. Capacity has improved. Our capacity is still limited. We are still embroiled in the...; Guru dāsa : Advanced means such and such a person has spent so many times in the business house, twenty-five years, he gets a gold watch.

Guest (3),(Sanskrit) bhijāyate.,Prabhupāda," So I have seen this instrument. Destiny is very strong. Karmaṇā daiva - netreṇa jantur deha upapattaye [SB 3.31.1 ] . Therefore śāstra says that you try for that thing which was not possible in many other lives. In each life everyone gets father, mother, son, and the father's duty to son, son, that is going on. When you take birth as demigod- Indra , Candra , Varuṇa —or as human being or as animal the care-taking business is there. Even the small ant during rainy season, when there is so much flood, they take the eggs on the head—you have seen the red ant?—and finding out some place. The care-taking is there. Even the birds, a sparrow. So when their, the season for laying down eggs, they bring some straws, and keep like that to make a nest for taking care of the eggs. So this taking care by the father and mother, beginning from the ant up to the Indra , Candra devas , that is there."

Guest (1),"...through loving the form of God... It has form and yet it's formless. It's both..., has form and formless.",Prabhupāda," What is that formlessness, and what is that form?"
Guest (1),That I can't say. What do I know about these things? My own knowledge is just very slight.,Prabhupāda," You are not learning there, where you are staying?"
Guest (1),"I'm learning. I'm learning love. It's, Mahārāja ..., this Nim Karoli Baba, has told us that love, love of God is the highest.",Prabhupāda," But love, if you have no form where to love? The air?"
Guest (1),"You love the form, it's true. You have bhakti , you love the form of God.",Prabhupāda, But you said it's formless.
Guest (1),"Ah, yes. Well, it's, uh, that, I've read the...",Prabhupāda," How it is? How, if is formless, how you can love, enjoy?"
Guest (1),"You can't love the formless, it's true.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Fictitious love. Why don't you ask this intelligent question? If you say formless, then where is the love?"
Guest (1),"He doesn't teach the formless. That was my own view, but that is not anything that he's ever taught me.",Prabhupāda, What does he teach?
Guest (1),He said...,Prabhupāda, He teaches form?
Guest (1),He says that... Yes. He is a great bhakta of Hanumānji.,Prabhupāda, Who is Hanumān ?
Guest (1),Hanumān is the breath of Rāma .,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guest (1),"The breath of Rāma , svasa . Rāma - ke - svasa , breath of Rāma .",Prabhupāda, Breath?
Guest (1),"The breath. Hanumān was the... Rāma , Rāma once asked Hanumān , ""What do you see? How do you see Me?'' and Hanumān answered, ""When I know who I am, You and I are one, and when I forget who I am, then I serve you.""",Prabhupāda, That's so nonsense.
Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1),"Nonsense? Well, perhaps that's true. I don't know...; Guru dāsa : When you remember who you are you serve, and when you forget who you are, you think you're one with God. Just like suppose you sat in Nam Karoli's chair, just forgetting who you are, that his chela, his disciple, I'm Nam Karoli.; Nim Karoli.; Guru dāsa : Nim Karoli. Sorry. Similarly, when we forget who we are, we think we're one with God, but when we remember, we're His bhakta , we're His servant.; Yes, that's also true. It's a fact.; Guru dāsa : When Hanumān , he's a great bhakta . We should follow in his footsteps. ""One who says he is My devotee, he is not My devotee. One who says he is a devotee of My devotee, he is My devotee.'' Very humble. Then we can make advancement [ Cc. Madhya 13.80 ].; Mahārāja is teaching—you asked his teaching—these things are the same really, I, things that he's told me. But he said that the whole universe was God, and that you should never hurt anyone, that you should serve...",Prabhupāda, How you can serve whole universe?
Guest (1),I beg your pardon.,Prabhupāda, How you can serve whole universe?
Guest (1),How can you serve the whole universe?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),You love the beings that you find yourself...,Prabhupāda, You love? To whom you love?
Guest (1),Whoever you're with.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guest (1),"Whatever, whatever...",Prabhupāda, That is... Suppose you love me. You love the whole universe? Why this false impression?
Guest (1),Well certainly every being in the universe is a part of me.,Prabhupāda, (indistinct). You can place your love to a particular person or particular community.
Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Does it mean you love the whole universe?
Guest (1),No.,Prabhupāda," Just like, just like nationalism. You are American?"
Guest (1,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So you have got your nationality. You love your country. But why you kill cows? Is that love of universe?
Guest (1),If I love America?,Prabhupāda," Yes. You love your men, but you kill your cows."
Guest (1),Acchā .,Prabhupāda, Why?
Guest (1),Through ignorance. Men...,Prabhupāda," Then how you love the whole universe, if you are in ignorance?"
Guest (1),You do your best.,Prabhupāda," If you are ignorant, you do not know how to love."
Guest (1),"That's true, of course. Ignorance is...",Prabhupāda," Then how do you speak of universal love? When you do not know how to love, how do you speak universe, big, big word. You do not know the art of love, and you are speaking universal love."
Guest (1),"Well, certainly every...",Prabhupāda," That is ignorance. First of all you say that you do not know how to love, and you are speaking of love the universe. It has already..."
Guest (1),Certainly each being in the universe is a part of the universe...,Prabhupāda, But you cannot love each being. That is my point.
Devotee,They were hinting at it. She was saying if you love a pure being...,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guest (1); Devotee,"You love the universe. Like you asked if I loved the universe.; She said that if you love a pure being, then you can love the universe. She stated that if you love a pure being then you can love the universe.",Prabhupāda, Then there is impure being and pure being?
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Is it a fact?
Devotee,Is that true?,Prabhupāda," Then as soon as you say pure being, there is impure being."
Guest (1); Guest (3),It seems that way.; The soul isn't impure.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guest (3); Guest (1),The soul isn't impure. That's the only reality-purity of the soul.; You love God.,Prabhupāda," Purity of the soul, that means there are impurity of the soul."
Guest (1),It seems that way. It seems that there is...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),...to my eyes.,Prabhupāda, Then you have to distinguish which is impure and which is pure.
Guest (1); Guest (3),That's very difficult.; I don't know what your saying.,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Guest (3); Guest (1),That there can be an impurity of the soul?; He was asking...,Prabhupāda," You said. You said purity of the soul. That means there must be the contradictory: impurity of soul. Then now we have to distinguish which is impure, which is pure."
Devotee; Guest (1),"How can we distinguish?; In the absolute sense the soul is always pure, there is no impurity. But when man is in ignorance, as māyā ... Śrī Kṛṣṇa's yogamāyā , His power of delusion, He can...., He makes you think, He makes you see impurity. You see suffering in the world.",Prabhupāda, So wherefrom the māyā comes?
Guest (1); Gurudāsa,"From... I don't know, I can't answer that. It's, it's, it's God's nature, it's His līlā .; Guru dāsa : You stated that Kṛṣṇa makes us see impurity. Is this correct Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, (indistinct)
Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : That Śrī Kṛṣṇa , Lord Kṛṣṇa makes us see impurity. He mentioned...; When a man is in ignorance.; Guru dāsa : Well which is first?; Which is first? Which, ignorance or what?; Guru dāsa : Does Kṛṣṇa make us in ignorance?; Well, He creates the whole universe and everything in it.; Guru dāsa : Yes. Śrīla Prabhupāda maybe you can explain that.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Does Kṛṣṇa makes us ignorant or are we ignorant?,Prabhupāda, We are.
Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Yes.; We are.; Guru dāsa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," As he said, when you forget, you are in ignorance."
Guest (1); Gurudāsa,Yes.; Guru dāsa : Can you explain that a little bit more for us?,Prabhupāda, He has already said. This forgetfulness is ignorance.
Guest (1),"Yes, forgetfulness.",Prabhupāda, He knows that.
Guest (1),"The sense of egoism, I and me and mine is ignorance. It's forgetting that God is everything and that you are nothing.",Prabhupāda," That God and you are different, because you forget God, (indistinct)."
Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1),"Guru dāsa : (indistinct) .... and we forget, so they must be different. We're impure and He's pure, so we're different.; Actually that's the best attitude.; Guru dāsa : So to understand how we're different means we're in knowledge, not ignorance. And then what to do with that understanding means that not seeming. You said it seems, but we're saying not seems...; That's because my, I've read some other things, some other types of thoughts. Now...",Prabhupāda," Now, (indistinct), the universe is God, then you are also God. Is it?"
Guest (1),"Yes, that follows.",Prabhupāda," Then, how you become ignorant?"
Guest (1),That's a mystery. That's something I can't explain.,Prabhupāda, Everything is mystery.
Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Śyāmasundara; Guest (1); Gurudāsa,"Is that your... Is that a mystery?; Guru dāsa : No.; You understand. Well, that's good.; Guru dāsa : (indistinct). Śrīla Prabhupāda. He has made us, oṁ ajñāna timirāndasya, that by the torchlight of knowledge, he has opened my eyes. There's one Sanskrit poem,; Everything is a mystery, but if someone who knows that mystery tells you the answer then you can know, then it ceases to be a mystery. But you can't find out on your own.; No, you can't.; Guru dāsa : Prabhupāda was the other day saying that we're the, we have the science of love of God. Many people say, the material scientists say perhaps or about 5,000 years ago such and such happened, but we say 485 years ago Lord Caitanya came. Five thousand years ago such and such happened. There are 8,400,000 species of life, not perhaps there are 8,400,000. So, this is very scientific, this relationship.",Prabhupāda," This is very difficult for the Māyāvādī philosophers to answer, that everyone is God but when God becomes ignorant? And what kind of God He is that He forgets and becomes ignorant? In māyā . So māyā becomes better than God? Is it not? Then what is the definition of God? So many things. But they cannot answer. Just like you said that when you become ignorant (indistinct) God, how it happens? (indistinct). God, how God can be ignorant? And how can God become forgetful? It is contradictory. Then what kind of God he is, that he becomes ignorant sometimes?"
Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1); Gurudāsa; Guest (1),"Guru dāsa : And if it's Kṛṣṇa's yogamāyā that makes us forgetful and makes God forgetful, that means Kṛṣṇa's God.; No, no, He's the Lord of māyā . He, Kṛṣṇa's pure.; Guru dāsa : Kṛṣṇa's the Lord of everything.; Yes, of course. Kṛṣṇa never forgets.; Guru dāsa : Māyā's also Kṛṣṇa's servant.; Yes, of course.",Prabhupāda," Now (indistinct) That's right. If Kṛṣṇa does not forget, then Kṛṣṇa is God, isn't it?"
Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then why not take Kṛṣṇa līlā study? Why go to others?
Guest (1),"Well, I have. I try to the best of my ability, I've read the Gītā , the Bhāgavata .",Prabhupāda," What Kṛṣṇa says, what Kṛṣṇa says, if Kṛṣṇa is God and Kṛṣṇa is never forgetful, then why not go to Kṛṣṇa ?"
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : He says he's read the Gītā and the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . So what has come?,Prabhupāda," Reading is not, I mean to say..."
Guest (1),"Of course not, reading is very (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," ...to understand Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa says mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. 7.7 ] , there is no more greater truth than Me. Bhoktāraṁ yajña - tapasāṁ sarva - loka - maheśvaram [Bg. 5.29 ], I am the Lord of all the planetary systems, sarva - loka . So why should you go to others if you think that Kṛṣṇa is God, there is no greater personality than Kṛṣṇa ? Take the instruction from Kṛṣṇa . It is very easy."
Guest (1),Where is Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda, Huh ? To take instruction from Kṛṣṇa .
Guest (1),Of course. As much as He allows me.,Prabhupāda," So, He allows everything. What is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ], you give up everything just surrender unto Me. So if you surrender (indistinct), but if you don't that is your business."
Guest (1),How does one surrender?,Prabhupāda," That is another thing. You do not know then, you have to learn who I will surrender, but the position is this, Kṛṣṇa says that you surrender unto Me. You can surrender immediately. Surrender means just like in war field there is surrender: ""(indistinct) now. Now sir, you surrender. Now whatever you like you can do."" That is surrender. ""If you like, kill me, and if you like, keep(?) me. That is surrender. It is very simple thing. In the war field when other party is defeated, the holds the hand, surrender. That means ""If you like kill me, I throw down my weapon. If you like, save me."" So He is the Supreme. If He likes He can kill me, if He likes He can save me, so I am subordinate. How can, I can do equally Kṛṣṇa ? As soon as you surrender, it is accepted that you are predominated and He is predominator. So how you, the predominated, can be equal to the predominator?"
Devotee; Guest (1),Can't be.; He is the Lord (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Śyāmasundara; Guest (1),"The thing you said when you came in was that we merge with something which is formless beyond Kṛṣṇa , the first...; No, it's not beyond Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," If he has read Bhagavad- gītā , that he cannot say, because Kṛṣṇa says brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā , I am the resort of Brahman . So He is greater than Brahman . Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate , even Brahman emanates from Me, and actually it is so. Just like the sunshine (indistinct) sun globe. Although the sunshine is universe(?), but still dependent on the sun globe."
Guest (1),"Of course that's true. There's nothing beyond Kṛṣṇa , of course.",Prabhupāda, That's good(?).
Devotee; Guest (1),Very nice (indistinct).; (indistinct),Prabhupāda, Very good. He's(?) good boy.
Śyāmasundara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have a question.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Śyāmasundara,If unity means to agree in purpose.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara,Then what is that purpose? What is Kṛṣṇa's purpose?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa is living force. He has got different purpose."
Śyāmasundara,Oh.,Prabhupāda," Don't say that Kṛṣṇa has only one purpose, that only purpose is that you surrender. Now, when you surrender, whatever Kṛṣṇa says you do it."
Śyāmasundara,Oh. So His purpose is individual for everyone.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Varieties of purposes. Kṛṣṇa is asking Arjuna to fight with the Kurus, or He's asking me to preach. I am not fighting. So Kṛṣṇa , (indistinct), He has got varieties of order, and your duty is to carry out the order of Kṛṣṇa , that's all. What kind of order He'll give, you accept, just like you are doing, all my disciples. It is not that you are all doing the same thing. Somebody is pūjārī , somebody is preaching, somebody is collector, somebody is (indistinct), somebody is this, somebody is that. So there are different varieties, but your duty is to carry out my order."
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : Just like you're satisfying us all, Kṛṣṇa satisfies everyone, (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," Surrender means, whatever is favorable for Kṛṣṇa we apply, that's all. You cannot say, just like Arjuna , he first of all declined, ""Kṛṣṇa, I am not going to fight.'' That is not surrender."
Guest (1),"""I'll do whatever you want, but don't ask me to fight.""",Prabhupāda," You cannot deny Him. That is surrender. Then, when he understood Bhagavad- gītā he said ""Yes, I shall do that.'' So long I deny Kṛṣṇa that is disunity, and as soon as I agree, ""Kṛṣṇa, yes.'' Then this unity. Unity does not mean that Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna become united, homogeneous. No. Kṛṣṇa is distinct and Arjuna . They continue to exist. In the beginning Arjuna was denying to fight. That is dependence(?), and at the end when he said, ""Yes, kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [Bg. 18.73 ], my illusion is now over. That is (indistinct). Unity does not mean one's self loses individuality. That is cannot, that cannot be. Kṛṣṇa says that ""both you and me and all these soldiers and Kings they existed before, now we are existing and we shall exist in future(?). So, that individuality is always kept. So unity means agreeing with the order of Kṛṣṇa , and disunity means not agreeing with the order. Otherwise your existence(?), mine and Kṛṣṇa's existence, always will be."
Śyāmasundara,"Sometimes people ask what is, what is God's ultimate goal? What is, why is God creating everything and are all these manifestations...",Prabhupāda," These are very old questions. These are not very intelligent questions. God is not creating. God is giving you chance. The conditioned souls who are not with Kṛṣṇa , they wanted to enjoy this material world. Therefore God is giving them chance. ""All right enjoy (indistinct),'' and giving instruction also that you enjoy in this way, so that you may come back again. Just like a father. Children wants to play in the (indistinct). ""All right, you play.'' Then, as soon as he asks, ""Please come back. (indistinct), they come back. Similarly this material world, we wanted to enjoy, so Kṛṣṇa has given us freedom, ""All right enjoy"". And now Kṛṣṇa gives instruction that ""now you give up all this (indistinct) come back, then you (indistinct).'' He created for you. Same example I always give. Just like the government, when there is formation of the city, jail construction is also there. You cannot say that, ""Why government is creating, it is unnecessary, it's premature, construction of jail work(?). But the government knows that there are some criminals who has to be put into the jail. Therefore the jail created. So because there are criminals, therefore government creates. Similarly, there are many conditioned souls who, instead of serving Kṛṣṇa , they want to enjoy. ""All right, for you, you enjoy to your fullest extent.'' And when he is tired of enjoying, enjoying, enjoying. Then Kṛṣṇa says that, ""If you give up all this nonsense, just surrender to Me, you will be accepted.'' But the demons will never surrender to Kṛṣṇa . They say that this material world is false and Brahman is truth, but they do not know how to act as Brahman . Brahman means to stop. That is nirviśeṣavāda and śūnyavāda , to become void. But you cannot become void. If I say ""Mr. such and such, you sit down here, try to become void,'' how long you shall do that, void?"
Guest (1),"No, that's impossible.",Prabhupāda," That's impossible. So this is a wrong theory. Because I am a living entity, I have got my activities. I can remain void for few seconds, for few minutes. (Guests enter and pay obeisances) Very glad to see you. (indistinct—break)"
Dr. Kapoor,"As I understand (indistinct). The export minister (indistinct). (indistinct) C. D. Gupta , the old chief minister, you see.

Gupta is coming to see the temple at 4 o'clock. I don't know. At any rate I may be wrong. It's (indistinct) you see. They shouldn't make the two programs coincide.

Dr. Kapoor,"Yes, because you are just an instrument (laughter).",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor,"You are just an instrument, you see.",Prabhupāda," Just like Kavirāja Gosvāmī also writes that I do not know how things are coming, but with my hand is getting written. It is something like that."
Dr. Kapoor,"Yes, yes. It cannot be, cannot but be (indistinct).",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. Even by his consciousness it acts faultlessly.
Dr. Kapoor,It acts immediately.,Prabhupāda, Yes.

Dr. Kapoor,Ahaituki . Hmm.,Prabhupāda," Jñāna - vairāgya , janayaty āśu , ahaituki . Nobody knows how we do."
Dr. Kapoor,That's true.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Kapoor; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"That's true. But the wonder is that it didn't act so far, you see, it didn't act when Bon Mahārāja went up. It didn't act when a proper program, and a number of other people, you see. It has started acting only now, (laughter).; Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Hmm.

Dr. Kapoor,Huh .,Prabhupāda, So that Bhagavad- gītā as it is published by MacMillan Company.
Dr. Kapoor,"I haven't read it through, but I saw the publication.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So they are having every year one edition.

Dr. Kapoor,"It's nectar, really.",Prabhupāda," Doctor Kapoor, what is your age now? I think you are a little younger than me."

When I came back in 1967, that was spent as my taxi fare (laughter). At that time it was spent. From Palam airport to Delhi, that Chippiwada. So they charged me thirty-five rupees or forty rupees. So at that time it was spent, and 1967 there was heart attack."

Dr. Kapoor,So it was after the heart attack that you came here?,Prabhupāda," Yes. At that time. Then there was repeated letters, come back, come back. So I returned in 1968. So, in spite of heart weakness, I worked. I suffered that weakness continually for one year."
Dr. Kapoor,"Naturally, naturally.",Prabhupāda," Then I was taking Kavirāja's medicine. I took it from here, that Yogendranātha. That gave me good strength, and massage the body. Not taking bath in cold water. In this way, somehow or other, still going on."

Dr. Kapoor,Oh.,Prabhupāda," It was hundred and twenty-five dollars. And I got opportunity, also, the same building, one small apartment, seventy-two dollars, or seventy dollars, no seventy-five, seventy-five. In this way, two-hundred dollars per month. So I had only two-hundred dollars, I immediately advanced and took the risk of two-hundred dollars."
Devotee,That was a year after you went.,Prabhupāda," Yes. In 1966. I went there in 1965. So, then..."

Dr. Kapoor; Gurudāsa,I see.; Guru dāsa : We should let Dr. Karan Singh patronize ...,Prabhupāda, Huh ?

Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Because there is so much demand. He wants to see it. He wants to see it.,Prabhupāda," So why don't you get the manuscript and let us have an Indian edition. I told Rūpānuga that the difficulty is that the enlarged edition when we are attempting to publish, MacMillan says that ""We are publishing your book, why not we, we publish.'' If we publish, then we save our investment to publish. That has not been decided, so therefore I advised my secretary in New York that MacMillan's permission or no permission, you should immediately print. If they print it is all right, otherwise print ourself."
Dr. Kapoor,Haven't you given the copyright to them?,Prabhupāda," No, copyright is mine."
Dr. Kapoor; Guest (5),"Oh.; Can you get, get it, published in India.",Prabhupāda," In India, yes. No, by publisher, especially publisher like MacMillan you save so much time and investment also. We are not for profit. We want to see the publication in the market, so in that sense we save so much trouble, but they always look after their business profit."
Dr. Kapoor,Naturally.,Prabhupāda," In the beginning also I requested them to publish the whole, but they said, ""No, it will be very big, it will be costly. You reduce it to 400 pages.'' So that 1100 pages were reduced to 400 pages. Now when people are demanding this Bhagavad- gītā As It Is, people are coming. When our saṅkīrtana party goes in the street many gentlemen comes and demands ""Have you got Bhaktivedanta's Bhagavad- gītā As It Is?"""
Dr. Kapoor,"Hm, yes.",Prabhupāda," Yes, they demand it. In every center it is going on very nicely. Then we have many customer requested the enlarged edition. So, so everything is ready. Now this controversy, whether MacMillan will publish or we shall publish."
Dr. Kapoor,There is no doubt that you will be saving a lot of trouble (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, And they have got good organization.
Dr. Kapoor,Good organization they have got.,Prabhupāda, All over the world.
Dr. Kapoor,They'll sell more. They'll sell more.,Prabhupāda," Actually because it was published by MacMillan Company, it has become widely circulated, people are demanding."
Dr. Kapoor,I think you should let them publish.,Prabhupāda," That I am trying, but it has not been decided, but anyway it will be published very soon."
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : Even if they do publish it, they will not distribute it in India.",Prabhupāda," Yes, in that sense we may publish in India."
Dr. Kapoor,"You may have an agreement with them, that you have a cheaper Indian edition, which you will sell only in India, you can give them the right to sell it all over the world.",Prabhupāda," I have asked that Shishu Kumar, Shishu Kumar you know?"
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : No.,Prabhupāda, The Atmarama & Son's proprietor.
Gurudāsa,"Guru dāsa : Oh yes, yes.",Prabhupāda, He came to see me.
