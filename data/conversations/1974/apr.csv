Akṣara means, ""that does not fall down."" That is akṣara . Akṣara and kṣara . The spiritual world is akṣara , and this material world is kṣara . So the living entities or God in the spiritual world, they are all akṣara . And in the material world we are all kṣara . Therefore akṣaram paramaṁ brahma . The Supreme..."
Chandobhai,Svabhāvo 'dhyātmam.,Prabhupāda, Svabhāvam .

Chandobhai,Mentally. Spiritually... Inner existence.,Prabhupāda," No. Adhyātmam . Adhyātma . Ātma means body, mind and the soul, but here adhyātma means the body and the mind. That is material nature. The body and mind is made of material nature. [break] ...creation."
Chandobhai,"Creation, yes.",Prabhupāda," So by working with the body, we create another creation."
Dr. Patel,Bhūta -bhāvodbhava...,Prabhupāda," Just like now I am a human being. Next life I may be a demigod, I may be a dog. That I create. That is sarga ."
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,That is karma .; That is his karma . That is his karma .; What is karma ?,Prabhupāda," Karma , anyone can understand. As you... Fruitive activities. You do something and enjoy the good or bad result. That is karma . You do something, either good or bad. So the result you'll have to suffer or enjoy."
Dr. Patel,"But here is a very big question. I'm very sorry to... Who does the karma ? Unless and until we have got ahaṅkāra in that, then...",Prabhupāda," The ahaṅkāra is there, false ahaṅkāra . You are thinking that ""I am kṣatriya . "" That is false ahaṅkāra ."
Dr. Patel,"That is what I said. So doer is that, ahaṅkāra is the doer.",Prabhupāda, That ahaṅkāra ...
Dr. Patel,Then it is karma . Not otherwise.,Prabhupāda," As soon as you come to the material world, the ahaṅkāra is there, that ""I... I belong to India."" ""I belong to America."" ""I belong to brāhmaṇa community, kṣatriya ... "" The ahaṅkāra is there. Ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā. So long this ahaṅkāra is there, ""I am this, I am that,"" all bodily concept..."
Chandobhai,Ahaṅkāra -vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. 3.27 ] .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,But this karma . Here is the question of karma .,Prabhupāda," The karma ... Karma means he is doing, but every, everyone is doing in his own way. Nobody, nobody cares to understand the instruction of Kṛṣṇa . Everyone is doing in his own way. That is karma ."
Dr. Patel,Kiṁ karma kim akarmeti kavayo...,Prabhupāda," Ah, that will be explained. Karma , akarma , yes. [break] ...the same, material. Kṣara . Kṣara bhāvaḥ . That is perishable."
Chandobhai,Perishable.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,Puruṣaś cādhidaivatam.,Prabhupāda, Puruṣa . Puruṣa means the soul.
Chandobhai,Soul. Jīva .,Prabhupāda," Yes, the jīva . Puruṣa adhidaivatam . Then?"

Chandobhai,"No, no. Adhidaiva, puruṣa .",Prabhupāda," Adhidaiva, jīva . Adhiyajña , Paramātmā ."
Dr. Patel,That is what I said.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,Adhiyajña is... [break],Prabhupāda, Karma means which produces result. And akarma means which does not produce result. So that they do not know.
Chandobhai,And the vikarma .,Prabhupāda," Just like these activities, devotional service, it does not produce any result. And the ordinary man... Suppose they are also selling books. An ordinary man also selling books. It appears to be the same. But they are not creating any result. But ordinary bookseller, he's creating his result, pāpa - puṇya . That is karma and akarma . And vikarma . Vikarma means against the..."
Chandobhai,Vikṛta karma .,Prabhupāda," Yes, vikṛta ."
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,"Vikṛta , against śāstra .; Although the actions which are prohibitory...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Dr. Patel,"...and if we do it, it is vikarma .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,"Adhiyajño 'ham evātra dehe deha - bhṛtāṁ vara . Īśvara, īśvara .",Prabhupāda, Īśvara.
Dr. Patel,That means īśvaraḥ sarva - bhūtānāṁ ... [Bg. 18.61 ]. [break],Prabhupāda," ...important thing, mām , Kṛṣṇa . They practice it, always remembering Kṛṣṇa . Then at the end of life, ante nārāyaṇa - smṛti . That is perfection of life. But how one will remember, ante , then? There is a verse of... Just wait."
Chandobhai,Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran ... [Bg. 8.6 ].,Prabhupāda," No. Just wait. There is a verse by Kulaśekhara. Kulaśekhara. Adyaiva viśatu me mānasa - rāja - haṁsaḥ . He says. He says, ""My Lord..."" The idea is that ""Now I am in quite fit order. So let me remember You and die. Because at the end of... At the end of... Kapha - pitta - vāyu , there will be disorder. Smaraṇaṁ kutas te [ MM 33] . At that time, it is..."""
Dr. Patel,How can there be the smaran ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Therefore, my Lord, I pray that adyaiva, immediately, because now I am fit."""
Dr. Patel,Right now.,Prabhupāda," Right now. ""Now I am fit. So let me remember You and die."" So one must be fit. You see, even in daily, in dream, while sleeping, we forget so many things. Everything we forget."
Chandobhai,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So at the time of death, when everything is disordered, nothing is in order, unless one is very strongly practiced, how he can remember?"
Dr. Patel,"My father spoke, ""Oṁ, "" and he stopped breathing and...",Prabhupāda," That's nice. Oṁ , oṁ ity eka ... That is..."
Dr. Patel,Then he stopped breathing.,Prabhupāda," That means he practiced. Therefore, either you practice Oṁ or Hare Kṛṣṇa , that is all right."
Dr. Patel,"Whatever we do of our whole, all our whole, all day of life, it comes at the end. That is why you must continue to do for the life.",Prabhupāda," Twenty-four hours. Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ [ Cc. Ādi 17.31 ] . Always Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa ... In this way practicing, if somebody is fortunate enough, he can remember."
Dr. Patel,Eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha na ... Sthitvā samanta - kāle 'pi brahma - nirvāṇam ṛcchati .,Prabhupāda, So...
Dr. Patel,"Therefore at the last moment you... But you can't get that last moment in this position because you have, whole life, you have...",Prabhupāda," Yes, you have spoiled your life simply in material activities. How you can remember?"
Dr. Patel,"But even if you are doing material activities by your body, and by your mental activities you are bhaja kṛṣṇa ...",Prabhupāda," But you are under the body... Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. 3.27 ] . Body and mind is working... Unless you practice to be above body and mind... That is bhakti - yoga . Māṁ cāvyabhicāriṇi- bhakti - yoga ..., sa guṇān samatītya . You cannot expect that you go on doing all these material activities and at the time of death you'll remember Kṛṣṇa . That is not possible."
Dr. Patel,That can't be done.,Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
Chandobhai,Should be a real concentrated difference,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,"When you do the work, you should be a real concentration.",Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
Chandobhai,Therefore there is no... Because your attachment is more to the...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,...reserves of that...,Prabhupāda, Vīta - rāga - bhaya - krodhā man- mayā ... [Bg. 4.10 ].
Chandobhai,Mad - bhaktaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Man- mayā mad - aśritāḥ . Unless he takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa , these things are not possible. Simply by talking it is not possible. There must be practice."
Chandobhai,Acaropanam. (?),Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,(Sanskrit); Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaram bhāvaṁ tyajanty ante ... [break],Prabhupāda," There is a risk. Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi . If you are thinking of dog, then you become a dog."
Dr. Patel,Just as Bhārata did it.,Prabhupāda," Yes. yes, that is example. Even Bhārata Mahārāja , such a great personality, simply due to little affection to a cub of deer, he became a deer. So these people are attached to so many things. So how much risk is there at the time of death they do not understand. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, mām ekam ."
Chandobhai,Tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu mām eva ... [Bg. 8.7 ].,Prabhupāda, Mām ekam : Then you...
Dr. Patel,"Therefore every time, every moment...",Prabhupāda, That is... This is stressed. If you...
Dr. Patel,Mām smarata yudhya ca .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Yudhya means ""do your activity.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. But always think. Just like these people are, these, they are doing that. They are doing their duty. Somebody's going to there, somebody's going there, somebody's there... But their chanting is there. That is not avoided. That is not avoided. Sadā tad bhāva - bhāvitaḥ [Bg. 8.6 ] . Then Kṛṣṇa favors, ""Yes, he has done his best."""
Chandobhai,Tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu ... [ Bg. 8.7 ].,Prabhupāda, Ah!
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,Yudhya ca . Yudhya ca .; Mayy arpita - mano buddhir mām evaiśyasy asaṁśayaḥ [Bg. 8.7 ] .,Prabhupāda," Ah! Asaṁśayaḥ . Because his mind is in Kṛṣṇa , it doesn't matter he's fighting. Fighting is superfluous. Real thing is mind is in Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,That is bhramara - nyāya .,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,"Bhramara - nyāya . Because the small ant... [break]; ...nānya- gāminā .; Abhyāsa - yoga , by... We explained that...",Prabhupāda," One... Abhyāsa - yoga ... You practice this. Therefore we say, ""You must chant at least sixteen rounds."" This is abhyāsa - yoga . When one becomes attached to chanting, he doesn't require to be under discipline. But so long he's not practiced, he must be under... Just like a boy. He's instructed by the teacher, ""You must give me at least four pages handwriting."" So four pages handwriting means writing, writing, he'll be practiced. So therefore these are the practice. You must..."
Chandobhai,Nānya- gāminā .,Prabhupāda," Nānya- gāminā . Because cetāḥ , mind is very flickering. So unless you fix up your mind under some regulative principles, then it is not possible. (indistinct) Everyone becomes paramahaṁsa : ""Oh, I am now advanced. I do not require all these regulative principles."""
Dr. Patel,What is paramahaṁsa ?,Prabhupāda, Paramahaṁsa means he's above. Paramo nirmatsarānām [SB 1.1.2 ] . That is paramahaṁsa .
Chandobhai,Paramaṁ puruṣaṁ divyaṁ yāti pārthānucintayan.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Paramaṁ puruṣaṁ divyaṁ yāti .
Dr. Patel,Pārthānucintayan. By thinking about... [break],Prabhupāda," Smartavyaḥ satato viṣṇuḥ . Therefore one has to think of Viṣṇu always, twenty-four hours, in so many ways."
Chandobhai,Kaviṁ purāṇam anuśāsitāram .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,"Aṇor aṇīyān anusmared yaḥ , sarvasya dhātāram acintya - rūpam ...",Prabhupāda, This is the description of the param .
Chandobhai,Āditya- varṇaṁ tamasaḥ parastāt . Prayāṇa - kāle manasācalena...,Prabhupāda, [break] ... varṇa . That is... Āditya- varṇa means self-effulgent. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad- aṇḍa - koṭi [Bs. 5.40] . That is āditya - varṇa . Āditya is never in darkness.
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,Prayāṇa - kāle manasācalena...; Prayāṇa - kāle manasācalena. Acalena .,Prabhupāda," Again... Acalena . Acalena means he has been practiced to fix his mind to Kṛṣṇa . Then, if he's successful, the prayāṇa - kāle , he must remember."
Chandobhai,"Yes, yes. Here. Bhaktyā yukto yoga - balena caiva.",Prabhupāda, Yoga . Bhaktya . That is the bhakti - yoga . Not otherwise.
Chandobhai,Bhruvor madhye prāṇam āveśya samyak .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...they meditate all the life, the so-called yogis. Something impersonal... Some light, like this, like that. Light may be also, if that Brahmān light. But here it is specifically mentioned..."
Dr. Patel,Especially spontaneously you feel some light...,Prabhupāda," That's all right, Brahma -light. But the Brahma -light, according to Bhāgavata philosophy, even one enters in the Brahman effulgence, still he falls down. Still he falls down. Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādhṛta-yusmad- aṅghrayaḥ [SB 10.2.32 ] . Unless one is fixed up in the personal form of the Lord, there is chance of falling down. They fall down actually. We have seen so many sannyāsīs. Just like at the present moment, Korpatali(?). He's now busy in politics."
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,"One man married in America, some sannyāsī .; Citrabhānu, Citrabhānu.; Citrabhānu, or... [break]",Prabhupāda, ...one is God.
Bhāgavata; Chandobhai; Bhāgavata; Chandobhai,"Bhāgavata : Citrabhānu.; Citrabhānu, yes.; Bhāgavata : Brahmānanda Swami met him in Mombassa, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he was speaking all this nonsense. Then he went to America... [break]; ...icchanto brahmacaryaṁ caranti .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,Tat te padaṁ saṅgraheṇa pravakṣye . Now He will tell us in saṅgraha ...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,...that padam .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,That is Goloka dhāma .,Prabhupāda, That is Kṛṣṇa . Yes. Yad akṣaraṁ veda -vido vadanti . That means impersonal. Veda -vido. One who knows Vedas.
Chandobhai,Viśanti yad yatayo vīta - rāgāḥ .,Prabhupāda, Then?
Chandobhai,"You see, now He tells all the practice of the yoga .",Prabhupāda," Yes, that's... Artificially you cannot saṁyama . If your mind is not fixed-up, artificially you cannot make. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad gata ... [Bg. 6.47 ]. One who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa , he is perfect yogi ."
Chandobhai,"But he has to be yogi at that time, isn't it?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Sarva - dvārāṇi saṁyamya . Just like these boys, they do not go to see cinema, they do not go to restaurant. This is sarva - dvārāṇi saṁyamya . You see? They do not go to anywhere except in the temple. They do not talk anything nonsense, except Kṛṣṇa . This is sarva - dvārāṇi saṁyamya ."
Dr. Patel,They should not talk anything else except Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Vacaṁsi vaikuṇṭha -guṇānuvarṇane. So this is sam ... Unless you give engagement to the senses, proper, how you can control it? Your eyes want to see beautiful of man or woman. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa . But when you are captivated by seeing the Deity of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā , then that eyes being engaged otherwise is stopped. That has been explained by Prabhodānanda Sarasvatī . Durdantendriya- kāla - sarpa -paṭalī-protkhāta-daṁstrāyate. Protkhāta-damstrāyate. Protkhāta means extracted, the poison teeth. The poison teeth of the tea, uh, teeth of the snake is dangerous. Now, here is a snake. Everyone is afraid, ""Oh, snake! Snake! Snake!"" But if everyone knows that his poison teeth have been taken away, then there is no more danger. Similarly, these indriyas have been compared with the kāla - sarpa -paṭalī. Kāla - sarpa -paṭalī. But..."
Dr. Patel,What do you call?,Prabhupāda," Kāla , kāla - sarpa means the dead(ly) poisonous snake, kāla - sarpa -paṭalī. Everyone knows. As soon as you use some indriya , there is some dangerous result. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpanā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ [SB 7.9.45 ] . Take for... [break]"
Dr. Patel,Oṁ is God.,Prabhupāda," Oṁ , yes. Kṛṣṇa says, praṇavaḥ sarva - vedeṣu . Praṇavaḥ sarva - vedeṣu ."
Chandobhai,That is oṁ in that way.,Prabhupāda, Because oṁ means Kṛṣṇa . That is mām .
Dr. Patel,I told you.,Prabhupāda," When one chanting oṁ , if he remembers just the oṁ is Kṛṣṇa , then he's successful. Mām . Oṁ ity ekākṣaraṁ..."
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,Oṁ ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma .; It is ekākṣara Brahman .; Vyāharan mām .,Prabhupāda, Vyāharan mām . If he knows...
Dr. Patel,Vyāharan mām anusmara [ Bg. 8.7 ].,Prabhupāda," Anusmara . If he knows that oṁkāra is Kṛṣṇa , then he's successful. If he thinks that oṁkāra is something else than Kṛṣṇa , then he's not successful."
Chandobhai,,Prabhupāda, So there is no need of doing this or that. Simply always remember Kṛṣṇa . That is the conclusion.
Chandobhai,,Prabhupāda," That is saṁsiddhi. They are mahātmās, those who are always remembering Kṛṣṇa . They are mahātmās. Not by the red dress. No, that is not mahātmā . Even in white dress you can become. If you always chant and remember Kṛṣṇa , you become mahātmā ."
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,"Now there is a higher philosophy: ā- brahma -bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna [Bg. 8.16 ] , mām upetya punar janma ... [Bg. 8.15 ]. No?; Mām eti janardana .",Prabhupāda, No.
Chandobhai,Mām evaiti kaunteya punar janma na vidyate .,Prabhupāda," Ā- brahma -bhuvanāl lokāḥ ... Within this material world, these persons who are doing pious activities, they are promoted to the higher planetary systems. But even if you go to the Brahmaloka—that is the highest—where you can get millions of years, your life duration, but still, kṣīṇe puṇye martya - lokaṁ viṣanti [Bg. 9.21 ] , you have to come back."
Chandobhai,"Sahasra - yuga -paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. 8.17 ] , rātriṁ ...",Prabhupāda," Now He explaining what is Brahmaloka. That one day of Brahmā , you cannot calculate. And still, you have to die."
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,Twelve hundred yugas is called one Brahmā .; So our hundred years is nothing for...,Prabhupāda, It is nothing.
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,It is a moment only.; Twelve hundred yugas.,Prabhupāda," No, no, no. Not twelve hundred yugas. One thousand yugas. One thousand. Sahasra - yuga -paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. 8.17 ] ."
Dr. Patel,"Sahasra - yuga means four yugas, (Hindi) like that...",Prabhupāda, That... Four yugas multiplied by one thousand.
Dr. Patel,By one thousand.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Four thousand.,Prabhupāda," So four yuga means forty-three lakhs of years. Now, add three zeroes. Forty-three lakhs of years, add three zeroes. Then how many?"
Dr. Patel,"About four, about... Car...",Prabhupāda," Eh? Forty-three lakhs, as..."
Dr. Patel,Car ardha ...,Prabhupāda," Forty-three, eight zeroes."
Dr. Patel,Car... (Gujarati),Prabhupāda," This is Brahmā's twelve days, uh, twelve hours."
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,"Rātri , (Gujarati); Why not... There's a little question to ask: What are the Pitṛloka , Martyaloka and this...?",Prabhupāda, They are planets.
Chandobhai,And the Brahmaloka and all the...?,Prabhupāda," Yes. They are different... Just like Candraloka, Sūryaloka, Vāyuloka."
Chandobhai,What is that Pitṛloka actually?,Prabhupāda," Pitṛloka means the... There is a, called a Pitṛloka ."
Chandobhai,"But then in the Pitrloka is it may be that, there may be remembrances of the charity, activities, and all these things or...",Prabhupāda," No, these are all material."
Dr. Patel; Chandobhai,"Pitṛloka (Gujarati) They are all your past pitṛs.; No, let us hear from him.",Prabhupāda," Pitṝn yānti ... Devān yānti ... What is that? Deva ... Pitṝn yānti pitṛ - vrataḥ . So those who are just like fond of performing śraddhās, karma - kāṇḍa , they go to the Pitṛloka ."
Dr. Patel,"These are all, I mean, ordained to perform śraddhā , all Vaiṣṇavas.",Prabhupāda," Yes. No, Vaiṣṇavas do not do so."
Dr. Patel,"We are... We, all are, all of us, are we not doing...",Prabhupāda, No.
Dr. Patel,Śraddhā ceremony...,Prabhupāda," The Vaiṣṇava , Vaiṣṇava has no duty except serving Kṛṣṇa . That's all."
Dr. Patel,That's right. But a Vaiṣṇava family...,Prabhupāda, No.
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,"Gṛhasthas, gṛhasthas.; Gṛhasthas.",Prabhupāda," He, whatever he may be. That is stated, that is stated that..."
Dr. Patel,Only Jains can do.,Prabhupāda," That is stated that pitṛṇām . No, what is that verse? Devarṣi -bhūtāpta- nṛnam - pitṛṇām [SB 11.5.41] . We are... Just like we are indebted to our forefathers, family, similarly we are indebted to devas, the demigods. Just like the sun is supplying light. So we are indebted. Deva , ṛṣi , to the great, big, big, saintly ṛṣis. They have given us the śāstras. Devarṣi , devarṣi bhūtā ... Bhūtā , ordinary living entities. Just like you are taking milk from the cows. And another, horse, is giving me service. So devarṣi - bhūtā apta , relatives. We take so much help from relatives. Devarṣi -bhūtāpta- nṛnam , ordinary human beings. Pitṛṇām . And the pitṛs. So we are debted to so many. If you want to clear up the debts, it will take millions of births. (laughter) So devarṣi -bhūtāpta- nṛnam - pitṛṇāṁ nayaṁ kiṅkara na ṛni ca rājan [SB 11.5.41] . This man is neither servant nor indebted. Who? Sarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ mukundam . One who has taken... That Kṛṣṇa says, that ""You just surrender unto Me. I will protect you."" So if he does not do anything else... One may think that he is being entangled in sinful activities because he does not do other duties. But Kṛṣṇa says, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66 ] . So one who has taken shelter, full shelter unto Kṛṣṇa , he doesn't require to do any so-called social, political and other duties. He doesn't require."
Dr. Patel,And here He means... He's about those pralaya . Bhūta - grāmaḥ sa evāyaṁ bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. 8.19 ] .,Prabhupāda, Yes.

So they have no information what is that spiritual world. Therefore it is said that... Here it is going on, pralaya , anya pralaya . During Brahmā's night, there is dissolution. Again creation. And when Brahmā dies, there is another dissolution. That is going on. But paras tasmāt , above this creation and dissolution, there is another nature. That is sanātana . That is eternal."

Dr. Patel,Puruṣa ...,Prabhupāda, Ananya bhaktyā .
Dr. Patel,"Sir, I am repeating. Puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā labhyas tv anyayā .",Prabhupāda," That, the predominating Deity in that sanātana world, spiritual world, is puruṣa , a person. Purusa , a person. And He is achieved- bhaktya ananya . Not by mix. Mixing this, mixing that. ""This is also good. This is also good."" No. He cannot. Bhaktya ananyayā ."

Dr. Patel,Just as (indistinct) saw a whole world within the mouth of Bala Mukunda .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Within the body of Bala Mukunda .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Yasyāntaḥ- sthani bhūtāni yena sarvam idaṁ tatam .,Prabhupāda, This is material calculation.
Dr. Patel,Agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ - māsā uttarāyaṇam ...,Prabhupāda," Then he assures, assures Arjuna that ""You are assured. Your coming to Me is assured."""
Dr. Patel,(Gujarati),Prabhupāda, This is material calculation.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is the position. Sarveṣu kāleṣu . Not that sometimes here and sometimes there. That will take long time, but unless one comes to sarveṣu kāleṣu , always thinking of Kṛṣṇa ..."

Dr. Patel,Yajnesu .,Prabhupāda," Yes. So if one understands that all these pious activities, charity, performance of sacrifices, and so many other things, only by Kṛṣṇa bhakti can be achieved, then he's assured."
Dr. Patel,This is the last verse.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ... yuktena . Now just this woman is carrying a load on her head, how she's keeping balance. He cannot do that."
Dr. Patel,"That is Rāmakrishna Paramahaṁsa said. No, no, that is not Indira Gandhi . Rāmakrishna Paramahaṁsa said the same thing as you say...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,...that she should remain...,Prabhupāda, It is not Ramakrishna Paramahamsa . This is śāstric.
Dr. Patel,"While we're talking about all these things, but the mind is in the load there. Their mind is on the load.",Prabhupāda," So... [break] ...by abhyāsa yoga - yuktena [Bg. 8.8 ] , everything can be done."
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : Prabhupāda, can you tell us maybe something about Lord Rāmacandra's activities, today being Rāma - naumi .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Now, you can, some of you can speak about Lord Rāmacandra . No? Dr. Patel, you can speak something about..."
Dr. Patel; Bhāgavata,About what?; Bhāgavata : Lord Rāmacandra's activities.,Prabhupāda, [break] ... tarān niyamena tiṣṭhan . [break] God is not obliged to accept your direction. (laughter)
Dr. Patel,He'll not oblige the brāhmaṇas unfortunately. He'll oblige only the kṣatriyas. I don't know why.,Prabhupāda," Because he comes: paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. 4.8 ] . That is kṣatriya's business. Sādhu protection (Hindi). This is kṣatriya's business. God has got two business. Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām . If you want to prove nonviolence from Bhagavad- gītā , it is difficult. (laughs) It is not possible. He says that ""I have got two business: paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām , dharma -saṁsthāpanārthāya... "" Unless these two things are there, there cannot be establishment of real law and order. [break] ...everywhere, law and order. In spiritual also. Unless there is law and order, it is chaos. Law and order must be there."
Dr. Patel,Society came into existence after the evolution of the civilization.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Patel,"Society came into existence after the evolution of the proper civilization. Before, when... [break]",Prabhupāda," ...right civilization begins when the society is organized. Otherwise, it's cats' and dogs' civilization. That is not civilization. Unless... Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān [ Cc. Madhya 8.58 ] . The society becomes perfect when the members of the society can understand that this human body is meant for satisfying Viṣṇu . That is the beginning of organized society. So long they do not know that, that is animal society. Because the animals, they do not know that."
Dr. Patel,Shall we go back?,Prabhupāda," Yes. The animals, they do not know. [break] They do not know it, that ""We have to satisfy the Supreme Viṣṇu ."" So unless the society comes to this consciousness that ""We have to satisfy the Supreme,"" that is not human society. Now, how they will understand? Therefore four divisions."
Dr. Patel,Guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] .,Prabhupāda," Guṇa ... Yes. So if the four divisions work nicely, then it is healthy society. Otherwise it is not. If different parts of your body work nicely, then you are healthy."
Dr. Patel,"Each section of the society has to, I mean, work as a...",Prabhupāda, For the maintenance.
Dr. Patel,...part of the whole.,Prabhupāda," Whole, yes. That doesn't matter whether you are śūdra or brāhmaṇa . Your aim should be how to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then it is perfect."
Dr. Patel,They fall down from their own position.,Prabhupāda," Yes. It doesn't matter whether a brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , or vaiśya , śūdra . If you are conscious that ""I have to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to my capacity of work,"" then he'll not fall down. He'll not fall down. [break] ...fall down from the position, then it is dead society. It is not living society. At the present moment. Yes. If you don't find actual brāhmaṇa , don't find actual kṣatriya , don't find actual vaiśya , so all śūdras. And there is no guide. Therefore chaotic condition. [break] ...ship without rudder? What is called? Yes. They do not know what is the aim of life. Ask any leader. The leader, he says, ""No, this aim of life is to drink and enjoy. That's all."" This is going on. After diplomacy, politics, when they are tired, they go to the hotel or club and enjoy and drink. That's all. This is their aim of life. [break] ...countries there are even shops, they indulge all these things, topless, bottomless, like that. Because that is the only solace to this materialistic life. There is no other. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45 ] . That is their... They have no other pleasure except that sex life. They have no information that there is another pleasure. That, they, they are not educated. So they must come to the sex life only."
Dr. Patel,I think this has become very wild after the Second World War.,Prabhupāda," No, no. It is always there. It is always there. That is material world. Material world means that, sex life. That's all. And if you increase it, then you increase your material life more and more. Therefore the process is tapasā brahmacaryena [SB 6.1.13 ] . The brahmācārya is so much stressed. Tapasā brahmacaryena . Samena damena vā , tyāgena śaucena yamena niyamena vā . This is the process of human life. Nāyaṁ deho deha - bhājāṁ nṛloke kāṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ- bhujāṁ ye [SB 5.5.1 ] . This human body is not meant for working hard like pigs for sense gratification. So they have been taught to become pigs. No discrimination of sex. The pig has no discrimination. So they have been taught. Not... When it is in śāstra , that means it is from the very beginning. A class of men are like pigs and hogs there are, always. So therefore Rsabhādeva is forbidding his sons that ""This human form of life is not to waste like the pigs and hogs."" Then what? Tapasā . Tapo divyaṁ putrakāḥ ..."
Dr. Patel,Ṛṣabhadeva's hundred sons.,Prabhupāda, Eh? Yes. Tapo divyaṁ putrakāḥ [SB 5.5.1 ] .
Dr. Patel,Eighty-one sons. Eighty-one sons.,Prabhupāda," Jaya . It is... Human life is meant for tapasya , but where is tapasya ? They are simply teaching, ""Yes, here is contraceptive method. Take."" No,... Wine shop..."
Dr. Patel,They give it free of charge in the...,Prabhupāda," Yes. So there is no question of tapasya now. Therefore the whole population is pigs, hogs and dogs. How you can expect peace and prosperity in this society? That is not possible. It is a society of pigs and hogs. Śva-viḍ... Śva-viḍ- varāha uṣṭra - kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ . If somebody says, ""If the..., it is a society of pigs and hogs, then what about these leaders?"""
Dr. Patel,They are bigger hogs and pigs.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That's all. That is stated: śva -viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ [ SB 2.3.19 ] . He's also a big paśuḥ . That's all. Otherwise how he can dare to see that ""Bhajan is nuisance""? Because it is paśuḥ . He's not even a human being. Otherwise how he dares say like that? [break] ...reply that dacoit. If I reply, then I have to call him, ""You are a paśuḥ ."""
Dr. Patel,And he told me...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"...Girirāja, that he wants to reply separately.",Prabhupāda, [break] ...why...

Dr. Patel,"No, we have not read. I don't know how it came to our...",Prabhupāda, Yes. [break] ...talking of this letter of commissioner.
Dr. Patel,"Oh, commissioner. [break]",Prabhupāda," They, because today's Rāma Naumi , they're taking bath?"
Dr. Patel,"Yes, they are taking bath. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...says that ""Why don't you go to the forest?"""
Dr. Patel,But that somebody must have told you.,Prabhupāda," No, no. One of the important men. What is the name of that...?"
Girirāja,Yogendrabhai.,Prabhupāda, Yogendra . Yes. He's Yogendra . Yogi .
Dr. Patel,Yogendra Patel.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Here is the sample of yogi . Kṛṣṇa says, imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ . Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ [ Bg . 4.2 ] . And a yogi says that ""Go to the forest."" Eh? The rājarṣis are in the forest?"
Dr. Patel,This is a mūḍha . [break],Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...garland, this girl. Garland just like beads."
Satsvarūpa,Make a garland out of stone?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Not stone.
Satsvarūpa,Shells.,Prabhupāda," They are conch shells, small conchshells. They are called gunja , gunja . They are called gunja ? [break]"
Guest (4) (Indian man),... ahaṁ yogī nikita. (?) So what is that? Can you give me some light on that?,Prabhupāda, Karma - yogī means one who does everything for Kṛṣṇa . He's karma - yogī .
Guest (1),One who does everything for...?,Prabhupāda, For Kṛṣṇa .
Guest (1),For Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Just like you are doing, doing some work. For whom you are doing?"
Guest (1),For my own benefit.,Prabhupāda," That's all. So that is karma . But when you do the same thing for Kṛṣṇa , that is karma - yoga ."
Guest (1),"But (Hindi), if you do it for others, for Kṛṣṇa , for Kṛṣṇa's...",Prabhupāda, Others... Others means... That is also a humbug. You cannot do anything for others. You do everything for yourself. That is a false propaganda. You see? That is humbugism. So either you can do for yourself or for Kṛṣṇa . That's all.
Guest (1),I see. (Gujarati),Prabhupāda," [break] ...become a slogan nowadays. Nobody does for others. ""For others,"" ""For the poor,"" these are all humbug."
Guest (1),"You think people are doing something hospitals, that is for others?",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is also puṇya - karma .
Guest (1),"(Hindi) Helping these temples, hospitals...?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Temple construction is different from hospital construction. That is for Kṛṣṇa .
Guest (1),But suppose somebody's doing hospitals. Is it not for others?,Prabhupāda," Yes. But how many you can give shelter? A few. There are so many suffering people. You cannot provide hospitals for all of them. The hospitals are increasing, and the disease also increasing."
Guest (1),"No, as you say that doing for others is humbug.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Humbug means he cannot do it."
Guest (1),Ācchā.,Prabhupāda, He cannot do it. He can do to his satisfaction only. That is... That is also for his satisfaction.
Guest (1),I see.,Prabhupāda," Because by opening hospital, you cannot stop disease. That is not possible. Then what you are doing for the others? That is for your satisfaction. Try to understand. Because you cannot do anything, but still, you are wasting your time. That is for your satisfaction."
Guest (1),Naturally for myself.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa . You cannot do anything. The hospitals are increasing, beds are increasing, and the diseases are increasing. Then what can you do?"
Guest (1),We can do our own satisfaction.,Prabhupāda," That's all. [break] ...done not meant for Kṛṣṇa , that is for his own satisfaction. Just like Arjuna wanted to become nonviolent: ""No, no, Kṛṣṇa . I cannot kill my kinsmen."" That is a good proposal. But that was his satisfaction."
Guest (1),That is very correct.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That was his satisfaction. But Kṛṣṇa wanted that ""You must fight."" And when he agreed to that, that is his perfection. Before that, he was trying to satisfy he."
Guest (1),"Yes. When he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa , that was his...",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is the only purpose of life. Anything that is done, that is useless waste of time. Therefore Kṛṣṇa particularly said, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vra... [Bg. 18.66 ]. That is ekam . You try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa only. That will give you perfection. Otherwise your own satisfaction, that's all."
Guest (1),"Yes, very correct, very correct.",Prabhupāda," Whatever you do, that is your satisfaction. That is karma ."
Guest (1),But not yogi .,Prabhupāda," No, karma . [break] ...for your own sense satisfaction, that is karma . And if you do it for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, that is karma - yoga ."
Makhanlal,Pure bhakti and karma - yoga considered to be exactly the same?,Prabhupāda, Exactly the same.
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : That is the difference between the Chapter Karma - yoga and Karma - yoga in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Pure, pure devotion means Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam ."
Guest (1),I read fifteen percent power cut from today in the state. They have not able to do the service in electric. [break],Prabhupāda," ...cut, cent percent. [break]"
Makhanlal,"...you're performing, is the vaidhī - bhakti stage of...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Makhanlal,"...of the sādhana - bhakti , the regulative principles.",Prabhupāda," Yes, vaidhī - bhakti means regulative principles, and when you are accustomed, automatically you perform, that is rāga - bhakti ."
Makhanlal,So vaidhī - bhakti is considered superior to karma - yoga then.,Prabhupāda, No. Karma - yoga is better.
Makhanlal,Karma - yoga is better?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man,Pure bhakti is superior.,Prabhupāda," Pure bhakti is ṣravaṇaṁ kīrtanam . Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇu - smaraṇaṁ pāda - sevanam , that is pure bhakti . [break]"
Yaśomatīnandana,...formed by anybody.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,Karma - yoga .,Prabhupāda," Unless one is inclined to take to devotion, it is not possible to take to karma - yoga . Who can sacrifice the profit?"
Yaśomatīnandana,Does karma - yoga mean to follow exactly the śāstras?,Prabhupāda, Karma - yoga means yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi kuruṣva tat mad - arpaṇam .
Yaśomatīnandana,Doing only for Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is karma - yoga .
Devotee,Which means?,Prabhupāda," ""Whatever you do, the result give Me."""
Devotee,To Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,"So we are also, those who are on the vaidhi - bhakti (indistinct) on karma - yoga path because we are...",Prabhupāda, Yes. They are acting under the order of the spiritual master. That is bhakti - yoga .
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : So when one follows the nine activities of devotion purely, that is pure bhakti .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : Then when he's following those nine activities, then he's superior.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Bhāgavata,"Bhāgavata : Then that's superior to karma - yoga , to follow those nine principles purely.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Makhanlal,Rāgānugā - bhakti is also superior to karma - yoga then?,Prabhupāda, Bhakti is perfect stage. That is not for ordinary man.
Yaśomatīnandana,What is the difference between karma - yoga and... or bhakti because they also (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," Now go on doing your duty, you'll understand (indistinct). Don't try to understand in one day."
Bhāgavata,Bhāgavata : It will be revealed to us as we act.,Prabhupāda," Yes, the more you become in service attitude, things will be revealed to you. (Sanskrit) prakaśante. Becomes, it becomes manifest. Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau sam eva sphuraty adhaḥ [ Brs . 1.2.234] . [break] ...answers."
Dr. Patel,"What I will say now... I will make one man sit between the two, Vaiṣṇavas.",Prabhupāda, You know what the paramahaṁsas do?
Guests; Dr. Patel,"It is mixed up.; It is what I give to that man. Mix up, then it is far better.",Prabhupāda, So they are all paramahaṁsas.
Dr. Patel; Guest (2); Dr. Patel; Devotee,Then let them miss. We don't mind. But they don't miss that door(?).; (Gujarati); (Gujarati conversation) [break]; Till the sun goes down.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Dr. Patel,"Not the sun. Whole day (indistinct) morning. That is how you are passing? If the sun goes down in the night..., day time? [break]",Prabhupāda," ...but if one can continue, that's all right. (end)"
Dr. Patel,"Anasūyave , one who is not cajoling against God.",Prabhupāda," No. One who is not envious. A person generally... All conditioned souls, they are envious of God, envious. ""Why He should be God? I am God. I am God."" So Arjuna is not like that person. Therefore he is speaking to Arjuna . He is devotee. In the Fourth Chapter also, He said bhakto 'si priyo 'si [ Bg . 4.3 ] . Therefore Kṛṣṇa does not expose Himself unless one is devotee. This is first qualification. So to understand Bhagavad- gītā one must be a devotee. The so-called jñānī , yogis, they cannot understand. It is not possible, because they are trying to become God. Although it is simply dream, they can never become, but they are envious, that ""Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? I have got so many gods."" Anasūyave ."
Dr. Patel,Rāja - vidya rāja - guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam pratyakṣa .,Prabhupāda, Avagamam .
Dr. Patel,Avagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su - sukhaṁ kartum avyayam [Bg. 9.2 ] .,Prabhupāda," Yes. And the bhakti - yoga ... This is bhakti - yoga . Therefore it is rāja - vidya ; means all kinds of learning, it is the king of..."
Dr. Patel,King of all.,Prabhupāda," So rāja - vidya and rāja - guhyam , most confident, very secret. It is not... And pavitram , uttamam ."
Dr. Patel,Pratyakṣa avagamam .,Prabhupāda," And pratyakṣa avagamaṁ dharmyam . If you are jñānī , karmi , yogi , you cannot immediately directly perceive whether actually you have got the thing, but bhakti - yoga is like that. Bhakti - yoga , if you perform, you will perceive that ""Yes, I am in this stage. I am in this stage."" That has been described by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Just like when you are hungry and you are eating something, you can understand... (aside:) Don't come very near. You can understand that how much satisfaction you have got by eating. You haven't got to ask anybody, ""Whether I am eating?"" You can understand. The bhakti - yoga is so nice thing that if you execute it, you will understand your position. And it is su - sukham . To execute bhakti - yoga , there is no difficulty. It is always happy. Just like our program. Program is chant, dance, take prasādam . And if you take yoga system, jñāna system, first of all you have to become a very great learned scholar, and then yoga system, you have to practice so many āsanas, press your nose, and so many things. But here everything is very happy: chant, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , dance and then take prasādam , and you understand where you are. This is the su - sukham . And avyayam . Avyayam means whatever little bhakti - yoga you have advanced, that is permanent."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. So this is His inconceivable potency. Everything is resting on Him. Without Him, there is nothing. Nothing can exist. Still... The same argument comes again, that because the dog or the anything is resting on me, it does not mean I am dog. Daridra , he is resting on me, that does not mean I am daridra . Yes. This is the... This is wrong conception, misleading people. This kind of coined word, simply misleading people."
Dr. Patel,Na ca mat - sthāni bhūtāni .,Prabhupāda, Yes. I have nothing to do with daridra . He is suffering of his own karma .
Dr. Patel,"But here a little difficulty for me. Here on the first line He says, mat - sthāni sarva - bhūtāni [Bg. 9.4 ] . Second line He says, na ca mat - sthāni bhūtāni paśya me yogam aiśvaram .",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Therefore, na ca mat - sthāni : ""Although I am there, I am not there."" That is inconceivable, simultaneously not also, just to warn these people that although Nārāyaṇa is within the daridra or the dog, that does not mean I am dog or I am daridra ."
Dr. Patel,Bhūta -bhṛn na ca bhūta -stho mamātmā bhūta - bhāvanaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Bhūta - stha bhūta - bhāvanaḥ : ""Everything is coming from Me. I am also within that, but still..."" It is called acintya -bhedābheda. ""I am there; I am not there."""
Dr. Patel,Yathākāśa-sthito nityaṁ vāyuḥ sarvatra -go mahān .,Prabhupāda," Ah, this is the example."
Dr. Patel,Tathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni mat -sthānīty upadhāraya .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like this cloud. The cloud we say, ""In the sky."" The cloud is not in the sky. It is on the air. They mistake this, that ""Nārāyaṇa is there."" Nārāyaṇa is not there. Nārāyaṇa is separate. That is their foolishness."
Dr. Patel,Kalpādau visṛjāmy aham .,Prabhupāda," And again there is kalpa . Again they come out. In this way they do not become liberated. Just like the child, those who are being, what is called, contraceptive method, abortion. These are very sinful. Because they have done killing, so they enter into the mother's womb and they are again killed, and again enter into the mother's womb, and again killed. He does not see the light. Similarly, those who are sinful, they are given chance in material manifestation, ""Now work for Kṛṣṇa consciousness."" But they do not do that. Again enters, again come out. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. 8.19 ] . This is going on. How much they are wasting their time, not taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
Dr. Patel,Prakṛti and puruṣa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is wrong theory. Actually, He says visṛjāmi , ahaṁ visṛjāmi : ""I do."""
Dr. Patel,"Prakṛtiṁ svām avaṣṭabhya : ""Controlling my prakṛti .""",Prabhupāda," Avaṣṭabhya , now entering."
Dr. Patel,"""Entering into My prakṛti , I am sṛjāmi , punaḥ punaḥ.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. He is outside; He is inside."
Indian,"And then leave it in the control of the prakṛti , prakṛter vaśāt , avaṣaṁ prakṛter vaṣāt . Bhūta - grāmam imaṁ kṛtsnam avaṣām prakṛter vaśāt .",Prabhupāda," Bhūta - grāmam , not He."
Dr. Patel,"Bhūta - grāmam , is due to the prakṛti , after creating the bhūtas.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. The same thing, that just like a judge orders, ""This man should be hanged,"" but the judge is not affected by such thing. He's not affected. Just like you surgical, you are going on surgical operation. You are not affected. The man is crying, ""Oh, here, doctor, you are killing me, killing me, killing me."" But the killing or not killing, doctor Saheb is not in con-(indistinct)."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is the... These rascal atheist class, they think that prakṛti is creating. Prakṛti is creating, that the ocean is created by prakṛti . But why the ocean does not come here? Fifty, sixty yards? Because there is order that ""You cannot come here."" This big ocean, immediately, in one minute, it can swallow up whole Bombay. Therefore it is controlled. It is controlled by the Supreme. Mayādhyakṣeṇa."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," The whole worldly affairs is going on... The godless atheists, they cannot understand it, that behind this prakṛti , the wonderful prakṛti , so many things happening... It is not happening independently."
Dr. Patel,By the order of God.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Mayādhyakṣeṇa: ""Under My control."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Now, these mūḍhas, they will think, ""Huh? It is controlled by Kṛṣṇa ? He is ordinary man like this."" A mūḍha . Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto. He does not know how much powerful is Kṛṣṇa , the mūḍha ."
Dr. Patel,"But you see, this is not like this, that those fools... [break]",Prabhupāda," That is also another mūḍha , but supposing if Kṛṣṇa says that ""I am controlling the whole universe."" The mūḍha will not believe it. ""Huh? How is that? How...? Such a big gigantic prakṛti , and He is a person. He can control?"" The mūḍha cannot understand. He cannot understand that how much powerful is Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ .,Prabhupāda, Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ . They do not know what is the all-omniscient nature of Kṛṣṇa .
Dr. Patel,The spiritual power of Kṛṣṇa . No. Paraṁ bhāva ? Moghāśā mogha -karmāṇo mogha - jñānā vicetasaḥ [Bg. 9.12 ] .,Prabhupāda," Therefore, as soon as these rascals, they get little power, yogic perfection, they think, ""I have become God. I have become God."""
Dr. Patel,Mogha - jñānā vicetasaḥ . (laughing),Prabhupāda," Yes. Rascal, he thinks that because ""I can make like this, little gold, therefore I have become God."" The rascal does not think that ""I am making, say, two grains or five grains of gold, but one who has made gold mines, millions, so he will be God or I will be God?"" The rascal does not think that. And other rascals follow, ""Oh, here is God. Here is God. He is creating gold."" You see? Therefore mūḍha ."
Dr. Patel,Moghāśā mogha -karmāṇo mogha - jñānā vicetasaḥ [Bg. 9.12 ] .,Prabhupāda," Ah, moghāśā. They are thinking that ""I will become like this, I will become like this."" Karmis are thinking like this, jñānīs are thinking like this. Yogis are... But they are all false, mūḍhas. Moghāśā. Their hope will be frustrated. Moghāśā. Moghāśā mogha -karmāṇo [Bg. 9.12 ] . Mogha means frustration. Moghāśā mogha -karmāṇo [Bg. 9.12 ] ."
Dr. Patel,Rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ śritāḥ .,Prabhupāda, Yes. Mohinīm . They are that aviśuddha - buddhayaḥ . Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādhṛta-yusmad- aṅghrayaḥ [SB 10.2.32 ] . They are all impure. Their intelligence is not purified.
Dr. Patel,Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. 9.13 ] .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Now... Now here come in the... These people are moghāśā, moghāśā. Their all hopes will be frustrated. But another class, mahātmā . Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha [Bg. 9.13 ] . They take shelter of the spiritual energy. Daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ . Because they, the symptom is bhajanty ananya manasaḥ , ""Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" They are not captivated by the so-called jñānīs, yogis, karmis, no. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha - vratāḥ [Bg. 9.14 ] .,Prabhupāda, Yes. Again explained. Satataṁ kīrtayanto. That is their only business.
Dr. Patel,Namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā nitya - yuktā upāsate .,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is being done in every ISKCON center. Satataṁ kīrtayanto, chanting always Kṛṣṇa , namasyantas, offering obeisances. Everything in Kṛṣṇa . This is mahātmā ."
Dr. Patel,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Difficult... The jñāna - yoga ... Indirectly. They are bhajante mām , but in a different way. And the mahātmās, those who are bhaktas, they are directly in the way. And they are indirectly, in this way."
Dr. Patel,Ekatvena pṛthaktvena bahudhā viśvato - mukham .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Ekatvena : ""Now, I am, I am God."""
Dr. Patel,Pṛthaktvena . Bahudhā viśvato - mukham .,Prabhupāda," Pantheism, pantheism, bahudhā . Bahudhā means God has become pantheism."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Everything is I. Everything is I."" Because it is His energy, therefore He is. Śakti-śaktimator abhedaḥ. The energy and the energetic, they are identical."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Everything, these Vedas, that I am."" Vedaiś cāham, aham eva vedyaḥ . So these... There are rascals. They claim that ""We are Vedic student. We don't believe in Kṛṣṇa . We don't believe in Bhagavad- gītā . "" You know this rascal society?"
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Cause and effect.
Dr. Patel,Cause and effect. Now comes about the brāhmaṇa class who are making the yajñas.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Svar- gatim , those who are desiring to go to the Svarga - loka , heavenly planet, they go. They go..."
Dr. Patel,And come back.,Prabhupāda, ...but again come back.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. But those who are devotees, they do not come back."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," This is trayī - dharma , Vedic process."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," The devotees, they do not care for anybody. Simply depending on Kṛṣṇa . Therefore whatever necessities they require, Kṛṣṇa will supply."
Dr. Patel,"Ye 'py anya - devatā - bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ. (Hindi) Te 'pi mām eva kaunteya yajanty avidhi - pūrvakam [Bg. 9.23 ] . Ahaṁ hi sarva - yajñānāṁ bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca , na tu mām abhijānanti tattva ...[Bg. 9.24 ].",Prabhupāda," Yes. He is performing yajña . Just like the yajnic brāhmaṇa in Vṛndāvana . Kṛṣṇa went there and asked for some food. ""Heḥ!"""
Dr. Patel,They did not give.,Prabhupāda, They did not give.
Dr. Patel,Their wives gave.,Prabhupāda," All yajnic brāhmaṇas, like that. There are so many fools like that. They are thinking that ""I am, we are doing yajñas, I am doing this, I am doing that. What is this Kṛṣṇa ? The Kṛṣṇa devotees are less intelligent. They are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa ."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Ah, yes. ""Now, the devayājas, they can go to the heavenly planet. Pitṛs and śraddhā performer, they go Pitṛloka . Bhūtejyā. Those who are worshiping this material world, they remain here. But if one worships Me, he comes to Me."""
Dr. Patel,Come to Me in Goloka Vṛndāvana .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everything is open, but an intelligent person will think that ""Why shall I go to Svarga - loka ? Why shall I remain here? Why shall I go to Pitṛloka ? Let me go direct to Kṛṣṇa ."" Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6 ]. That is intelligent, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, to take to Kṛṣṇa wholeheartedly. That is real intelligence. Otherwise mūḍha , whatever he may be."
Dr. Patel,Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [ Bg. 9.26 ] .,Prabhupāda," Ah. And to satisfy Kṛṣṇa , it does not require any expensive material. If you have nothing to offer, you can offer patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ . He will be satisfied. And performing this yajña and other, oh, you have got to collect so much ghee, so much grain, so much mantras, so many learned brāhmaṇas and this and that. You have nothing to do. Anywhere, any part of the world, universal. Any man, poor man, rich man, can offer Kṛṣṇa whatever He has got. Kṛṣṇa is satisfied."
Dr. Patel,Tad ahaṁ bhakty- upahṛtam .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Bhaktya - upahṛtam aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ. Yes. ""Because he has offered Me with faith and devotion and love, I accept it."" So when Kṛṣṇa eats something from your hand, then what remains? You gain perfection. All perfection is there. If Kṛṣṇa is accepting something from your hand, ""Yes, I will eat it."" Then?"
Dr. Patel,Whatever you do for Him and forget about it.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Unless you do for Him, how you can give Him? Because you are thinking that ""I am doing for me,"" therefore you do not give to Kṛṣṇa . You keep it in your pocket."
Dr. Patel,"Śubhāśubha-phalair evaṁ mokṣyase karma - bandhanaiḥ [Bg. 9.28 ]. Ah, yat tapasyasi kaunteya tad kuruṣva mad - arpaṇam [Bg. 9.27 ].",Prabhupāda," Yes. Tapasi , tapasya . There are many, they are very much addicted to tapasya , suska tapasya . Śūṣka tapasya . There are many stages. Unnecessarily starving, fasting, unnecessarily."
Dr. Patel,Karṣanti mām .,Prabhupāda," Ah. Yes. This is going on. Why? Take Kṛṣṇa prasādam , be happy, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and dance. Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam [Bg. 9.2 ]. Everything very nice to perform and very progressive, immediately."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. Sannyāsa - yoga means sa sannyāsī , the one who acts for Kṛṣṇa , sa sannyāsī ."
Dr. Patel,"Sannyāsa - yoga -yuktātmā. Means you have actually, I mean, sannyāsa means nyāsa of all attachment for the...",Prabhupāda," Nyāsa means giving up, giving up. Sat nyāsa , sannyāsa . Oṁ tat sat . Sat is Kṛṣṇa . Therefore when you sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa , that is real sannyāsa , not this dress. This dress is symbolical. That's all. Real thing is kāryaṁ karma karoti ya . Kāryam . ""Oh, it is my... Kṛṣṇa wants, everyone should surrender unto Him. Then I shall teach everyone to surrender to Kṛṣṇa ."" Kāryam . ""This is my business."" Kāryaṁ karma karoti , sa sannyāsī . What is that kāryam ? Kāryam means this is kāryam ."
Chandobhai,Yajñā dana tapa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] . You'll take a practical... My Guru Mahārāja gave me hint that book publication is more pleasing to me than Maṭha - mandira . So I took it and I began to publish books and that has come successful. Kāryaṁ karma . I took it, ""Oh, Guru Mahārāja wants that books should be published. So let me concentrate on this instead of..."" My creating so many centers, big, big temples, that is not my primary duty. My primary duty is to write books. Therefore I am going on still. These are coming automatically. Maybe this is the secret of my success."
Dr. Patel,Sannyāsa - yoga -yuktātmā vimukto mām upaiṣyasi .,Prabhupāda," Ah, karyam , that one should take the order of the guru , because guru is the representative of Kṛṣṇa . So when one takes... That is explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura in connection with the verse:"
Dr. Patel,Execute the order of the guru .,Prabhupāda, Guru . Yes. Very easy. That is the secret. Yasya deve parā bhaktir tathā deve yathā gurau [ ŚU 6.23] . Then he is sure to be successful. This is the secret.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Just see. They bhajanti , and these rascals has announced, ""This bhajana is nuisance."" Just see. This is Kali - yuga , and this is our Indian government. Ye bhajanti māṁ teṣam . He is always associating with God. ""I am always with him,"" ye bhajanti , and this rascal has remarked, ""bhajana nuisance."" Catur - vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. These are the statements. But we are... We did not take any..."
Dr. Patel,They are durācaris (?).,Prabhupāda," Yes. But we should have taken some step against this, the ""Why you have said like this?"" But nobody has taken."
Dr. Patel,But we are going to take steps. Let that man come.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Here... The first thing is one must have rigid, staunch faith in Kṛṣṇa . That is the qualification. Other things may be little devīation. It doesn't matter. The first thing is whether he is sticking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then he is sādhu ."
Dr. Patel,Ananya - bhāk .,Prabhupāda," Ananya - bhāk , yes. He has no other business."
Dr. Patel,"Because he is samyag vyavasito, he is rightly doing.",Prabhupāda," ""Although there are some bad habits,"" kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ , ""because he is My devotee, he will not be lost. He will take to the right position."""
Dr. Patel,"I'll read this twice, and twice we are...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Chandobhai,He has made a promise.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Kaunteya pratijānīhi . He has not promised. He says Arjuna , that ""You declare this."" Because sometimes for His devotee He breaks His promise. But because His devotee Arjuna will promise, it will be never frustrated. ""Oh, My devotee has promised."" Therefore He says, kaunteya pratijānīhi , ""You do this."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," This is the conclusion, bhajasva mām . Again bhajana ."
Dr. Patel,The highest...,Prabhupāda," Bhajasva mām . Again He's saying, bhajasva mām ."
Dr. Patel,The highest comes now.,Prabhupāda, That is the highest...
Dr. Patel,Highest comes now.,Prabhupāda," You know, while commenting this verse, Dr. Radhakrishnan, ""It is not to Kṛṣṇa ."" Just see. After reading so much he said, ""It is not to Kṛṣṇa ."" Just see. Mūḍha . (laughs) There is a Bengali proverb, sat - khanda rāmāyaṇa pāde , sitera na baba. (?) After reading the seven khandas..."""
Indian man,"Yes, he's Bengali.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that's all right. After reading the whole Rāmāyaṇa he is asking, ""Whose father is Sītā ?"" Similarly, this Dr. Radhakrishnan, after reading the whole chapter, he is advising, ""It is not to Kṛṣṇa ."" Just see how much rascal he is. And he is passing on as a great scholar."
Dr. Patel,I will read this three times. Man- mana bhava - mad -bhakto. (goes on),Prabhupāda, This is the conclusion.
Dr. Patel,"""When completely yourself are settled in Me, you have got to come to Me. You can't go anywhere else."" Again I will read the last. Man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī .",Prabhupāda," Very simple thing. You always think of Kṛṣṇa , man- manā , you become His devotee, man- manā bhava mad -bhakto, mad - yājī , worship Kṛṣṇa , and namaskuru . Where is the cost? No expenditure. If you think of Kṛṣṇa , if you worship Kṛṣṇa , if you offer obeisances to Him... Therefore this Deity is there. For these purposes. Man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. 18.65 ] . Simply by doing these four things, he is becoming liberated so much that he is going back to Godhead. That's all. [break] ...movement is very scientific movement, based on the teachings of Bhagavad- gītā . Most scientific. [break] We may be proud. Because this is scientific, therefore it is so quickly progressing. [break] ...take. This is mām cult. [break] ...so I was, that ""I want to start this movement,"" I was talking. So he very much appreciated and he promised in writing that ""As soon as I retire I shall join with you."" He wrote me."
Dr. Patel,"But then we have to tell him that ""Come on, you are retiring. Join. And if you...""",Prabhupāda, That I wrote also. He was silent.
Dr. Patel,"Now, you just tell him if you are following me here, there is one Dr. Patel who will take you. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...come for treatment. Why shall I? [break] Eight years old, older than me. So I am seventy-eight. Maybe eighty-six. Yes. He was also of the same age. Older than me."
Dr. Patel,You were all the time in Allahabad. You must be knowing them from very close part.,Prabhupāda," No, he was my customer. I used to go to his home. And he was coming to my shop. Yes. He was my customer. When 1928 congress was there, I sent him one letter that ""I want to become a delegate and go there."" So immediately, ""Yes, you come."" So I went to Calcutta and I told his secretary that ""Panditji has told me like this."" ""Yes, take this ticket."" Yes. I became... So I was criticizing my friend because the delegate fee is one rupee and the reception committee fee at that time was twenty-five rupees. And still, they were in the last seat. And because at that time Motilal Nehru became president, the president, the province in which the president becomes, that provincial member occupies the first seat. So we occupied the first seat from Allahabad. So I..."
Dr. Patel,Front seats.,Prabhupāda," Front seat, yes. So I was criticizing my friends in Calcutta that you have paid twenty-five rupees, you have got last seat. I have paid one rupee, I have first seat. We were very thickly... Not very thickly, but as customer... Do you know? I shall tell one incident. One day Jawaharlal Nehru came and he asked me, ""Give me prophylactic hair brush."" So I told, ""Panditji, we are selling prophylactic tube brush and we do not know that there is prophylactic hair brush."" ""No, you do not know. You get it for me. I want it."" So I got it from Bombay, here, and supplied him."
Dr. Patel,There is no prophylactic hair brush anywhere.,Prabhupāda," No, I got it, prophylactic hair brush."
Dr. Patel,"Somebody writes on it, on the name ""prophylactic.""",Prabhupāda," It may be whatever it may be. Now, just see that how much country conscious he was. He wants prophylactic brush. Not only that. I will tell you another incident. I was manufacturing one medicine, jagon(?) poultice. That is like anti -(?). So doctors were prescribing in Allahabad. So there was one big doctor, Dr. R.N. Banerjee Rai Baba. So sometimes I was seeing the doctors. So when I went there, ""Oh, it is very difficult to prescribe country medicine."" ""Why?"" ""Oh, you will be surprised. I prescribed this jagon poultice in the Nehru family."" He was physician. ""And Motilal Nehru said, 'Oh, doctor, excuse me. In the matter of medicine, you don't prescribe country medicine.' "" Just see. Believed in him."
Dr. Patel,"Gandhiji was never asking anything, for medicine much.",Prabhupāda," No, that is another thing. I know these people, this Nehru family. They were completely Europeanized. Outwardly for them... Even up to the last point of his life, if some European would come, he would immediately receive him. And if an Indian wants to see him, ""Oh, it will be..."" You will have to wait at least one. Everything London-made is very good. That was Jawaharlal Nehru's idea."
Indian,"That was absolutely opposing the Sardar Patel. Anything he wrote to another white skin, ""All right, let him be."" Lenin, we see, after all. Lenin.",Prabhupāda," That is also not good. But these people, they are svadeśi, for country, but I know them very well."
Dr. Patel,"No, he was right up to the end very conscious about this. Because of his Oxfordian education. I think he was in eternal hell, one of these things.(?) [break]",Prabhupāda," England. He was educated in England, but who can become..."
Dr. Patel,"Absolutely. It was a miracle, the greatest miracle.",Prabhupāda," Yes. He was... From very beginning of his birth, he is Englishman."
Dr. Patel,He was not allowed to speak Bengali by his parents.,Prabhupāda, Just see. Because in those days... [break]
Dr. Patel,We are forgetting Sanskrit very quickly.,Prabhupāda," No, no, those who are interested..."
Dr. Patel,"Now the schools, they don't teach as in our times. [break]",Prabhupāda," As soon as the kṣatriyas were negligent, immediately the brāhmaṇas should take step. That was the system. [break] ...offer advice to the kṣatriyas according to śāstra , and kṣatriyas would execute, and the vaiśyas would care for supply. And the śūdras, serving everyone. That's all. This is the system. [break] So he used to manufacture. To manufacture means śūdra . (end)"
Dr. Patel,Shall we? Śṛnu me paramaṁ vacaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Bhūya . He has already spoken so many important things; still, He wants to give information of further important part."
Dr. Patel,Yat te 'haṁ priyamāṇāya vakṣyāmi hita - kāmyayā .,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Because these things are to be spoken to My dear devotees, priyamāṇāya , for the special benefit of the devotees, not for the ordinary man."" Bhūya eva mahā - bāho [Bg. 10.1 ] . Mahā - bāho , this word is used, ""mighty-armed,"" who is very strong in devotional service, mahā - bāho . Bhūya eva mahā - bāho sṛnu me paramaṁ vacaḥ [Bg. 10.1 ] ."" Mahā - bāho , because you are My great devotee, therefore I am speaking further, very important subject matter."" Next line?"
Dr. Patel,"Prabhavaṁ , the original. Prabhavaṁ .",Prabhupāda," No. Prabhavaṁ means influence, influence, prabhava ."
Dr. Patel,Aham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Now, just try to understand this. Na me viduḥ sura - gaṇāḥ [Bg 10.2 ] . (Hindi) ...demigods, big, big demigods, they cannot understand Him. How the rascals with little education can understand? This is the meaning. Na me viduḥ sura - gaṇāḥ prabhavaṁ [Bg 10.2 ] . How much influence... The maharṣayaḥ , big, big saintly ṛṣis also, they cannot understand. Aham ādir hi devānām . Devānām means the first devas: the Brahmā , Viṣṇu , Maheśvara . So Viṣṇu is He Himself. Even Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā , they do not know. Devānām ."
Dr. Patel,Maheśvaram .,Prabhupāda," Maheśvaram , mahā īśvaram . There are īśvaras, but parameśvara or mahā - īśvara , that is Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,Shall I read further?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. All these good qualities, they are also coming from Him. Matta eva ."
Dr. Patel,"Good and bad, all qualities.",Prabhupāda, Yes. There is no bad. There is nothing bad. But...
Dr. Patel,Bhava abhāva bhayaṁ ca abhayaṁ ca .,Prabhupāda," Bhayaṁ ca abhayaṁ ca , contradictory, yes. That means all contradictions can be adjusted in Kṛṣṇa ."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes, ""The whole prajā , population, they are born of Me."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes, tattvataḥ , to understand Kṛṣṇa tattvataḥ ."
Dr. Patel,Rightly.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is the actually essence of Bhagavad- gītā . Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate : ""I am the origin of everything."" Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo and mattaḥ sarvam . Sarvam means including Brahmā , Viṣṇu , Maheśvara . Sarvam . Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate iti matvā . One who understands this. Bhajante . So just... The bhajana is for whom? Iti matvā . When one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything, even the original demigods, Brahmā , Viṣṇu , Maheśvara , when one understands perfectly this thing, then his bhajana is perfect."
Dr. Patel,Budhā bhāva - samanvitāḥ .,Prabhupāda," Bhāva , bhāva . Bhāva means love, feelings, feelings of love, ""Oh, Kṛṣṇa is so great."""
Dr. Patel,Mac- cittā mad - gata - prāṇāḥ .,Prabhupāda, And that is being described.
Dr. Patel,"Bodhayantaḥ parasparam , kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca .",Prabhupāda," Ramanti ca , yes. So instead of talking of Kṛṣṇa , they talk of politics, sociology, all nonsense. Simply waste of time."
Dr. Patel,Mad - gata - prāṇāḥ .,Prabhupāda," One cannot talk of Kṛṣṇa unless he is kṛṣṇa - gata - prāṇāḥ . Kṛṣṇa - gata - prāṇāḥ . Just like your loveable objects, you cannot forget even for a moment, similarly, one who has developed real love for Kṛṣṇa , he cannot do without thinking of Kṛṣṇa , without talking of Kṛṣṇa , without acting for Kṛṣṇa . Mad - gata - prāṇāḥ ."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. So therefore one who has taken to this... Sometimes these Māyāvādīs rascals say that the bhakti is meant for the less intelligent class of men. So how he can be less intelligent? Kṛṣṇa says, teṣāṁ satata - yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti - pūrvakam . So Kṛṣṇa personally gives you intelligence. So how He can be less intelligent?"
Dr. Patel,"He gives intelligence that, dadami buddhi - yogam .",Prabhupāda, Ah. And what kind of buddhi - yoga ?
Dr. Patel,"""By which you can reach Me.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. By which he can go back to home, back to Godhead. That kind of buddhi - yoga . Not this buddhi - yoga , how to exploit the whole world and become Hiranyakasipu."
Dr. Patel,"Nāśayāmy ātma - bhāva -stho, aham ajñāna - jaṁ tamaḥ . Tamaḥ nāśayāmy ātma - bhāva -stho.",Prabhupāda," Tamaḥ . No more ignorance, darkness. So how a devotee can be in darkness, in ignorance? This is refuted."
Dr. Patel,Now arjuna uvāca .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. So therefore, what is Kṛṣṇa , is to be understood from Arjuna . This is paramparā system. Paramparā system. Arjuna talked with Kṛṣṇa personally. So his experience is first-hand. So how this rascal can imagine of Kṛṣṇa , that ""Kṛṣṇa is like this, Kṛṣṇa is like that."" If you actually reading Bhagavad- gītā as Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa , you have to accept it. This is called paramparā . So what is the experience of Arjuna ? Arjuna said, ""You are, you are the Supreme Personality, puruṣam . You are not female. You are not prakṛti . You are puruṣa , śaśvata , and the original, śaśvatam , eternally."" Not that, the Māyāvādīs, ""Now impersonal..."" Yes, read one line. That is sufficient."
Dr. Patel,That same line. Puruṣaṁ śaśvataṁ divyam ādi - devam ajaṁ vibhum .,Prabhupāda," Ādi. Yes. Govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ . Ādi- puruṣam , He is the original person. Person. He is not imperson. Puruṣam is not imperson. Brahman is impersonal, but Paraṁ Brahman is not impersonal. That is Kṛṣṇa . So therefore it is called paraḥ , param . Brahman realization. Athāto brahma jijñāsā : ""You inquire about Brahman ."""
Dr. Patel,"All-pervading, vibhum .",Prabhupāda," Vibhum , yes, all-pervading. Just like the same example. The sun. The sun is all-pervading by sunshine, but still, sunshine is not important as the sun globe. This is to be understood. Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa ... Let us understand one line. Param Brahmān . Brahmān , sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma . But they are Parabrahman. Īśvara, everyone is īśvara . That's all right. But not everyone, Parameṣvara . Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bs. 5.1] ."
Dr. Patel,"Everyone is puruṣa , but not puruṣottama .",Prabhupāda," So paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma [Bg. 10.12 ] . Dhāma . Dhāma means resting place. Mat - sthāni sarva - bhūtāni [Bg. 9.4 ] . Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma , and pavitram . Pavitram means you are not contaminated by these material modes. Pavitraṁ paramam , Supreme. Now the question is that if Kṛṣṇa is paraṁ pavitra ... Now sometimes they criticize that ""Kṛṣṇa danced with the other girls. So how He can be contaminated?"""
Dr. Patel,Not contaminated.,Prabhupāda," Not contaminated. Apāpa- vidham . As it is said, apāpa vidham aśnaviram. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Aśnaviram means not material body. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa . Aśnaviram apāpa- vidham ."
Dr. Patel,Kavir manīṣiḥ paribhuḥ svayambhūḥ ...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is being explained, yes. Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān [Bg. 10.12 ] ."
Dr. Patel,Puruṣaṁ śaśvataṁ divyam ādi - devam ajaṁ vibhum .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Divyam . Divyam means spiritual. Tapo divyam . Tapo divyam [SB 5.5.1 ] . That is the instruction of Rsabhādeva, ""My dear boys, you engage yourself in tapasya . "" Now, what kind of tapasya ? Tapo divyam , for spiritual realization. Now, materialists, there are big, big scientists, big, big archeologists and so on, so on. They are also undergoing tapo . Without tapasya , nobody can become eminent. So they are also undergoing tapasya . Suppose one who has manufactured this atomic bomb. This is also tapasya . But not this kind of tapasya . Tapo divyam , for understanding Kṛṣṇa . To understand Kṛṣṇa , that tapasya required."
Dr. Patel,Shall I go further?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Now people may say that ""Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's friend, so he is eulogizing Kṛṣṇa like anything."" Therefore he is giving evidence that āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarva : ""It is not my sentiment that I am accepting you as such and such. But..."" (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa , Jaya . [break] He is giving evidence. This is required. This is required. If you say something, it must be supported by authorities. Not that my whimsically I say something like daridra nārāyaṇa ."
Dr. Patel,"Again you say, daridra - nārāyaṇa .",Prabhupāda, (laughs) Yes. Unauthorized statement. This will not be accepted. So āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve .
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Vyāsa . Ultimately Vyāsa .
Dr. Patel,"""Even You say so."" Svayam eva .",Prabhupāda," ""And You also say."""
Dr. Patel,"Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava , na hi te bhagavān vyaktiṁ ... [Bg. 10.14 ].",Prabhupāda," Now, this is understanding of Bhagavad- gītā , that ""Whatever you say, I accept as truth."" Not that ""This portion..."" Interpretation: ""This portion I don't like. This portion is nice."" No. Everything is nice. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, everything is correct. That is understanding."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Vyaktim means?,Prabhupāda," Vyaktim means his personality, personality, vyaktim ."
Dr. Patel,"""Nobody knows Your personality in truth.""",Prabhupāda, So foolish people cannot understand what is the Personality of Kṛṣṇa . Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore to understand You is to take information from You, not from others. What Kṛṣṇa says..."
Dr. Patel,Svayam evātmanātmānam.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because you know yourself, what you are. Nobody knows. Therefore to understand Kṛṣṇa , or God, is to accept whatever is spoken in the Bhagavad- gītā . That is real understanding."
Dr. Patel,Bhūta - bhāvana bhūteṣa deva -deva jagat - pate .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Vaktum arhasy aśeṣeṇa divyā hy ātma - vibhūtayaḥ .,Prabhupāda," Deva -deva. ""There are many demigods, but You are also..."""
Dr. Patel,Deva of the devas.,Prabhupāda," Ah. ""You are the supreme of all of them, deva -deva. You are worshiped by the devas."""
Dr. Patel,But he must have got special powers deputed to certain people. And these are that vibhūtis.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. That is vibhūti . That does not mean... Māyāvādī philosophy is: ""Because He has spread everywhere, therefore He is imperson."" He remains person, without any change, avyaya . But still, He is spread. That he is asking that ""How I shall understand You, that You are spread everywhere."" Akhilātma- bhūtaḥ . Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma- bhūtaḥ [Bs. 5.37] . That is... So we have to understand from Kṛṣṇa how He is all-pervading, not that mental speculation. ""Just like if you take a thing and distribute all over, the original thing is lost."" Not like that. Original Kṛṣṇa is there."
Dr. Patel,"Pūrṇam idam [Īśopaniṣad, Invocation] .",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. This is intelligence. How Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading, you have to learn from Kṛṣṇa and think like that. That is meditation. That is meditation, how Kṛṣṇa is all-per... Just like in the beginning also, Kṛṣṇa said, raso 'ham apsu kaunteya [Bg. 7.8 ] . So similarly, another explanation is going to be set up here."
Dr. Patel; Dr. Patel,Now; And the first important:,Prabhupāda," Yes, ady anta , this creation. Before this creation, Kṛṣṇa was there. Kṛṣṇa was there. When the creation is going on, it is maintained by Kṛṣṇa , and when it is dissolved, then it enters into Kṛṣṇa . Prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikam ."
Dr. Patel,Aham ātmā guḍākeśa sarva -bhūtāśaya- sthitaḥ .,Prabhupāda," ""And I am ātmā , Guḍākeśa . I am ātmā . Therefore, because My part and parcel is spreading, so that part and parcel, particle, that is the basic principle of everything."" Just like this body. This body is based on that part and particle, soul. Because the soul was there, the body has developed."
Dr. Patel,Otherwise body would perish. It does rot.,Prabhupāda," Yes. The body develops so long the ātmā is there. So similarly, because Kṛṣṇa is there, therefore whatever manifestation you see, that is due to Kṛṣṇa . Now here the latest theory of the rascals, that life has come from matter, is refuted."
Dr. Patel,"That is Carvaka's theory, this Karl Marx, the communists.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Now He says aham . Aham is living entity. So living entity is the origin of everything.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. Now, this is also another nice thing, that the modern astronomers, they say that all these stars are sun, sun. Do they not?"
Dr. Patel,Yes.,Prabhupāda," But just like Kṛṣṇa says, ""They are just like moon."" Just see. Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśi . So śaśi means the moon. Moon is like one of the stars. So if you say the stars are sūrya , then there is contradiction. How the moon and the sun can be equal? But actually, that is not. According to our Vedic astronomy, there is one sun only in one universe, although there are millions of universes, we cannot count. So there are millions of suns. That is another thing. But within the universe there is only one sun, and by the brilliance of sunshine, all these stars and moons are glittering. Just like moon shining, being reflected by the sun, similarly, all the stars they are glittering, being reflected by the sun, not that all of them are different suns. This theory is refuted."
Dr. Patel,By music. I am the soul of the music.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore hari - kīrtana . Hari - kīrtana is Sāma - veda , glorifying the supreme. That is stated in some other place. Yam brahma -varunendra- rudraḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair vedaiḥ sanga - pada -kramopa..."

Dr. Patel,Yajñānāṁ japa -yajño 'smi. (laughs),Prabhupāda," Yes. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ prayair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ [SB 11.5.32] . This is there. Japa - yoga , Hare Kṛṣṇa , this is the first-class..."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Now, the Kapila Muni . Who is that Kapila Muni ?"
Dr. Patel,That Devahūti's son.,Prabhupāda," Son, yes."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," King, king, king. Yes."
Dr. Patel,"King. But not these kings, (Hindi)",Prabhupāda," But they are not kings. They are mlecchas. They are not kings. Asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā - hīnā mlecchā rājendra - rūpinaḥ . They have assumed the post of king, but otherwise they are mlecchas, asaṁskṛtāḥ. There is no saṁskāra , and kriyā - hīnā , they do not perform the Vedic rituals. So they are all rascals. So how we can be happy?"
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Cupid.
Dr. Patel,"Reproduce, produces.",Prabhupāda," Yes, Cupid."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Jhaṣāṇām , ""Of all the aquatics, I am the makara ."""

Dr. Patel,Ahyātma- vidyā vidyānāṁ vādaḥ pravadatām aham .,Prabhupāda, Pravadatām aham .
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," The woman's voice is very attractive. Because people engage woman for singing. Their voice is naturally attractive. ""So that attractive voice, I am. I am."""
Dr. Patel,"Kīrtiḥ śrīr vāk ca nārīṇām , smṛtir medhā and dhṛtiḥ and kṣamā . These are the feminine qualities. ""There I am. I am kṣamā , I am dhṛtiḥ , I am medhā , I am smṛtir and I am the melodious sound of women. I am kīrtiḥ and I am śrīr.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Ah. (laughs) Pāṇḍavānāṁ dhanañjayaḥ .
Dr. Patel,"""I am you."" That means ""I am you.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Munīnām apy ahaṁ vyāsaḥ kavīnām uśanā kaviḥ .,Prabhupāda," Not ""I am you."" That is Māyāvāda . Dhanañjaya especially, not the rascals."
Dr. Patel,"""You"" means he is talking with whom? Dhanañjaya .",Prabhupāda," That's all right, Dhanañjaya . You can take, Dhanañjaya . Not that general people."
Dr. Patel,"But that is what He says, that ""I am you."" Kṛṣṇa says...",Prabhupāda," Not you, Dhanañjaya . ""You"" means... Why you are changing the word? No, no, it is said, Dhanañjaya . You say Dhanañjaya ."
Dr. Patel,"Pārtha , Dhanañjaya , He is...",Prabhupāda, Yes. And after...
Dr. Patel,But he is talking with Dhanañjaya .,Prabhupāda," That's all right. You cannot make it an impersonal. As soon as you say Dhanañjaya , He is person."
Dr. Patel,"Oh yes, that way. That way you are right. Vṛṣṇīnāṁ vāsudevo 'smi. That means He is the father of even Himself.",Prabhupāda," Yes, Vyāsadeva is incarnation of God."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Nītir, by argument, by logic, when one becomes victorious, that victory is Kṛṣṇa , nītī . Without Kṛṣṇa ..."
Chandobhai,"It is God's victory, not his.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Yac cāpi sarva - bhūtānāṁ bījaṁ tad aham arjuna . ""There is... Seed in everything is, I am.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, because everything is His energy."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," ""That is due to My influence, all these things."""
Dr. Patel,Aham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekeśena sthito jagat .,Prabhupāda," This is only ekāṁśa vibhūti . All this described, this is only one part. The three parts—in the spiritual world. This is all description of the material world. Now, this is only one part manifestation, and the three part manifestation—in the spiritual sky."
Chandobhai; Dr. Patel,Tri - pāda ... (Hindi); This thing. Today is Ekādaśī .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Moha , moho 'yam... ""What you were, now I have lost. I was thinking that you are an ordinary friend, but now that moha is gone. I understand You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," No, why trouble? Kṛṣṇa knows everything."
Dr. Patel,For himself. Arjuna is creating trouble for himself.,Prabhupāda," No, he is creating trouble for himself because the rascals will represent that ""I am incarnation of God."" Therefore Arjuna is asking him, ""Now show me your virāṭ - rūpa . "" So these rascals, bewildered by these so-called gods, they should ask, ""Show me your virāṭ - rūpa . Then I shall accept you."" That is the process. Not that ""I am incarnation of God."" How you become incarnation? Just lift one hill. Or show me virāṭ - rūpa . Or show me that you have sixteen thousand wives and you are maintaining them in sixteen thousand palaces. Then you call yourself that ""I am incarnation of Kṛṣṇa ."" Otherwise, you rascal, I cannot believe you. For them. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa ... He knows what is Kṛṣṇa , but because in future some rascal will come and will say that ""I am incarnation of God,"" therefore it is a warning that before accepting one rascal as incarnation, you ask him to show virāṭ - rūpa ."
Dr. Patel,"Even the pastime, rūpa vi ... (?)",Prabhupāda," Yes. But he wanted to see the virāṭ - rūpa . Therefore he said, ""If you think that I shall be able to see, then You can give me."""
Dr. Patel,Shall I read further?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Śrī bhagavān uvāca , paśya me pārtha rūpāṇi śataśo 'tha... [BG. 11.5 ]",Prabhupāda," So it was not difficult for him. Immediately He showed him. That is Kṛṣṇa . Not that ""I shall show you some day privately."""
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Just like mother Yaśodā saw within the mouth of Kṛṣṇa the whole universe.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Ah. ""Because you are not accustomed to see this virāṭ form, therefore I give you special vision to see it."""
Dr. Patel; Dr. Patel,; One of the features of His multiple features.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Virāṭ - rūpa . Not that the... Māyāvādīs take the virāṭ - rūpa is the origin, and this rūpa , Kṛṣṇa , that is māyā . Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. But actually, Hari manifested or exhibited..."
Dr. Patel,One of his multiple...,Prabhupāda, Multiple features.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Arjuna uvāca . These boys understand this, all of them?",Prabhupāda," Yes. No, I will explain."
Dr. Patel,"Now Arjuna says, paśyāmi devāṁs tava deva dehe sarvāṁs tathā bhūta - viśeṣa ...",Prabhupāda," Devāṁs, devāṁs, tava deva dehe means ""devas, the demigods, they are part and parcel of Your virāṭa - rupa . "" They are not independent. Just like this finger is part of my this whole body, similarly, all these devas, these demigods... That is explained previously. Ye 'py anya - devatā bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ, te 'pi mām eva . If you give something to my finger, that is to be given to my body, but that is avidhi - pūrvakam . The thing's to be given to the mouth, not in the hand. But their logic is, because everything is the same, why not here? That is Māyāvāda . Yes."
Dr. Patel,Kamalāsana- stham ṛṣīṁṣ sarvān urugāṁṣ ca divyān . All wonderful things.,Prabhupāda," Now even in His virāṭ - rūpa , He is person, kirīṭina. He has got helmet. Kirīṭina. Then?"
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda," Yes. Must be frightened. Now, suppose all of a sudden, if you see a very big person, you will not be frightened? Because you are not accustomed to see that."
Dr. Patel,Anādi -madhyāntam ananta - vīryam ananta - bāhuṁ śaśi - sūrya - netram paśyāmi tvāṁ dīpta - hutāśa - vaktraṁ ... [Bg. 11.19 ],Prabhupāda," Now here is one important thing: śaśi - sūrya - netram . The śaśi , the moon, and the sun are the two eyes of God. Now in Brahma - saṁhitā it is also confirmed yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala - grahāṇām . So in the Upaniṣads it is said, ""When God sees, then you can see."" So this... When the sunrise is there, that means when God sees, you can see. In the darkness you cannot see. And still, you are proud of your eyes. Yes. Without God seeing, you cannot see. And still, these rascals are proud of their eyes. ""I can... Can you show me?"" How you can see? First of all you have to see through the Supreme. And another significance is that you cannot hide yourself from the seeing of the Supreme. You cannot make anything hiding. Because even in the womb there is sunshine, sunlight. So He is seeing there. Apart from being the Paramātmā , from materially also, His eyes are always there. So you cannot do anything hiding. That is not possible."
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, So everyone is worshiping Him.
Dr. Patel,,Prabhupāda, They do not understand. If you go on simply reading...
Dr. Patel,"But you say read, so I read. You order me, I stop.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,Shall I read again?,Prabhupāda, What is that line?
Dr. Patel,There are so many lines. I will again. Aneka divya ... Divi - sūrya - sahasrasya bhaved yugapad utthitā ...,Prabhupāda," Ah, this is the comparison now, that divi , ""In the sky, if there were thousands of suns at a time, then the brilliance of the virāṭ - rūpa could be understood."" This is an example."
