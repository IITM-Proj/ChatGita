Gurudāsa,Yes. I used to cook myself before meeting Yamunā .,Prabhupāda," Long, long ago?"
Gurudāsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, And it was very nice?
Gurudāsa,"It was nonsense, but I enjoyed it.",Prabhupāda," In India amongst the brāhmaṇas, this self cooking is very much (indistinct)."
Gurudāsa,"I think it... (break) ... prasādam in a very simple way. When you cook yourself, very simple.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (break)
Gurudāsa,"... Rādhā - Dāmodara , did you cook yourself?",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Gurudāsa,Sarajini helped?,Prabhupāda," Sarajini simply washed the dishes, cleansed the room, set out the bedding. I was cooking. (break)"
Devotee (1),"Soviet, Soviet Land, I forget the exact title. And this one woman was a poet.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (1),"She was a poet. In one article in the magazine. And she was..., stated in her magazine how much she was sorry about her youth.",Prabhupāda, Youth.
Devotee (1),"Yeah, that she was living very poorly, and her father had to work all day very hard as a goldsmith or tinsmith. And how she remembers her mother, that she was kept in such poor conditions that all her life she was very miserable. And she said that she was thinking that her mother might have been a great poet or a great scientist, but because of being oppressed by the higher class of Russia that she could not develop, she simply was forced to live a very poor life. So I was able to understand that actually they are thinking that being oppressed by the higher classes, the lower class cannot properly develop their qualities.",Prabhupāda," That is a fact. But this higher class and lower class will continue to exist. Even it is existing in communistic countries. That cannot..., you cannot stop in this material world. The tendency is that everyone is thinking that he shall be the best enjoyer, best enjoyer. So this is called struggle for existence. Naturally, this higher class and lower class will remain. You cannot stop it. Even in communistic country, this Khrushchev was driven away. He was taking all advantages for his family, for himself. As soon as he got the post, he misused it. He gave his son-in-law very big post, his family members. That was detected, and he was charged that ""You are using your influence, nepotism."" Therefore, he was driven away. So this natural tendency, as soon as one gets power, he will try to utilize it. This psychology you cannot stop in the material world. That is not possible. That sacrificing spirit, that ""My life is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa ,"" then it is possible. Otherwise, as soon as one will get some position and power, he will try to utilize it for his personal benefit. How you can stop it? It is like if you try to make the lion nonviolent. Is it possible? Why lion? Even an ant is violent. Even an ant it is violent. As soon as it gets opportunity, it will bite you. So this tendency of artificial supremacy means material life. That is material life. So how you can stop it? That separation is going on. You see in the spiritual life also. My Godbrothers, they are trying to suppress me. They are writing articles that in foreign countries these things..., Ratha - yātrā is going on, so many temples have been, but they will never mention my name. They have suppressed. They want to... They write articles in such a way that Bon Mahārāja has done so much and they have done so much, and my name is not mentioned. This spirit, ""Oh, this man is going so high."" Therefore, Bhāgavata says nirmatsarāṇām . You know the meaning of nirmatsarāṇām ?"
Devotee (1),"""Without envy""?",Prabhupāda," Yes. The whole world is envious, whole world. I am envious of you, you are envious of me. That Bhāgavata is not meant for such envious persons. Paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB 1.1.2 ] , those who are no more envious. How they will have a devotee envious? He loves Kṛṣṇa and in relationship with Kṛṣṇa loves everyone. In that position, in that state, one will not try to suppress another. Otherwise, it is material life. To live at the cost of others, to suppress one, to take other's money and become rich. There is story in the Aesop's Fable that—you perhaps know it—that a dog took the flesh in his mouth and was crossing a river, and the shadow was in the water. So he thought there is another dog with the flesh, so he wanted to..., he lost this, and that was a shadow. So he has got a flesh in his mouth, but he is an animal, it was deluded that ""Another dog is carrying, so I shall take."" So even in the cats and dogs, this tendency is there. Even the cats and dogs, they are also. So how can you stop it? That will be not stopped. They do not know. Therefore, these theories, they are simply theories; they are not practical. They do not know what is the nature, how nature is working."
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, You have seen?
Devotee (2),They have a pyramid?,Prabhupāda," Yes, they have brought."
Devotee (1),"It's a long obelisk that are there, brought from Egypt.",Prabhupāda," And in the British Museum you will find so many things plundered from here, plundered from here. In the Rome , they are also maintaining such museums, and Paris I saw. This is their competition—wholesale plundering, wholesale plundering."
Devotee (2),They take it... (break),Prabhupāda," We take that it is a competition of the thieves. All rascals. That's not the civilization. And Mahābhārata history also we find so many demons. Just like..., what is called, that asura , he simply plundered all the beautiful princesses."
Devotee (2),Bhaumāsura?,Prabhupāda," Bhaumāsura, something like that. They all of them became Kṛṣṇa's wife. They prayed to Kṛṣṇa to be rescued from the hands of... Then Kṛṣṇa rescued them, killed that Bhaumāsura, and excused them, then they were set free. Then their plea that ""We are set free, that's all right, but we cannot go home because we were kidnapped. So we shall not be married. Nobody will accept us."" ""Then what do you want?"" ""You become our husband."" ""All right."" Kṛṣṇa becomes (indistinct). This is going on. Somebody is thinking of money, somebody is thinking of woman. These two things, money and woman, and whole struggle (indistinct). The Musselman nawabs , they used to keep... That one nawab, they have got his quarters in Lucknow, he had 160 wives. Even in recent, you know this (name withheld)? His elder brother, (name withheld), practically he is the origin of the (name withheld) concern. So I was a guest of the (indistinct). So he has got three wives—one Bengali wife, one (indistinct) wife, and his original wife being Jain. He had three, four wives. And each wife's establishment, ten thousand rupees per month. So he is earning money and he is spending it. Earning money by black market, this way, that way, and his whole day's business is that go to some wife's house, remain there for some hours, then next wife, remain there for some hours, and he thinks, ""I am a king."" Still he is living. He is of my age, old man. And each wife has got dozens of children. They're not his."
Devotee (2),He cannot keep them satisfied.,Prabhupāda," How it is possible? He's an old man and the wives are young. But they have got dozens of children, and he is trying to give each child five lakhs of rupees. That is to keep the wife. Everyone is trying that. Natural affection, beget children as many as you like, and then bring money and give them. That is (indistinct). This is that heart disease. How you can stop it? The rascals, they do not know it cannot be done. The lower class, still they are maintaining. Manager class, the worker class. That is going on. That higher and lower level must continue in the material world. You cannot stop it. Individually, nationally, communally."
Devotee (1),They have simply taken the sides of the low class against the upper class.,Prabhupāda, That is a sympathy. But you cannot change it. That is not possible. It is very good sympathy.
Devotee (1),"This poet, in her poetry, her business was to try to create that sentiment.",Prabhupāda," (Sanskrit) He is not poet. Poet means he must have full knowledge. Then if he writes poetry, that will be beneficial. The rascal's poetry, just like in your country, one line, three lines, one line. This is rascaldom; it is not poetry. (aside:) You should not show your feet before the Deity. That is possible only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We teach our men to address his fellow man as prabhu : ""You are master, I am servant."" In the material world, everyone is trying to become master; nobody is trying to become servant. And we are teaching that you try to become servant. Just the opposite. Nobody will agree. Therefore, they say the Vaiṣṇava religion is slave mentality. They say. They do not know that it is success of life to become slave of Kṛṣṇa . They do not know. Who has become happy trying to become master? (indistinct)"
Devotee (2),They'll all be cheated.,Prabhupāda," No, not a single person. Actually he remains slave, artificially he thinks that ""I am master."" Just like Nixon was thinking. He was actually slave of the nation, but he was thinking, ""I am master."" When he was pressed too much, he had to admit, ""Yes, I am your slave."" He was pressed. Rather, oppressed. Nobody is thinking. Idam adya mayā labdham imaṁ prāpsye punar dhanam . Everyone is thinking, ""I have got now so much money (indistinct) ...lot of money, so who is better than me?"" (indistinct) She has become poet. Nonsense number one, and she is poet. Does not know the human psychology or animal psychology. The human psychology, animal psychology, that you have seen on the road, the sex. The animal does not require any education. The animal knows how to use sex; the man knows how to use sex. Where is the difference? Simply she is animal, she does the sex intercourse in a public street, animal (indistinct) an apartment, very nice apartment (indistinct). It is (indistinct), either you are dog or a human being, the fact is. He also sleeps. He sleeps on the street anywhere, and we sleep in a nice apartment. He also eats, and the human being also eats. He eats the stool and we eat very nice, palatable foodstuff. That sleeping propensity is there, sex life is there, and he is also afraid of enemies. Where is the difference? Difference is that dog cannot be taught Kṛṣṇa consciousness but a man can be taught. That is the difference. So if man does not take advantage of this human life, how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he is no better than a dog. He has no (indistinct)"
Devotee (1),So her poetry is just like the braying of the ass.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1),Her poetry was just like the braying of the ass.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Thinking, simply imagining that they shall be happy in this way. And accusing others. You cannot become happy in that way, that he will accuse, ""He is the cause. He is the impediment of my perfect happiness."" Envious, the same enviousness."
Devotee (2),"Therefore, let me eliminate you.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Same enviousness. Nirmatsarata (?). Yayā sammohito jīva .
Brahmānanda; Gurudāsa; Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Here comes Gurudāsa. (break); (making notes on tape) Morning, 11 September, 1974, Vṛndāvana . Śrīla Prabhupāda was saying that manager and assisting managers is not difficult, except that all the European and American boys didn't understand the concept of prabhu . We each call each other prabhu , but we are thinking that ""I am prabhu and all others are servants."" Not that the one I am calling prabhu or the one who is calling me prabhu are mutual prabhus. (break); Brahmānanda : He's typing the tapes now. To type one tape takes him about eight hours.",Prabhupāda, Eight hours?
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, How is that?
Brahmānanda; Devotee (1),Brahmānanda : That is the usual time.; It's not possible.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1); Brahmānanda; Devotee (1); Brahmānanda,It's not possible to take so long.; Brahmānanda : But he puts the Bengali and the Sanskrit in.; They were telling me three to four hours.; Brahmānanda : Who?,Prabhupāda," (break) Caitanya - caritāmṛta and Bhāgavata is being accepted everywhere. Big, big libraries, universities. University, Bombay University. As far as possible (indistinct) all colleges. (break) There is no (indistinct) word meaning, word-to-word meaning (indistinct). When there is word... (break) You should be clear of all questions possible. Then you will be able to push very forcibly. You must be prepared to answer all the questions."
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Prabhupāda, one question: You say that Kṛṣṇa consciousness will solve all problems. But factually, there are so many problems in the world that aren't being solved.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : So many problems in the world, and many say that they can solve all the problems. So what is the proof?",Prabhupāda, They could not. The problems are there.
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Sometimes we are criticized. They say, ""Oh, you say you can solve all problems. That is utopian, that is...""",Prabhupāda," Not utopian. You do not know. Because just like when you are diseased, there is problem. So to solve that problem, where do you go? Hm?"
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : To the doctor.,Prabhupāda," To the qualified physician, not to the storekeeper. Similarly, first thing is, when you want to solve the problem, you must go to the right person. First of all you have to select. So we understand that Kṛṣṇa is the right person. So therefore, it is guaranteed. He knows everything. Others, they do not know. May know to some extent, not perfect. The first thing is that we have to select from whom. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . In Vedas it is stated in order to solve the problem or to understand the situation, you should go to the guru . So who can be better than Kṛṣṇa as guru ? He taught, He gave lessons to Brahmā , the original living creature in this universe. Tene brahma hṛdā . He gave lessons to Brahmā how to create. Therefore, who can be better guru than Kṛṣṇa ? Or even Brahmā . Brahmā , (indistinct) he has created this universe, but He taught Brahmā . And Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the supreme guru . To take instruction from Him or His pure representative, that is wanted. Otherwise, there will be trouble(?). You cannot compare any ordinary person with Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa is the original guru , instructor. You do not know about Kṛṣṇa , that is a different thing. But if you want to solve your problems, you must approach the guru . That is the Vedic instruction. Tad -vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12] . This verb is used when you must: no excuse, gacchet , vidhiliṅ . In Sanskrit there are different forms of verb. So when vidhiliṅ is used, that means you must. There is no question of alternative. You must. So Kṛṣṇa is the original guru . Tene brahma ādi - kavaye , ādi - kavi . Ādi- kavaye means ādi - kavi , the original learned scholar. How much brain he has that he has created this universe, Brahmā . He has created the demigods, he has created the planets, so who can (indistinct)? And he was instructed by Kṛṣṇa . So who can be a better guru than Him? And so far you are concerned, you cannot (indistinct). You have not solved any question. Therefore required, they say, revolution. Problem is not solved. We are accepting one wrong process, and after going through it for some time, we want to change it. That is not solution. That means you do not know how to make it solved; you're simply trying this method, that method, this method, that method. That is (indistinct). That is not perfect. But because you cannot solve, therefore you say that the periodical revolution is required, because you have no solution. You do not know how to solve, but you accept some process for some time, and when you see it is useless, you make revolution, another (indistinct). This is punaḥ punaś carvita - carvaṇānām [SB 7.5.30 ] . Practically we see that. There is sex. Material life means sex pleasure. You told me you were in Mexico, in the street they are having sex?"
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Yes. Oh, meaning in public?",Prabhupāda," Yes, you told me."
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : They have it with..., you mean with the asses?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Public street. Because they do not know except sex, they think this kind of sex is very nice. Punaḥ punaś carvita - carvaṇānām : [SB 7.5.30 ] chewing the chewed."
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : They're not satisfied with sex with a man, so they have it with an ass.",Prabhupāda," Their center is sex—this sex or that sex or that sex, even ordinarily. In Paris, Paris you know it is a city of prostitutes. On the roads there are prostitutes. Where we have got our temple, so many prostitutes are standing. And those who are prostitute-hunter, they go to Paris. From our childhood I know about one family physician. We are at that time boy, 8 or 10 years old. He was talking with his another Muhammadan friend how he toured many countries and how many different types of prostitutes he tasted. This was his talk. So he was talking of Paris, ""Though you are boy...,"" this we could understand."" This is the talk. Old men, retired men, they will also talk of the sex (indistinct), and they will enjoy. Now they could not enjoy sex, but by talking... And we have practically seen when we were young, our grandmother-in-law, my mother-in-law's mother, old lady, she would talk freely about sex. She will ask me, ""You capture the breast of your wife."" She would make a pun and enjoy. ""You do like that, you do like that."" She teaches like that. We were... I was twenty, twenty-three years, so I was just married, but she will enjoy sex. She had other grandchildren. My father-in-law were two brothers. So my father-in-law, he was younger brother, and his elder brother, her daughter also the same age, she would enjoy (indistinct) son-in-law. (break) Ministers, prime ministers. The minister, famous."
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : (indistinct),Prabhupāda," (indistinct) So Akbar (indistinct) asked Birbal, ""What is your idea of sex life? How long it continues?"" He answered, ""Up to the point of death."" ""No, no. I don't believe it."" ""All right."" So one day all of a sudden Birbal came to Akbar (indistinct) house, ""Sir, you have to go with me immediately with your youngest daughter."" So Akbar (indistinct)'s daughter, king's daughter, very (indistinct). So the father and the daughter and Birbal went to see one dying man. The man was dying, and he asked, Birbal (indistinct) that ""You simply see his face."" So when he was entering, that man was looking to that young girl, not the Akbar (indistinct). He was looking over that young girl. Both of them were intelligent. Then Akbar (indistinct) said, ""Yes."" And our śāstra says yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45 ] . What is the happiness of the gṛhastha life? Gṛhastha is different, gṛhamedhi . There are two words. Gṛhastha means living husband and wife together, but the aim is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And gṛhamedhi means he has no Kṛṣṇa consciousness; therefore his life is sex. That is the difference. Therefore, this word is used, gṛhamedhi . Yan maithunādi. What is the standard of happiness? Maithu, sex, that's all. Yan maithunādi. All these gṛhasthas, you will find they are accumulating money, they are enjoying sex life, then daughter's sex life, son's sex life, grandson's sex life. They are busy. Especially in India you will find, they spend thousands lakhs of rupees for son's and daughter's and grandson's sex life. Is it not? That is their happiness. ""I am enjoying sex life."" Just like my grandmother-in-law. She is concentrating on sex life. She was old, she had no opportunity. Let grandson-in-law, granddaughter. One who is impotent, he wants to see others enjoying sex life. You know this? He enjoys. He cannot do it. There are many persons, he is impotent, so he brings another man to his wife, then he watches. You know this? This is going on. Sex. They will see the dog's sex life, very (indistinct), how he is enjoying. Cow's sex life. Dog is having sex, and there will be crowd. This is the basic principle of material life: sex. In this way, prostitution, this way, that way, that way, that way, this is the only point. There is no other aim. Yan maithunadi- grhamedhi - sukham hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45 ] . And this kind of happiness is most abominable. Most abominable. But that is the center of life. Is it not? Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham . Most abominable part of the body for passing urine, obnoxious smell, but that is the point of life. How much degraded this material life. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ . The śāstra has picked up most abominable thing: that is the point of pleasure. Yan maithunādi. Maithunādi, either he himself, or for his son, for his grandson, for his great-grandson, the family. Very aristocratic."
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Mirabhai is becoming mixed up with Kṛṣṇa . You have seen it?
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Yes, that was the final point. She worshiped Kṛṣṇa throughout her whole life so at the end she could become one with Him.",Prabhupāda," This is going on, the Māyāvādī rascals. But they do not refer where Kṛṣṇa says that ""You become My devotee, then you become pushed (indistinct)."""
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : They showed the two bodies coming together.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : I think the picture of the two bodies...,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa says that ""You and Me and all these soldiers, we existed before, we are existing now, and we shall exist in this way in the future."" Where does He say that ""We shall be mixed up""? He never says. And these rascals, they have got so many parties, the same thing. Where do you get this idea? There is sayujya - mukti , but Kṛṣṇa never says that ""You take it."" All this Ramakrishna Mission, all these, this (indistinct), he gives the example that rivers come from different sources, but when it comes to the ocean it is mixed up. Why don't you see within the water? Within the water there are big, big fishes, they do not mix up with the water. They see superficially the water. This is going on. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās [SB 7.5.31 ] . Our philosophy is ""Come. Come here, play with Kṛṣṇa as cowherd boy. Come here, dance with Kṛṣṇa as gopī . Come here, accept Kṛṣṇa as your son, Kṛṣṇa will accept you as His mother."" There will be always two, and enjoy, any way. Even as enemy, demon displaying part of enemy, Kṛṣṇa killing, that is also pastime too. That is also enjoyment. Just like sometimes we fight, friend to friend, to enjoy life, because fighting is enjoyment. You become enemy of Kṛṣṇa purposefully, and to fight with Him, that is giving pleasure to Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa is enjoying, and He also becomes so staunch enemy. So this is also transcendental pleasure. Just like Bhīṣma . He is piercing the body of Kṛṣṇa , and He is coming with cakra . That is a pleasure. Kṛṣṇa is enjoying being pierced by His devotee. And devotee is enjoying, ""Now Kṛṣṇa is coming to kill me."" So any way you can deal with Kṛṣṇa and enjoy transcendental pleasure, either as enemy or as friend or as son or as lover, as master, as a servant—any way. Kṛṣṇa is prepared to deal with you any way, in twelve rasas, akhila - rasāmṛta - sindhu . Raso vai saḥ , in the Vedas, He is the reservoir of all pleasure, transcendental. (Sanskrit) When we exchange rasa , transcendental mellow, (Sanskrit), then we get transcendental bliss. As the materialist has centered around the sex, this way or that way, similarly the transcendentalists, they are..., their center is Kṛṣṇa . That is the difference. So if you want to enjoy life making Kṛṣṇa as the center, that is eternal happiness. And this life means it is not eternal. Now you enjoy sex as human being, next as dog, next as monkey, next as flies, next as this, next as that. The center is sex, but you have to change according to your mental condition at the time of death in different body. That is not eternal. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. 8.19 ] . You accept one type of body, enjoy sex according to that body, then you can accept another body. Sex life is there. As human being, sex life; and as a dog, there is sex life; as a fly, sex life. Fly also enjoys sex life. You have seen?"
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : Yes, in (indistinct).",Prabhupāda, The center is sex. The birds.
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : The birds are also.,Prabhupāda, Everyone.
Devotee (2),The Myth of Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Rascal, sex life. Rādhārāṇī naked, he has given the first picture, and that is published by the United Nations."
Gurudāsa,The United Nations is also encouraging sex.,Prabhupāda," They do not know except this thing, anyone. Anyone. They have no other desire. That without sex life there can be higher transcendental, eternal pleasure, they do not know it. Whole world, whole universe, whole material creation is centered around that. It is the pivot. That I have already explained. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45 ] . That is there. They do not know anything else."
Brahmānanda,"Brahmānanda : That was one of your first instructions to me when I came to see you. I was telling you about a professor, one of my professors who saw that all literature, all culture, all poetry, everything was simply motivated by sex life, and you said that he was right. I thought he was wrong, but you said no, he was right, and you explained about the same point.",Prabhupāda," Therefore the Freud's philosophy is centered around sex. They do not know. How they can know? Only the Kṛṣṇa conscious person, that is yad - avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa -pādāravinde nava -nava-dhāmany udyatam . Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he was a young man. Beautiful young prostitute at dead of night came to canvass. ""Yes, sit down. I shall finish this Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" So Haridāsa Ṭhākura took his compassion, ""This woman has come to me. All right."" Three days she became purified. Immediately fell down, ""Thank you very much. Now I can understand."" ""Now you have to sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" (end)"
