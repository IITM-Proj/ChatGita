Bhagavān,Bhagavān : So I hope there is still time.,Prabhupāda, He is Prime Minister of France?
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : He just became the Prime Minister of France.,Prabhupāda, Hm. Young man?
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : Forty? [break] (now they are walking),Prabhupāda," Still they are doing this. You see? Padaṁ padam means every step. There are some fruits in this tree? No. Oh, here is eucalyptus? No. [break] ...you can by children, their living. There is only one offspring. (end)"
Yogeśvara; Bhagavān; Yogeśvara; Devotee; Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Claude Monet?; Bhagavān : Picasso.; Yogeśvara : No, he's Spanish.; Leonardo da Vinci.; Yogeśvara : He's Italian.",Prabhupāda, Yes. It is said that he was very poor man. So he painted in a fruitshop grapes.
Devotees,Cezanne.,Prabhupāda," Ah. So the crows came to pick up the grapes, and the king was passing, he picked up, ""Oh, who is that artist?"" He became rich man in association. No, I have seen in that hall. So first-class picture. I have never seen such nice picture. Exactly life. [break]"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : ...the book glorifying the Russian ideals, he is thrown out of the country.",Prabhupāda," Just see. It is a country... People are not bad. I have seen. They are very nice. The government, the rascals, a few men, who are controlling the government, they are all rogues and thieves. The same thing in India. Everywhere mass population, they are innocent. These rascals made them..., misleading. In Russia I have seen. The mass people, they are very nice. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB 7.5.31 ] . They are innocent. In India also. The Pakistan happened due to these politicians. The Hindus, Muslims, they are innocent. They don't fight. These politicians engaged them to fight artificially for their political ambition. The wars also declared nowadays, on account of the rascal politicians. The people do not want it. [break] ...to the Indian railway strike , have you got any news?"
Bhagavān; Karandhara,Bhagavān : It ceased the other day.; They made some agreement with the union.,Prabhupāda, Government made agreement.
Karandhara; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Yeah, they made some compromise with the union.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : It seems that the government had arrested all of the union leaders, and this paralyzed the worker's appeal. So the workers finally agreed to go back. They put many thousands of union leaders into jail.",Prabhupāda, It was right. [break]
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : ...did in such a way that crops can be grown anywhere? Can crops be grown anywhere in the world?,Prabhupāda," Yes. If it does not grow, then what is nature's arrangement?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Well, for example, there are some parts in India that are too dry to cultivate the ground.",Prabhupāda," Dry means there is no rain. If natures like, there can be profuse rain. That is nature's arrangement. That is stated in the Bhagavad- gītā . Parjanyād anna - sambhavaḥ . Parjanyāt . You must have sufficient rain. And for having sufficient rain, you must execute yajña . Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. 3.14 ] . So these people are now becoming rascals. They are not performing yajñas. They are opening slaughterhouse. How there will be rain? Instead of performing yajñas, they are opening big, big slaughterhouse."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : I think now in many parts of the world the desert is increasing.,Prabhupāda," Yes, desert will increase."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : So under the present conditions, it's necessary to transport food. At least, for the time being, we don't have the possibility of growing food anywhere and everywhere. So some transportation of food is required.",Prabhupāda," Where you get for transportation if there is no grain? If you say there is no hope of producing food grain, then where is the chance of transportation?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Well, in some areas there is.",Prabhupāda," In somewhere. If somewhere it is produced, then other place also it can be produced. You perform yajña , saṅkīrtana - yajña . You will get enough food. Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ , parjanyād anna - sambhavaḥ , annād bhavanti bhutānī [Bg. 3.14 ] . So in Switzerland there are many slaughterhouses also? Many?"
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : Some time ago I read in the papers that they had so much milk and so much butter that the government proposal was kill the cows.,Prabhupāda," Kill all the animals. Oh, just see. They will not give to others."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : The farmers were complaining that their prices weren't competitive cause there was so much milk.,Prabhupāda," The price is the standard, not that goods are required. They want money for purchasing wine. This is the difficulty. They are not satisfied simply by eating sufficient. They want money for woman and wine. This is their philosophy."
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : In the United States that same problem was there, that the prices were all going up. Everything was having inflation.",Prabhupāda," So if they had sense, they should have exported where there is necessity of this milk, butter, grain. Then the world will be happy."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : That was my question. If there is necessity for exporting, then there is necessity for maintaining ships and trains and means of communication, employing workers, electrical dynamos for running...",Prabhupāda," No, point is if in one place you can produce food grains, butter and milk, why not other place? That is my point. The land is everywhere the same. If one place... Now here, in Europe and America, there is enough production because the population is less. So the whole America is bigger than India, at least four times. And the population is not even half. What is the population whole America?"
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : 200,000,000.",Prabhupāda, And India?
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : About 600,000,000.",Prabhupāda," Just see. And the land is four times more than India, at least. Therefore you find excess. You see? Otherwise, India is also producing. No, India is not producing. It is not utilizing all the land."
Guru-gaurāṅga,"Guru - gaurāṅga : If the people here are so sinful, how is it that they have so many nice facilities? It will go away soon, very soon.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. As they increase their sinful activities, these facilities will be taken away. Therefore we propose that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa , and we are all sons of Kṛṣṇa . Just cooperate in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the whole world will be happy. This is our proposal. Why do you think it is American, it is Swiss, it is Indian? Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa . Let us become obedient to Kṛṣṇa , and because we are sons of Kṛṣṇa , let us enjoy the property of Kṛṣṇa . Immediately there will be happiness. I have several times said that the, still the whole world can produce so much grains and foodstuff, ten times of the population can be fed, ten times. In Africa, in Australia, and even in America, so much, I means, prospect of producing food. But they will not cooperate. They will kill the animal. They will throw the grain to the sea, and claim, ""It is my land. It is my property."""
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : Then they complain about scarcity.,Prabhupāda," For money. So rascal civilization is going on. Therefore I challenged that man, ""Where is your brain?"" There is no brain. You remember that?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : From the International Labor Organization.,Prabhupāda, Yes. There is no brain.
Karandhara,"Prabhupāda, in a recent study by U.S. Agricultural officials, they found that it is really uneconomical to eat meat. It takes so much energy and man hours to raise and transport and slaughter the cows that it makes it very wasteful.",Prabhupāda," Wasteful, yes. Therefore I say they have no brain. All, they are rascals. Rascal leaders. A little labor in agriculture will be sufficient to produce the family's food stock for the whole year. You can stock. You work only three months, and you get sufficient food for your whole family. And less nine months, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa . But these rascals will not do that. They will work hard like ass simply for eating. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya -prītaya āpṛṇoti [SB 5.5.4 ] . They will not accept easy life."
Guru-gaurāṅga,"Guru - gaurāṅga : In that agricultural report it said that if they were to eat all the grains that they give to the cows and animals, they could get twenty times more calories than by eating meat.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Wrong civilization, rascal civilization. And this is due to this rascaldom, nationalism, ""This is my land."" And at any moment he will be kicked out. Still, he claims, ""It is my land."" Ahaṁ mameti, janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti [SB 5.5.8 ] . This is the illusion. Nothing belongs to him; still he is fighting, ""This is mine. This is mine."" ""I"" and ""mine."" Identifying himself with this body, ""I"", and wrongly conceiving that ""This is mine."" This is the basic principle of wrong civilization. Both things are... Nothing belongs to him. Suppose I have come here in Switzerland. If I remain here for one month and I claim, ""Oh, this is mine,"" what is this? So similarly, I come as guest. Everyone comes as guest in the womb of his mother and lives here for fifty years. He is claiming, ""It is mine."" When, when, when it became yours? The land was long, long time before your birth. How it became yours? But they have no sense. ""It is mine."" ""Fight."" ""My land, my nation, my family, my society."" In this way, wasting time. These things have been introduced by these western mlecchas. In the Vedic civilization there is no such thing as nationalism. You won't find. Have you seen in the Bhagavad- gītā any word, ""nationalism?"" No such thing. This is the original ideas of the tribes. In the jungle there is... Just like in Africa there are still groups of tribes. This is most crude idea of civilization, nationalism. This is tribalized. It is nothing but development of just tribalism. And eating also the same. They are not advanced in civilization. This nationalism is another form of tribalism, that's all."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : They are actually just cannibals because they maintain themselves on eating the cow.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : They think it's so horrible to eat another person, but...",Prabhupāda," Yes. And they are suffering. Therefore you'll find, in the recent history, every twenty-five years there is a big war, slaughter, mass slaughtering of the people. How nature will tolerate? Now India has learned, imitated the western countries. Now there is war between India and Pakistan. Otherwise there was no such thing. During two wars between the Pakistan and Hindustan, unnecessarily, without any profit, millions of people were killed."
Karandhara,"Just recently India exploded an atomic bomb, and now Pakistan is hurrying to get an atomic bomb also.",Prabhupāda, Yes. This is going on.
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : The government promised it would be only for peaceful purposes.,Prabhupāda," No, what do they know about peaceful conditions. They are all rascals. They do not know what is peaceful condition. Actually peaceful condition is described in the Bhagavad- gītā ,"
Satsvarūpa,"Embracing. Men and women and child, too.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Yogeśvara(?),Yogeśvara (?): Merged.,Prabhupāda, Merged into one. (laughter) Brahman realization. Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : We can turn back now.,Prabhupāda, Hm. This way or that way?
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : This way is all right.,Prabhupāda, Very nice park.
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : In the ancient tribal system, there was some form of religiosity. There was some form of worship of God. The so-called modern civilization doesn't even maintain that.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Their developed consciousness is being used for sense gratification. That's all. They have taken up, sense gratification is the highest aim of life. Hedonism. What is that hedonism?"
Karandhara,"Hedonism means to eat, sleep and be merry.",Prabhupāda, That's all.
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : When I was in school, I read that when the British went to Africa to colonize, the first thing they did... In the north there was a tribe called the Ashanti tribe. And the symbol of religion was an axe. Whoever possessed that axe was a leader. So the first thing they did was to import thousands and thousands of axes and they distributed them to everyone. In this way, they destroyed the religious sentiment and then introduced their own system.",Prabhupāda, Who first started this colonization? Britishers or the Spaniards?
Yogeśvara; Karandhara,"Yogeśvara : It was a Britisher.; Spaniards were, I think Portuguese.",Prabhupāda, Portuguese. Because they had very small land.
Karandhara,They were navigators.,Prabhupāda, So find out some place.
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : The boy didn't realize the potency of your answer last night. He was asking how to fight fascism, and you were saying by chanting and dancing. So factually, by setting the example is the greatest way to fight all these maladies.",Prabhupāda," Māyā . Māyā . Yes, we are fighting with this Māyic civilization."
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : Because they can fight with guns, but afterwards neither one of them knows how to set an exemplary life. So they just keep fighting with guns.",Prabhupāda," With gun or without, gun, you will die. The fascist will die and the other party also will die. Gun or without gun, he cannot exist. But our fight is to stop death. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. 4.9 ] . Our fight is for this purpose, no more death. This is real fight. Your, what is your fight? You may save yourself for two years or three years or ten years, but you have to die. You have no such program not to die. But here is a program, no more death."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : They have one program. They are freezing bodies.,Prabhupāda, (laughs) That is another nonsense.
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Then they will defrost them in fifty or one hundred years.,Prabhupāda, All future programs.
Nitāi; Yogeśvara,"Nitāi : They have never done that, have they?; Yogeśvara : Well, there are people in the refrigerator now. There are people who have voluntarily put themselves in a big block of ice. They were told before they went inside that they would be defrosted in about fifty years.",Prabhupāda, Then what he will do? (laughing)
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : They should take a few out now and see if it worked.,Prabhupāda," No, that can be done. The yogic process. It is called kumbhaka . Samādhi . You stop your breathing, and you can keep yourself for thousands of years. That is the kumbhaka . But this art is known by the frogs also."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : By the frogs?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Automatically... There was news that in the coal mine all of a sudden a frog came out and it was estimated that... Because the coal is formed by the ruins. So when there was ruins, at least ten thousand years ago, during the ruins, the frog was encaged. And it formed coal. Still he was living. That means he lived at least for ten thousand years. So Brahmā lives for ten millions of years. So what is the... They are also condemned. Ā- brahma -bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartinaḥ [Bg. 8.16 ] . Kṛṣṇa says, ""What is the use of going to Brahma - loka . Even if you live for millions of years, you will have to die."" Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama : [Bg. 15.6 ] ""But if you come to Me, you will never have to die."" Our struggle is for that purpose. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa - medhasām [Bg. 7.23 ] . for these things, those who are trying, they are less intelligent."
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : (about passerby) He's got one arm, and he's running to keep healthy.",Prabhupāda," Yes. (laughs) In the morning they begin fishing, this walking, and golfing, no engagement. These poor fellows, they have been not informed that there is better engagement. They do not know. This is their civilization. And here, Kṛṣṇa conscious young men, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa . That is the difference. They appreciate the Kṛṣṇa conscious boys. ""Bright faces,"" they say. The priests and the common gentlemen, they say, and they inquire, ""Are you American?"" They see it. Come and see in our Los Angeles temple, in every temple, how these younger boys and girls are sitting so peacefully, look so nice. Is it not? A year ago, all hellish. Hellish. The same boys, the same girls. That's a fact. Just the counterpart of our society is the hippies-frustrated, all disappointed, mad . They should come forward now to cooperate with this movement. The other day one somebody came to solve the problems of the hippies."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Oh, in Rome ? Desmond O'Grady?",Prabhupāda," Yes. As soon as we suggested chant Hare Kṛṣṇa , he left."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : The social worker.,Prabhupāda," Yes,"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : With the long hair.,Prabhupāda," Ah ha . So, he did not like the idea?"
Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,"Yogeśvara : He didn't think it was very practical.; Guru - gaurāṅga : He thinks it works but not all the time. He thinks it works for some people, but not for all people.",Prabhupāda," And all people... Any good thing, it is meant for some people, not for all people. But if there is an ideal class of men, the others will follow. Jewel. Jewel is always costly. Still everyone aspires, ""If I get a jewel."" That is wanted. Not that everybody can possess jewel, but still, everybody will appreciate jewel."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : There are a lot of people who don't accept it because they think, ""Maybe it is another imitation jewel. Maybe I'll get cheated again.""",Prabhupāda," So why don't you become once more cheated? You have been cheated so many times. Why not try this also? If that is his argument, that means you have been cheated so many times. So why not once more, and see whether it is cheating or reality? That sense will not come. ""Oh, I have been cheated so many times. Therefore I shall not take."" So why not become once more cheated and see the value? The example, as I say, sometimes. (Bengali) ...that he lost his utensils several times. The thief stole it. Therefore he promised, ""Now I shall take my food on the ground. I shall not purchase any more utensils."" What is...? This is bathing place or...?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : This is where they go water skiing.,Prabhupāda, Water skiing?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Yes. They stand on two pieces of wood and they hold on to a rope, and a fast boat pulls them along the water, like that.",Prabhupāda," Oh. Like, what you have? Surfer? Surfer?"
Karandhara,"Surfing. Yeah, similar.",Prabhupāda," Surfing. Surfing or suffering? (laughter) Unnecessarily, whole day and night they are... This is also another example of māyā . He is actually suffering, but he's thinking, enjoying. It always remains calm and quiet? There is no waves?"
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : Sometimes. In the morning it's very calm.,Prabhupāda, But there cannot be any big waves.
Guru-gaurāṅga; Bhagavān,"Guru - gaurāṅga : No. Not like ocean. [break]; Bhagavān : They are importing dogs in India now, I think.",Prabhupāda, Ah.
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : European dogs.,Prabhupāda," (laughing) First of all, they were importing European masters, and now they are importing dogs. Now they will have to import European brāhmaṇas. Yes. Because in India all the brāhmaṇas are now finished. So for their ritualistic ceremony they will have to import from Europe, America. Long ago... Long ago, not long ago, about four, five years ago, I wrote this fact. [break] ...the communists, as they making, that the state is the proprietor of everything, so what is the harm of accepting God as the proprietor of everything? What is the harm? He is giving up his own right. The state is the proprietor. So why not make ""God is the proprietor""? What is the harm? And actually, God is the proprietor. Now, this lake, it is not made by the state. It is made by God. They are claiming this is Swiss lake. What is that?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Geneva lake.,Prabhupāda," Geneva lake. And a few steps forward, a French lake. So either to the French or Geneva, it does not belong. It belongs to God. He's a fool. Why don't you say, ""God's lake""?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : We could propose them that they change the name, but I think they might be afraid it would drive away the tourists.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam ... [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ]. (end)
Karandhara,"No, according to scientists there is no (indistinct) of rainfall on the moon.",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Bhagavān; Yogeśvara,Bhagavān : It's very hot and very cold.; Yogeśvara : Have they made another mistake?,Prabhupāda, And there is no water also.
Karandhara; Bhagavān; Yogeśvara,"No.; Bhagavān : No, water.; Yogeśvara : They say that the moon is covered by a very thick layer of dust.",Prabhupāda," But according to our śāstra , moon is one of the heavenly planets. [break] ...is moon in any way? Because there is no water?"
Karandhara,"They say that if they want to set up some houses there, they have to, everything has to be brought there. There's nothing there to use.",Prabhupāda, How the house will be brought there?
Karandhara,"Well, they plan on in the future building stations and...",Prabhupāda, The water has to be taken from the station?
Karandhara,"Yes. Air, water, everything has to be taken.",Prabhupāda," Oh. And still they must go there. And we are proposing another planet, Vaikuṇṭha planet. They are not willing to go there."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : They have found one use for all this space travel. They've decided to... They've experimented grounding lenses, grinding lenses in outer space since there's less dust. They can grind lenses that are more perfect.",Prabhupāda, Hm. Spectacle glass. Good advantage.
Bhagavān; Guru-gaurāṅga,"Bhagavān : There's another purpose. Instead of testing bombs on the earth, they are trying to test bombs on the moon.; Guru - gaurāṅga : There's a park over there. It's very nice to go to.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Guru-gaurāṅga; Bhagavān; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Guru - gaurāṅga : The entrance is a little further down the road.; Bhagavān : Over here Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Look up in the sky here and you can see all the different planets and stars. Can you also look up into the sky, the brahmajyoti, and see all the different Vaikuṇṭha planets?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. The space is three-fourths there. Here the space is one fourth. In one-fourth space there are unlimited number of universes, ananta - koṭi . This material world is situated in a one-fourth space, and three-fourths space, in the spiritual world. Just imagine how big it is. There the Vaikuṇṭha planets, each planet is as big as the universe, so big. There are aeroplanes also. It is described in the Second Canto of Bhāgavatam ."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : When one looks up towards Goloka Vṛndāvana . Just as the... There's a description in Brahma - saṁhitā of Goloka Vṛndāvana with the lotus petals, corolla of lotus petals.",Prabhupāda," No. Lotus... These Vaikuṇṭhas are like lotus petals, and the Kṛṣṇaloka is the middle portion, whorl of the lotus. This way? (some talking in background, French) [break]"
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : The Bhagavad- gītā says that the world is made up of eight energies: earth, air, water, fire, ether...",Prabhupāda," No, no. That Bhagavad- gītā says. I am talking you, you are scientist. Wherefrom the watermelon water comes, and they are grown in the desert?"
Karandhara,"Well, they say the watermelon has an extensive root system which extracts the water from the...",Prabhupāda, So that means there is water.
Karandhara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So how you can say there is no water in the moon planet?
Karandhara,"Well, they can take samples in the desert and find out if there is certain degree of moisture in the soil. They have taken the same samples on the moon and say that there is no moisture.",Prabhupāda," So why the moon planet is bereft of? Material, anything material, it is combination of earth, water, fire, air, ether. Anything material. It is a combination."
Karandhara; Yogeśvara,"Well, there are probably very minute quantities of moisture on the moon. But they say nothing significant, nothing suitable for agriculture.; Yogeśvara : There are no plants growing on the moon. In the desert we find some plants, but they have not found any vegetation on the moon.",Prabhupāda, That means they have not gone thoroughly. One portion of it.
Karandhara,"Well, they have scanners on these satellites which pick up vegetation or life. From hundreds miles away, it will show up on a screen. And they sent it all around the moon, and it hasn't shown any indication of any organic matter or life. They can send this satellite up around the earth planet and they can locate fields of corn, fields of wheat, from hundreds of miles away, just by the way it shows up on these different electronic devices. [break]",Prabhupāda, Take one of these... [break]
Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : The vegetables, made of different elements. [break] ...and they say they found indications of elements that were existing at the time of creation that went into the making of the living entities... (end); I'm still working because I have to entertain with money. In our world you cannot do anything without money. But what may interest you is that we have several manpower who are looking for truth, for the really truth, and trying to attain it and to follow it. And for this reason, it is said to go only according the scientific organization officials, so on, we went in quite revolutionary ways. For instance, we took all biology coming from the energetic point of view which is quite different. Not with the microscope, not with chemical analysis, but with the thinking that everything is only immaterial reaction (?). And with this we achieved extraordinary result. So we have looked at the official world as completely fool.; Yogeśvara : Are you able to understand when he speaks? I can repeat if you like.",Prabhupāda," Yes, you come here."
Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara,"I believe on this point of view. (speaks in French with Yogeśvara ); Yogeśvara : He explains that the group that he is heading up is a little bit revolutionary in the biological field. Instead of taking biology from the point of chemical, microscopic analysis, they take biology from the point of view of energetic, that is to say, everything being energy, stemming from some source, that everything is energy.",Prabhupāda," This is nice. Actually, it is so."
Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz,"And our last official result is, of course, a scandal for the orthodox world. We did transmute matter from one to another. We achieved transmutation like alchemists in the Middle Age, you see. And a single element which is called iron, we make from it chrome which is another single element. And it is so revolutionary that we had the experimentation made completely not from our side but from official organization in France. (French); Yogeśvara : What he says is that the final conclusion of their research work has been...; One of them.; Yogeśvara : One of their conclusions has been to be able to make one element to change into another element. They were able to take iron and transform it into chrome by chemical process, almost like alchemy, he says. And this was very startling for the scientific world.; Result. Result, only with physical heat, eight hundred, and pressure, only this. No laser, no atomic energy, nothing at all. Simply by natural measures.",Prabhupāda," We can give you one information, that metals like bell metal. Bell metal is combination of...? What is called? Tin? Tin? What is another name of tin?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Copper.,Prabhupāda," Anyway, tin and copper and mercury; if you can mix, it will become gold."
Dr. Sallaz,"I'm sure it is possible, from what we have seen and made. But it is not of great interest to make gold.",Prabhupāda," No, we are interested. (laughter) We want gold for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Nobody is paying us. We are simply selling our books. That's all. Nobody paying us, no government, no..., that ""You take so many million dollars for spreading Kṛṣṇa ..."" Nobody. Therefore we require some gold. So biology, what is the basic principle of biology?"
Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz,"Yogeśvara : Do you understand his question?; Yes. Le principe, c'est la vie, life. And what is life? It is energy, speaking in European language.",Prabhupāda," Life, what is his life?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says it is energy, life is energy.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Whose energy? Whose energy? Wherefrom the energy comes?
Dr. Sallaz,"From very, very high up.",Prabhupāda," Hm. Yes. It is... This matter is also energy, and life is also energy. So according to Bhagavad- gītā , this life, or the living being, is superior energy, and the matter is inferior energy. So this living being is combination of the superior and inferior energy. But the superior energy is not matter. It is spirit."
Dr. Sallaz,Exactly.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And it is the... Both the energy are coming from God.
Dr. Sallaz,Exactly.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is our study. So the living energy, the spirit soul, it has got a formation, formation, form. That is also stated in the śāstra , that 1/10,000th part of the top of the hair. Hair, the point, hair. ( Yogeśvara translates in French) 1/10,000 part of the... The exact version is keśāgra. Keśa means hair, and agra means the top. Keśāgra- śata - bhāgasya [Cc. Madhya 19.140 ] . So that point, you divide into hundred, and take again one part of it, and again divide into hundred. That means you divide the top of the hair into ten thousand parts and then that one part is the magnitude of the soul, spiritual energy. That spiritual energy is within you, within me, within the ant, or within the elephant. So we are living entities. And the body is inferior energy, at the present moment. In the material world the body is covering. Just like you are covered by the coat."
Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara,"No, you see, we have tried with some of our members, some of whom are very high in spiritual position, outside of this world. We have tried to look, to reach for the old truth in the very old knowledges of humanity. We have tried this with Indian knowledges. We have tried this with Chinese knowledges. We have tried this with Mexican knowledges. We have tried it everywhere. And we have found that everywhere there is, when you go deep enough, the same truth.; Yogeśvara : He says among their members, many of them are spiritually inclined So they have investigated the ancient scriptures from China and Mexico, all over the world, and they found that if you go down far enough in the philosophy, it is the same truth.",Prabhupāda," Yes, truth is for everyone—if it is truth. Truth cannot be different. Chinese truth is different from Indian truth. That cannot be. Truth is the truth, provided it is truth. You take something myth as truth—that is different thing. So the truth is that this body is formed on the basis of that spiritual spark. That is the truth."
Dr. Sallaz,"For our opinion, scientific knowledges, they speak about the genetic code, and for us, the genetic code is very simple, and we have prepared a revolution, for instance, in the genetic questions in replacing the thousand of books of explanation, scientific, with a single truth, and this truth explains all the genetic code, very simple. [break]",Prabhupāda, Wherefrom the energy comes?
Dr. Sallaz,"From where it comes, our poor human knowledge cannot gain something precise about it. We must believe it—it comes from very high—but to explain it scientifically is completely foolish. That is our opinion. And further, as I said to you when looked at everywhere, if I take India, explain it coming here, that... I received it about ten or twelve years ago. That is what the Christians would speak about, a mystery, something extraordinary. I received from a holy man in India, with which I was corresponding from time to time. Without asking, I received a big book in Sanskrit. I could not understand a word about it. Well, I put it aside preciously...",Prabhupāda, What is that book?
Dr. Sallaz,"It was the Āyurvedic collection. The old Āyurvedic medicine. This was this book. And I learned about it only one year ago because a professor of Sanskrit from India had it come from India to Europe and he's... Paris, I believe. He was a professor of Sanskrit. And showed this book. And he said, ""It is marvelous. You cannot find it anymore. It is the old Āyurvedic medicine."" And this I had for ten years without knowing what.",Prabhupāda," So we are very pleased that you are accepting that the life comes... Life is energy. Now, which is..."
Dr. Sallaz,"We give it a name, energy. It is much higher.",Prabhupāda," No, it is energy, exactly the name. Because we say prakṛti . Prakṛti means energy, nature, nature. Just like it is said in the Bhagavad- gītā , apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām . You find out this verse. ( Yogeśvara translates.)"
Dr. Sallaz,"Our aim. We are looking about. The state of the world is going down since thirty years, I said. With pollution, with strengths, with power, with everything, the world is going down, going to the catastrophe. And there is only one possibility to save it. It is a question of spiritual revolution. Without a spiritual revolution, between twenty, twenty-five years, the world is finished, all the world of which people are so proud.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Dr. Sallaz,"And this we are doing everything in our power to prepare and to do what we can to prepare this spiritual revolution. It is the thing we have to do today to save the world. Without spiritual revolution, there is no possibility to save the world. It is going down definitely. For this earth, yes.",Prabhupāda," So we have started this movement, spiritual revolution, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So why don't you cooperate with us?"
Dr. Sallaz,"Oh, you see we are doing in our field everything we can and we are preparing to bring this special revolution. We have to bring to light all the old knowledges, the real spiritual knowledge. And this is what we are preparing. And it will take one or two years more until everything is prepared, can be shown.",Prabhupāda, You have studied Bhagavad- gītā ?
Dr. Sallaz,Some. Some of the members know it perfectly. I do not.,Prabhupāda," So you read that. Energy, two energies, how they are explained. Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ ."
Dr. Sallaz; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"You see some of members are... (French); Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : This is in the Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad- gītā , text numbers four and five.",Prabhupāda," This is material energy. Bhūmir āpo 'nalaḥ, explain that."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : That the material energies—earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—these energies, they come from Kṛṣṇa . In other words, we are speaking of energy. There is an origin to the energy. We always have an experience. Just like there is sunshine here, but the sun, origin, is millions of miles away. So in the same way these energies also have origin. It's not that they are just existing without some source. And Kṛṣṇa is describing here in the Seventh Chapter—this is called Knowledge of the Absolute—how these energies are related to Him. Now, in the material world it's described that there are two energies. This is called bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā , inferior energy. This will be described in the next verse. Apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām [Bg. 7.5 ] . Now, this is describing the superior energy or the parām , the parāṁ prakṛti . And this is described, ""Besides this inferior nature,"" which is this earth, air, water, fire, ether, ""O Mighty-armed Arjuna , there is a superior energy of Mine which are all the living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe."" So this earth, air, water, fire and ether... Just like your body, it is being sustained by the soul. And as soon as the soul leaves the body, then, of course, the earth, air, water, fire and ether, it is no longer sustained in this fashion. It merges into the various elements or energies. And in this way, we can understand that the material world is made up of two energies, as my spiritual master said: the inferior energy, or this aparā - prakṛti , earth, air, water, fire, ether, etc., and the superior energy, or the living force. So the point is that the life force does not come from a combination of earth, air, water, fire, ether. It is separate. That is a superior energy. And on this point we agree. Now, we have to find out what is the source of both the superior and inferior material energies, or what is God.",Prabhupāda," And that is spiritual energy. That is spiritual energy. When we find out the source of these two energies, that the beginning of spiritual life, or spiritual understanding."
Dr. Sallaz,"And, Your Holiness, you know, some of our members know this perfectly, Bhagavad- gītā and all the holy scriptures, ancient holy scriptures, and all the others too, and have studied them for years, trying to look for truth. I am not in this stage and I'm...",Prabhupāda," But truth is there, explained. Truth is there, Kṛṣṇa . From Him, the energies are coming. He is the Absolute Truth. Paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi . Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, satyam . Then Bhāgavata explains, paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi . Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya . So the Supreme Truth is there within our understanding. But people do not know it. Therefore spiritual revolution means the people should understand what is the Supreme Truth, and then mold their character and activities according to that relationship. Then that is success of human life."
Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Dr. Sallaz; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Dr. Sallaz; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Dr. Sallaz; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Dr. Sallaz,"And I can say to you, we are making a very..., preparing, some of our members, a very important work, which is explanation from the medical point of view of all the genetic code which is in science something absolutely terrific, plenty, thousands of books and so on.; Yogeśvara : What is your explanation of the genetic code?; (French); Yogeśvara : He says... Very interesting. He says one of the conclusions that they have arrived at is that despite all of your research work, despite all of your scientific studies, if you don't have a simple spirit of inquiry, you won't be able to understand the codes of life. He says the genetic codes, actually, it is a great secret, a mystery, which they are trying to prepare for general understanding, and that secret is that you must be of a simple, humble spirit in order to understand the mysteries of life.; You must try to look for truth, and when you look for truth, you see very extraordinary and simple solution explaining everything for the scientific men. But the time is not right to give it to them. A little later, yes.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : You spoke of a destruction. You said that without a spiritual revolution, there would be some type of destruction. What exactly do you think of as destruction?; Oh, the world will be dead.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : No. In the Bhagavad- gītā we have information that the living force, or the soul, is neither born and neither it dies.; Ah, yes. I meant this world. Matter is the earth. Be careful. I don't mean life in general...; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Now, this is the point that my spiritual master is bringing out, that the material energy is inferior, and in order to have a spiritual revolution you have to understand the superior energy which is eternal, without birth and without death. So, of course, there is no question of destruction for the soul.; Destruction in our occidental language and practically, which is not yours.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Destruction in simple terms, just as we know something has a beginning and something has an end. That is destruction. So in Vedic terms that which has a beginning and has an end is called material, and that which has no beginning and no end, but is existing nonetheless, that is called spiritual or superior energy.; Of course. This cannot be destroyed.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That cannot be destroyed.
Dr. Sallaz,"That cannot be destroyed. It can disappear from the living people, Christian or other of this world, but not at all.",Prabhupāda, Then what do you mean by spiritual revolution?
Dr. Sallaz,"It is to see, to look, for the real truth, the simple truth. The very simple truth. And to abandon our way of life aiming only for money, power and material things, to go back to simple living and especially to living with up.",Prabhupāda, Living with?
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Living with higher thoughts.,Prabhupāda, Then higher thoughts... Is there any definition of the higher thoughts? (French)
Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz,"Yogeśvara : He says humanly it is impossible to understand it.; We can feel it. We can believe it, but we cannot explain it.",Prabhupāda," No, if there is explanation by a person who is not a human being, say, God."
Dr. Sallaz,"Yes, we say God.",Prabhupāda, Then why should you not take it? (French)
Dr. Sallaz; Yogeśvara,We'll accept. (French); Yogeśvara : He said if it were presented he would accept it and try to promote it.,Prabhupāda," Just find out this verse, Eighth Chapter, paras tasmāt tu bhāvaḥ anyaḥ avyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20 ]. Find out the index."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Dr. Sallaz,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ : ""Yet there is another nature which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.""; I am quite agree. And we do all in our center agree with it.",Prabhupāda," So then, first of all, we have to understand what is our constitutional position. We are superior-we, living entities—we are superior energy, eternal. And after annihilation of this body, I, the spirit soul, superior energy, am not annihilated. I accept another body, material body. And there are varieties of body, 8,400,000. ( Yogeśvara translates)"
Dr. Sallaz,"And on this point of view, when some people are going very badly, wrong with us, of course, for us it is like air, but we say, ""Poor people, what about their karma ?"" That is how we look it, ""What about their karma ?"" It is a pity for them that they do so wrong, because they will have to pay for it. That is all.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That ""pay for it"" means, he has got this chance of human body. Now he will have to accept lower grade animal body. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that at least on these points we are in agreement.,Prabhupāda," Therefore the real inconvenience is that I am eternal. I am now put into such condition that I have to change my body, and there is risk of getting degraded body. Therefore my problem is that—I am put into this condition, repetition of change of body—to get out of it—that is spiritual life—and transfer myself there. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyaḥ [Bg. 8.20 ]. Just like we are in this material nature. If we transfer to that spiritual nature, then there is no more this problem, getting this body, again annihilate, again get another body, again annihilate. This problem is solved. And that is spiritual life. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : So he says they completely accept that there is a superior energy which can be attained.,Prabhupāda," So therefore human activities should be dovetailed for going back to home, back to Godhead. That is spiritual movement. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : This is also their idea. This is their point.,Prabhupāda, We are giving this idea in practical form. Why not cooperate with us? (French)
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says first of all, so far as cooperation is concerned, he is just one man. He is the president, although he is the president, still, he is only one man, and he can only speak in terms of cooperating with the spiritual movement among the more enlightened members of his group.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is required, because if the enlightened men of the society does something, others will follow. It is not that the general mass of people has to be educated. They will be automatically educated. They will follow. If the enlightened man is living in such a way that he is going to be transferred to the spiritual world, then others will follow. That is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā , yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ [ Bg . 3.21 ] . At least, there must be a class of men, ideal men, that they are preparing themselves for transferring to the spiritual world. Then people will see that ""Here is the ideal man,"" and they will try to follow. (French) But if people see that ""He is also like us. He is also drinking, he is also eating meat, and he is also having illicit sex,"" then where is the ideal man? Everyone is implicated with these things, sinful life. (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He knows about Guru Maharaji. He says he has so many people following him. The only conclusion that we can have is that there are many, many people who are looking for spiritual life.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Sallaz,And they took everything they can find.,Prabhupāda," That is a fact. People, especially in the western world, they are actually looking after some spiritual emancipation, but they think that from India... Actually, that is a fact. Therefore, any rascal comes, they go around him. But why the western people, those who are on the top of educational and social position, they try to understand what is spirit life and follow them, and place an ideal life so that others may follow. (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Some of his members, some friends, were even visitors at the temples at Benares.",Prabhupāda," That is as a tourist, but that is not understanding of spiritual life."
Dr. Sallaz,"I don't speak of tourist. I speak of a holy man. Be careful. Not a tourist. As a man having attained very high in truth, and for this reason, and not as a tourist. He was at the time crowded like you.",Prabhupāda, Holy man means...
Dr. Sallaz,(French),Prabhupāda, The real purpose of going to holy places is to find out there the holy man and take knowledge from him. That is real going to the holy places of pilgrimage. (French)
Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz,"Yogeśvara : He says that his members, who have gone to India, they themselves are considered to be holy men.; And he went not there as tourist or to inquire. He went to speak, to try to speak about the truth, not about..., for questions.",Prabhupāda, So some of you have gone. So what truth you have seen? That is... What is the truth? What you have learned about the truth? (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : That we must continue to look for it.,Prabhupāda, But that is... They have not looked. Or they have not found out.
Dr. Sallaz,To try to reach it.,Prabhupāda," They are trying. They are trying, but they have not reached. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says he doesn't pretend to have found it.,Prabhupāda," That's it. But then the next step is just to now find it. Here is the truth, Bhagavad- gītā , Kṛṣṇa . So why don't you accept this truth? If you are actually trying to find out the truth, here is the truth. It is accepted by all learned scholars and ācāryas of India: the Supreme Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa , so why don't you study Kṛṣṇa ? (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that's the kind of question you would have to ask his members.,Prabhupāda," I can ask the members. I can talk with the members. If they are actually trying to find out the truth, then I can present them the truth. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that perhaps his members won't think that they need this kind of truth.,Prabhupāda, Then what is the searching after truth? It is hypocrisy. (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Maybe they already know the truth.,Prabhupāda, Then what is that truth? Let us know.
Dr. Sallaz,I am sure that some of them knows perfectly well all the Bhagavad- gītā . (French),Prabhupāda, What is that?
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that you don't really need proof to convince anyone. Why should he have to show proof that you know...,Prabhupāda," No, if you are searching after truth... Suppose if you are searching after gold. And if I give you gold, why don't you accept it? (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Apparently his position is that by their research, they have discovered the truth.",Prabhupāda, What is that truth? (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says it's the same truth that we are following.,Prabhupāda," Well, same truth, this is vague. But what is the tangible presentation of the truth. (French)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says he can't explain it.,Prabhupāda, We can explain it. Why does he not take from us? We can explain it. (French)
Dr. Sallaz,"I do not. Be careful. I am trying to understand. I do not. I don't say to you I know the truth, not at all. I hope to know...",Prabhupāda, Then why don't you take truth from us? (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says because he already has a guru and he already has everything he needs.,Prabhupāda, But your guru has not given you the truth. You do not know. (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that the guru doesn't give the truth just like that. He says it's something that you have to work for little by little.,Prabhupāda," Then he does not know what is truth. We can give truth. Just like I give you some money, ""Here, take this hundred dollars,"" we can give the truth in that way. (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Why he should take it just like that when he can go on as he is going, preparing himself little bit by little bit.",Prabhupāda," Why little bit? If he gets the, I mean to say, thing immediately, why should you go little by little? (French) Suppose you are... (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says because he finds it more pleasing. His spiritual master has given him a name Ratnānanda, and he says that that name means one who prepares himself little by little for the truth.",Prabhupāda," But is that very good intelligence? Suppose you are searching after one million dollars. You are working little by little, little, and if somebody says, ""Here is one million dollar. You take it,"" Why don't you take it? (French)"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says it's a moral question. He already has his guru , and his guru has died. He's gone over to the other side, and he can't change gurus.",Prabhupāda," But there is no question of changing guru . If he is actually searching after the truth, then why he is denying the truth when it is delivered? (French)"
Yogeśvara; Dr. Sallaz,"Yogeśvara : He would have to be sure that it was the actual highest truth.; The real truth, eternal truth. Because you see...",Prabhupāda, That is... That we are... (French)
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : This is what the conclusion we came to yesterday with that other guest, that he says they have also find truths in China, they have also found truths in other scriptures.",Prabhupāda, So what is that truth? (French) [break] ...is that reality?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says he himself, he doesn't have the words to describe it.",Prabhupāda," If you cannot describe the reality, then you have not received the reality. (French) [break] That means, as soon as you say you cannot describe, then you have no idea what is the reality."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He's willing to admit that.,Prabhupāda," So if you are actually searching after reality, why not, if reality is available from other source, why don't you take it? [break]"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Because certainly his members would have some questions they would want to ask you, and perhaps even you might have some questions that you would want to ask his members.",Prabhupāda, Very good. We are prepared. (French)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : I think the thing is to make arrangement for such a meeting. Otherwise...,Prabhupāda, Then make arrangement. But our pro... (end)
Prof. Regamay,"Yes. Yes, I have seen. I have read them, but the Bhagavad- gītā I have not yet received.",Prabhupāda, Not yet seen Bhagavad- gītā ?
Guru-gaurāṅga; Prof. Regamay,"Guru - gaurāṅga : He has seen, but he will get today.; And perhaps, some questions I could put to you?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prof. Regamay,"But first I would like to express my thanks that you gave me this honor to receive me. So I have different questions because I'm in such a difficult situation that I have many Indian doctrines, and there was some difficulty because I know them only through the books, without (indistinct). And, for instance, one of the first questions I want to put: Viṣṇu Purāṇa , it's very similar and very coincidental to the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes, Viṣṇu Purāṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"Is that... Practically, can it be considered that it's the same kind of...",Prabhupāda," Yes, Viṣṇu Purāṇa is Vaiṣṇava literature. There are eighteen Purāṇas. Out of eighteen, six are sāttvika , and six are rājasika, and six are tāmasika. The sāttvika Purāṇas, they are Vaiṣṇava literature. Viṣṇu Purāṇa , Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa , Bhāgavata Purāṇa , Padma Purāṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"The same... Because I understood through... It is that the problem, that Kṛṣṇa is the original person of divine, but in, by Rāmānuja or Viṣṇu Purāṇa it reverse Viṣṇu is the highest.",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu .
Prof. Regamay,And Kṛṣṇa is the avatāra of Viṣṇu .,Prabhupāda, No. Kṛṣṇa is avatārī . You have read Bhagavad- gītā ?
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, of course.",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa says, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ . Find out this verse."
Guru-gaurāṅga; Prof. Regamay,"Guru - gaurāṅga :; Yes, I know what it is in the Bhagavad- gītā but, for instance, in the words of Rāmānuja, it is not Kṛṣṇa , but it is Viṣṇu which is the highest form. So this one question, what I had to put that... And also... May I sit down on...? I would be much more...",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Give him another pad ."
Prof. Regamay,"Among the avatāras which are described in the second and third book of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , there are two questions I have to put. There is Kṛṣṇa Himself, who appears as His own avatāra , and the Kṛṣṇa , the yādava Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa , when He appears within this material world... That is also in the Bhāgavatam , that He appears as Viṣṇu incarnation. But actually, Kṛṣṇa is the... In the Brahma - saṁhitā it is stated, yasyaika- niśvasita - kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma -vilajā jagad- aṇḍa - nāthāḥ , viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā - viśeṣaḥ [Bs. 5.48] . You understand?"
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, I understand.",Prabhupāda," Viṣṇur mahān , Mahā - Viṣṇu , yasya iha kalā -viśeṣo govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi . So the Mahā - Viṣṇu , the origin of the material creation... There is Mahā - Viṣṇu in the Causal Ocean. From Him the Garbhodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu enters into each and every universe. Yasyaika- niśvasita - kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma -vilajā jagad- aṇḍa - nāthāḥ [Bs. 5.48] . So jagad- aṇḍa - nātha is Brahmā . So he is produced on the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu . And this Garbhodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu is expansion of Mahā - Viṣṇu . And Mahā - Viṣṇu is kalā viśeṣaḥ , partial expansion of Kṛṣṇa . Yasya hi , yasya hi . What is that? You have Brahma - saṁhitā ?"
Devotee; Yogeśvara,You have a copy downstairs.; Yogeśvara : Yasya prabhā prabhavataḥ [Bs. 5.40] .,Prabhupāda," No, that is another. Yasya niśvasita - kālam avalambya . Mahā - Viṣṇu is breathing. So taking advantage of that breathing, innumerable universes are generating. And each universe, there is a superintending deity who is called Brahmā . Yasya hi niśvasita - kālam . Kālam atha avalambya jīvanti loma -vilajā jagad- aṇḍa - nāthāḥ . Many hundreds and millions of Brahmās there are. They live, only taking advantage of the breathing period of Mahā - Viṣṇu . [break] Mahā - Viṣṇu is sub-plenary portion. First Kṛṣṇa , then Balarāma , then Saṅkarṣaṇa , Pradyumna , Aniruddha , Vāsudeva . Vāsudeva , Saṅkarṣaṇa . Then, from Saṅkarṣaṇa , Nārāyaṇa . Then, from Nārāyaṇa , again catur - vyūha , second Saṅkarṣaṇa , Vāsudeva , Aniruddha . And from the second Saṅkarṣaṇa is Mahā - Viṣṇu . And from Mahā - Viṣṇu , Kāraṇodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu . And from Kāraṇodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu , Kṣīrodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu . The Kṣīrodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu is in each universe. He is the Supersoul. And when any incarnation comes within this world, He comes through Kṣīrodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu . In that way, Kṛṣṇa comes through Kṣīrodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu . But this Kṣīrodakaśāyī- Viṣṇu is the expansion of the expansion of Kṛṣṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, I see, but...",Prabhupāda, It is like that.
Prof. Regamay,Yādava Kṛṣṇa spoke with Arjuna ...,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Prof. Regamay,"It was the personal God Himself or it was an incarnation, this Kṛṣṇa which is in Bhagavad- gītā ?",Prabhupāda," Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta - rūpam [Bs. 5.33] . Kṛṣṇa is one. Advaitam acyutam . Infallible. Anādi , He has no cause. Ananta - rūpam . Ananta - rūpam . Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta - rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa - puruṣam [Bs. 5.33] . He is the origin. Advaitam - acyutam anādim ananta - rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa - puruṣaṁ nava - yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. 5.33] . Still, He's just a fresh young boy. Govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi . So Govinda is the ādi - puruṣam . Aham ādir hi devānām . Find out this verse, aham ādir hi devānām . Rāmānujācārya has also admitted Kṛṣṇa the Supreme. Śaṅkarācārya has admitted in his notes on Bhagavad- gītā , sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ . What is that?"
Prof. Regamay,"Yes. Thank you. Now, I'm still concerned with two of the incarnation which have... Because for me this is the doctrine of personalism and personal highest form of God. Now, among two of the incarnations, there is Kapila and Buddha . And Kapila is practically, finally, the classical Sāṅkhya -ist atheist. How could it be?",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is imitation Kapila , and there is... Original Kapila is Devahūti , son of Devahūti , Kapila ."
Prof. Regamay,It's what we can't find in Bhagavad- gītā with...,Prabhupāda," Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . So Kapila , this Kapila is atheist Kapila . He's a different Kapila . Original Kapila is the son of Devahūti , son of Kardama Muni and Devahūti . That is described in the Third Canto of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . He is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa , God. Kapila . And actually, he enunciated sāṅkhya philosophy. And this sāṅkhya philosophy which is known in Europe amongst the European scholars, that is the atheist Kapila . It is not the original Kapila ."
Prof. Regamay,So that's not a true Kapila .,Prabhupāda, No.
Prof. Regamay,And Buddha ?,Prabhupāda," Buddha is śaktyāveśa- avatāra . We accept Lord Jesus Christ also, śaktyāveśa- avatāra ; Mohammed, śaktyāveśa- avatāra . Śaktyāveśa- avatāra means a living entity especially empowered and he preaches the philosophy on behalf... That is called śaktyāveśa- avatāra . There are different types of avatāras. Guṇāvatāra, manvantarāvatāra, yugāvatāra, līlāvatāra, śaktyāveśāvatāra, like that. They are described in the Caitanya - caritāmṛta . About avatāras. You find out Teachings of Lord Caitanya , avatāras. Innumerable avatāras. Come here. Find out this chapter. Avatāra saṅkhyeyaḥ. It is compared, just like in the river, the waves are flowing. You cannot count, or in the... What is that? Avatāra . Read, read that chapter."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, I understand.",Prabhupāda," Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya dīpāyate vivṛta - hetuḥ [Bs. 5.46] . They are not derived from any other power. They are all Viṣṇu - tattva . Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya dīpāyate , yas tādṛg eva ca viṣṇu - tayā vibhāti [Bs. 5.46] . This is the expansion of Viṣṇu , Viṣṇu - tayā . Govindam ādi - puruṣam . He is always referring, Govinda , Kṛṣṇa . Govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **."
Prof. Regamay,Yet I still think of this problem why Lord Kṛṣṇa had to have an incarnation like Buddha who was teaching atheist doctrine and no...,Prabhupāda," That is described. I have described in the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . Find out, Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam , First Canto, first part."
Prof. Regamay,"I read it in your commentary to Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam that he was, he didn't need to preach the worship of God because He was Himself God.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prof. Regamay,But He doesn't say it in the text.,Prabhupāda," That is described in the SB.., sammohāya sura - dviṣām [SB 1.3.24 ]. Sammohāya , just to bewilder the atheist class of men. The atheist class of men, we're advocating ""There is no God."" So He appeared before them... And they were killing animals like anything. So Buddhadeva inaugurated the non-violence. So therefore He is God Himself, and He is teaching, ""There is no God."" This is rather cheating."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes. Not teaching, but cheating.",Prabhupāda," Yes. (laughing) So sometimes... Just like a child does not want to go to school. So the teacher says, ""No, no, you don't require to go to... There is no need. But what do you see in your front?"" ""That's a cow."" ""Now, what is this?"" ""A leg."" ""Then what is next?"" ""Second leg."" ""What is this?"" ""Third leg."" So he is teaching mathematics, but practically, he says, ""You don't require go to school. You just count the legs of the cow, that's all."" It is like that."
Prof. Regamay,Now there are some schools of Buddhists who are worshiping Buddha like a God.,Prabhupāda," Yes, He is God. He is God. They don't accept Buddha as incarnation of God. But from Vedas we understand that He is incarnation of God."
Prof. Regamay,"But he brought to the world the ahiṁsā , but I think ahiṁsā appears already in the Bhagavad- gītā . But there was ahiṁsā also by the Jains.",Prabhupāda," Ahiṁsā , because at that time people were killing animals in the name of yajña . Just like in the Christian world the order is not to kill, but still, they are killing. So this misuse of scriptural injunction is always going on. A class of men there are who abuse the scriptural injunctions and go on with their own motive. So there was a period when people, under the protection of Vedas... Because Vedas, animal sacrifice is recommended for certain purpose, to test the proper chanting of Vedic mantras. The animal was not killed. The animal was put into the fire. Then again it would come out with new life. That is the proper chanting of the Vedic mantras. So for that purpose, animal sacrifice... Just like in biological laboratories, they experiment on the body of animals, frogs, guinea pigs. Similarly, a similar experiment was made, how the Vedic mantra is being properly chanted. The test was that animal should be put into the fire, and if the Vedic mantras were properly being chanted, then that animal would come with a new body. So an old cow or bull was put and he would come with fresh body. That was the purpose. Now later on, they began to eat meat by so-called animal sacrifice. In that period Lord Buddha appeared. About him it is, description is there, sadaya - hṛdaya darśita - paśu -ghātam. The Lord became compassionate on the animals, as they were being killed unnecessarily. So Buddha , Lord Buddha , his only mission was to stop the sinful activities of animal... Ahiṁsā paramo dharmaḥ . He was teaching that. But these rascals, they would show the evidence... Just like Christians says that ""Lord Jesus Christ ate fish"" or something like that. Because Lord Jesus Christ ate fish, therefore they should maintain slaughterhouse. This is their reasoning. The other day somebody questioned me that... I said that killing of animals is sinful activity. So somebody questioned that ""Lord Jesus Christ ate fish,"" somewhere. So I said that He is powerful. He can eat the whole world. But you cannot imitate. You have to follow his instructions, what he says. He said, 'Thou shall not kill.' So you should follow his instruction, not the action."" He is powerful. He can act some way or other, according to circumstances. That is his business. Actually, that is the Vedic statement, that just like the sun, the sun can absorb the urine. People pass urine on the street, and the sunshine absorbs the urine, evaporates, but sun is still pure. Rather, the place where the urine was passed, it becomes disinfected. Similarly, those who are powerful, īśvara , godly, you cannot imitate their actions. They are apparently doing something wrong; still, they are pure. The same example. The sun is absorbing or evaporating the urine, but sun is still pure. But if I imitate and lick up the urine, that is not very good business. Similarly, we cannot imitate the powerful, we have to simply follow the instruction of the powerful. That is... But people, on slight imitation... Is that very good reason? Suppose Christ sometimes ate fish, but that is sufficient reason to maintain big, big slaughterhouse? Because Christ said... And he teached in the desert. Suppose there was no food and he had to eat some fish. So that is his business. He could do it. He is powerful. But does it mean on that strength throughout the whole world the Christians will maintain big, big, up-to-date machinery for slaughterhouse? So it is sinful. So Buddha wanted to stop this nonsense, who were eating and killing animals on the strength of Vedas. They did not know what is the meaning, but they would say in the Vedas it is stated, paśavo vadhyaḥ sṛṣṭaḥ : ""The animals are created for being killed."" And what purpose it is killed? They, without knowing... Actually, they wanted to satisfy their tongue by eating the flesh, but they would give Vedic evidences. So to stop this nonsense business Buddha said that ""I don't care for your Vedas."" Nindasi yajña -vidher ahaha śruti - jātam . Śruti- jātam means Vedic injunction."
Prof. Regamay,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So he condemned, ""No, no. I don't care for your Vedas. "" So he defied Vedic injunction. Because otherwise, he could not establish his theory of nonviolence. The violence, in a certain way, is recommended in the Vedas. So if he says, ""No violence,"" then it is against Vedas. Therefore he had to declare, ""No, no, I don't follow the Vedic injunction."" And because he did not, he publicly declared that ""I don't follow Vedic injunction,"" therefore he is taken as atheist. Atheist means who does not take the authority of the Vedas. Nindasi yajña -vidher ahaha śruti - jātam . But he did it. He is all-powerful. He can do it. Why? Sadaya - hṛdaya darśita - paśu -ghātam keśava dhṛta - buddha - śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare . We worship him like that. Keśava dhṛta - buddha - śarīra jaya jagadīśa . From philosophical point of view, he is taken as atheist. But we Vaiṣṇava we know that He is God. He is God, incarnation of God."
Prof. Regamay,"I have been struck in Ceylon on seeing in Buddhist temples, Viṣṇu .",Prabhupāda," Viṣṇu , yes. There are in Penang. Penang also I have seen. They admit that Buddha is the incarnation of Viṣṇu . That is admitted in the śāstra . That means these Ceylonese or Penangese, originally they knew that Buddha is incarnation of Viṣṇu . In Ceylon you have seen?"
Prof. Regamay,I have seen.,Prabhupāda," Similarly, I have seen in Penang also, Viṣṇu , Viṣṇu - mūrti ."
Prof. Regamay,"And but he said also, the doctrine of Buddha , that man has not person, doesn't exist as person. He's only some moving elements, physical and psychical and nothing else.",Prabhupāda, Person. He is person. He is person. Lord Buddha is person.
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, but Brahman is not person. Brahman .",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says that Buddha's philosophy did not admit a spiritual personal identity to the living being, that Buddhist philosophy was that we are simply this combination of chemicals.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is all right.
Prof. Regamay,"Chemical, psychical, but no continuous, no ātman .",Prabhupāda, That is śūnyavādī. We say also.
Prof. Regamay,"So they are... I think it's... I must say that when comparing different religions, I see that for instance, what I find here...",Prabhupāda," There is no different religion. As soon as one tries to understand different religion, it is to be concluded that he does not know what is religion. That religion cannot be different. Religion is one. God is one. And the order given by God, that is religion. But ""different"" means according to time and circumstances... Just like Lord Buddha , he is giving the same religion. He is God, incarnation of God. He is asking, ""Just obey Me."" The same philosophy is being taught by Kṛṣṇa , ""Surrender unto Me."" That is religion. Buddha also says ""Surrender unto Me. Obey Me."" So that is religion. Yes. So the religion is... One who knows God and surrenders to Him, that is religion, and anything, that is all cheating. Anything else, that is all cheating. That is not religion. This is religion. God is one, and surrender to God, that is religion. That's all. You take any religion, it doesn't matter. If one has learned what is God and how to surrender to Him, that is religion."
Prof. Regamay,But I noted that for instance our Christian approach to God...,Prabhupāda, In Christianity they also recommend surrender to God.
Prof. Regamay,"It's nearer to your approach than, for instance, I don't know, as the kevalādvaita I mean, where nirguṇa - brahman is the higher form of, than...",Prabhupāda," Nirguṇa - brahman ... Just like... Here we have got this example. This is, what is called, New Zealand lake, and a few step after...,"
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : Geneva Lake.,Prabhupāda, Geneva Lake. And few step after French lake.
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Because French is a border of Geneva lake also. Therefore sometimes it's considered French.,Prabhupāda," So the sky is one. Sky is one. So in the sky, in the atmosphere, where God is forgotten, that is called material sky. And the sky where God is not forgotten, that is spiritual sky. Just like the sky is one, and the sun is one. But when your eyes are covered by cloud, you say the cloudy sky. The sky is not cloudy. The sky is one, it is always clear. But some portion of the sky there is cloud, and you say, ""This is cloudy."" [break] Similarly, materialism means when you forget Kṛṣṇa , that is material. And when you know Kṛṣṇa and act for Kṛṣṇa , that is spiritual."
Prof. Regamay,"Now, one question still. Why in the Ṛg Veda there is not even the name of Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda," Oh yes, Viṣṇu , there is. Viṣṇu and Kṛṣṇa , I have already. There is no difference."
Prof. Regamay,"Viṣṇu , yes, but not the name of Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," No, in Atharva Veda there is name of Kṛṣṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"Viṣṇu , yes, I know that the...",Prabhupāda," So it doesn't require that in every Veda there should be, because the Upaniṣads, they are impersonal study, negation of the material existence. That is negation. There is no positivity. So when you come to the positivity, then you can understand Kṛṣṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"But I am struck that, for instance, for us in the West the idea of personal God is strongly rooted in our consciousness.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Lord Jesus Christ, he was Vaiṣṇava . He directly gave you the idea of personal God. The personal God is the origin. Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB 1.2.11 ]. The... Just like, the same example: the sun god, the sun planet and sunshine, they are one. They are not different. But still, this is impersonal, that is localized, and within the sun globe, there is the sun god. So sun god is the origin of this light. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa , the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is the origin of everything. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvam [Bg. 10.8 ] . That's the fact. But people with poor fund of knowledge they cannot understand it. Therefore stop... [break] ...light, that's all. So much. Just like Lord Buddha . He did not explain anything about God. He said, ""Just obey me and stop this animal killing."" Therefore this much sufficient for him, that's all. The lower class students, one plus two equal to three, two plus two..., that much mathematics, not higher mathematics. Higher mathematics is not possible to understand."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, of course.",Prabhupāda," That's it. But there is higher mathematics. Not one plus two or two plus three, no. There is still higher mathematics. So that is not meant for them. That will be explained, explained in the Bhagavad..., ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. 4.11 ] . Those who are expert, or sufficient, insufficient knowledge, they cannot understand the Supreme Absolute. That is also confirmed, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate : [Bg. 7.19 ] ""After many, many births, when one is actually in full knowledge, he can understand Kṛṣṇa and surrenders unto Him."" Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. 7.19 ] . So Vedas and scriptures are there, differently, according to different conditions. Now, what Jesus Christ was teaching the people? You can understand. The first injunction is ""Thou shalt not kill."" So what class of men they were, just you can understand. Otherwise, why he is first of all telling ""Thou shalt not kill""? The Mohammed also said, ""From this day, there is no sex with your mother."" So just see what class of men. So according to class of men, there should be teaching. Similarly, Buddha also, Lord Buddha said, ""No, no, there is no God. Just try to understand me. You obey Me."" ""Yes, sir."" It has to be done like that."
Prof. Regamay,"Still, there are two questions I have which remain. One is quite a small question. I have read in your commentary to the chastisement of Droṇa , killing of Droṇa , and where it was that violence for a right cause is better than the so-called nonviolence. Now I wanted to ask, for instance, to find that nonviolence or like Gandhi , it was wrong...",Prabhupāda," Gandhi was not a man of spiritual under... He was a politician, that's all."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, but in his personal...",Prabhupāda," Gandhi , actually he did not know anything."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, he read Bhagavad- gītā in English.",Prabhupāda, That is also nonsense. There was no Kṛṣṇa . There was no Mahābhārata or Kurukṣetra . He has written like that.
Prof. Regamay,"But he was dead with the words Rāma , pronouncing, ""Rāma Rāma .""",Prabhupāda," Well, I... That is the process of India to chant the name of Kṛṣṇa . Every Indian has got initial propensity, but actually Gandhi did not know anything about spiritual science. He was politician, that's all. That one Bengal governor, he was from Australia, Mr. Keziar (?). So he, I remember. ""Gandhi is a politician amongst the saintly person or a saintly person amongst the politicians."" This study was made. His moral principle, character, is very good. That is to be taken by the politicians. But so far his spiritual knowledge is concerned, that is nil."
Prof. Regamay,But nonviolence is not well in every case?,Prabhupāda," No, nonviolence... Actually that is the subject matter of Bhagavad- gītā . What do you mean by nonviolence. Because you are not this body. Suppose if I tear away your coat, does it mean that you are killed? So those who are in the bodily concept of life, ""I am this body,"" for them, this kind of fighting or killing is violence. It is violence. But the thing is, there is sometimes necessity. Just like every state maintains the military force, the police force. What is this? The violence department. Required. That is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā , paritrāṇāya sādhūnām [Bg. 4.8 ] . Suppose you are attacked by some rogue, and if somebody comes and kills him, there is a necessity. It is natural. If you say that time nonviolence, it is foolishness. It is foolishness. Vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām . Those who are rogues and, I mean to say, culprit, criminal, they should be killed. They should be stopped by violence. So violence is required sometimes. Violence is not bad, but it is not to be used ordinarily."
Prof. Regamay,"But this young boy who was asking what to do with the fascists the day before yesterday, he wanted precisely violence to fight against the fascists. You, remember...",Prabhupāda," First of all, the thing is that our principle is vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām . Those who are sinful rogues, to kill them. Now, we have to judge whether the fascist, he is sinful or the person attacking the fascist, he is sinful. If both of them are of the same category, then where to use violence or to use nonviolence? Now... Formerly, there was fight between nation to nation and now, we have seen in Italy—I was in Rome —now they are fighting amongst themselves."
Prof. Regamay,Awfully.,Prabhupāda, Amongst themselves. Now they will fight in the family. So people are becoming so degraded. They require all to be killed.
Prof. Regamay,Yes. (laughter),Prabhupāda," The fascist and the non-fascist and this and everyone... And that is being prepared, the atomic bomb. You see? They will be all killed, nature's way. You see? They have become so sinful. I am speaking this freely because you are a gentleman, but the civilization, modern civilization, everyone is addicted to intoxication, everyone is flesh-eating, everyone is illicit sex, everyone is addicted to gambling. So where is pure person? They require all to be killed, fascist and non-fascist. Because according to Bhagavad..., paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. 4.8 ] . All these people, under different names."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, it's violence for the violence's sake practically.",Prabhupāda," So people are so degraded, and there is no education, and there are so-called leaders. They are themselves degraded, they are themselves blind. So what is the position of the present society? It is very precarious condition. Therefore, at the end of Kali - yuga , people will be more and more, more and more degraded. There will be no more preaching. Kṛṣṇa will come as Kalki avatāra , simply killing, simply killing. That's all, finished."
Prof. Regamay,But they have still four thousand years of Kali - yuga .,Prabhupāda," Not four thousand, 400,000. So here the time is coming. And now the partial killing is going on. You drop this... The atom bomb is ready. You have got, I have got. I drop on you, and you drop on me. Both of us, we finish. This is going to be happening. People are so degraded. So unless one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no possibility of being saved. There is example, that grinding mill... You know, grinding mill?"
Prof. Regamay,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, and the grains are put within it and they are all smashed. But one grain who takes shelter of the center, the pivot, it is not smashed. Similarly the modern civilization is such that everyone will be smashed. And one takes the central point shelter, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he will not be. Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. 9.31 ] . So best thing is to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa and save yourself. Save means... This is saving, if you simply understand Kṛṣṇa . Janma karma ... Kṛṣṇa appears, disappears. Kṛṣṇa works here also, in the battlefield or in other field. Kṛṣṇa has a whole activity. You study Kṛṣṇa Book, beginning from the birth up to the point of His leaving this world. Full of activities. Not that because He is God, He is sitting one place. No. Full of activities in all different spheres of life. Art, philosophy, politics, sociology, military arts—everything complete. That is Kṛṣṇa ."
Prof. Regamay,"Yes, of course.",Prabhupāda," That is Kṛṣṇa . If He would have appeared as Viṣṇu with four-handed, then He had to take only worship. That's all. No other activity. Therefore He appeared with two hands like human being. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. 9.11 ] . So simply if we understand what are the activities of Kṛṣṇa , then we become eligible to go back to home, back to Godhead. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar . We are teaching that thing, ""You try to understand Kṛṣṇa and all problems of life solved. You go back to home, back to Godhead."""
Prof. Regamay,"Everything is done by Kṛṣṇa , and we are only the tools for Him.",Prabhupāda," Everything is done by Kṛṣṇa . That's all right. But ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. 4.11 ] . As you want Kṛṣṇa to do that, He says, ""Only just surrender unto Me."" He wants that. But you want so many things. Therefore He gives facility. ""All right, do it, at your risk."" He doesn't want. He says, ""Give up all this nonsense."" Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam [Bg. 18.66 ] . ""Just surrender unto Me."" That He wants. But because we will not do that, we want to do something else, but I cannot do without His sanction, therefore He sanctions. That means Kṛṣṇa does everything. But I want to do, and simply I want His sanction. Therefore, out of His causeless mercy, He agrees, ""All right do it."" But you have to get the result of it."
Prof. Regamay,I thank you very much.,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa .
Prof. Regamay,It was very extremely useful. Just ends some problems. (end),Prabhupāda," As soon as... Just like dog he does not know that he is controlled by the master, ""Tch tch tch tch,"" chain. He does not know. He is thinking, ""I am now free. Rau! Rau! Rau! Rau! Rau!"" This is the position, no difference between the dog and so-called big, big men. If the dog thinks that he is free and he can jump over anywhere freely, is it possible? No. Fully controlled under the master. He has accepted this control."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Especially in the western countries, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the people do not like to think that they are controlled or that they are...",Prabhupāda," Therefore they are rascals. He is controlled in every step, and he is thinking... Therefore rascals. In spite of this big, big house, nice road and good car, they are rascals. But he thinks falsely. He thinks that he is independent; He will not die. Then why does he think like that, like a foolish man? As soon as māyā kicks on his face, he will die. That's all. Immediately. ""I have got some business, sir."" ""No, no, you must die immediately."" And still, he thinks that he is not controlled. What is this nonsense? We shall go that side? That is knowledge, that ""In spite of my all so-called advancement of civilization, I am controlled."" That is knowledge. That is the beginning of knowledge. Then he should think how to get out of it. That is intelligence. And if, like cats and dogs, he thinks that ""I am not controlled,"" then he is no better than cats and dogs. That is explained in the Bhagavad- gītā . Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. 3.27 ] . By prakṛti , by nature, he is pulled by the ears, ""Come here!"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Come there!"" ""Yes, sir."" And he is thinking, not controlled. As soon as he eats little more than he requires, ""You must starve three days!"" And he is not controlled. Just see. How much foolishness. And they are getting Nobel Prize. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB 7.5.31 ] . Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ [ SB 2.3.19 ] ."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : No one has ever gotten a Nobel Prize for saying, ""Yes, we are all controlled.""",Prabhupāda," Because the man who is awarding him Nobel Prize, he is also a rascal, (laughs) and he is also rascal. The society of rascals, that's all. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, therefore, ""This is a society of cheaters and cheated."" That's all. Somebody is cheater, and somebody is cheated. And they have made a civilization of cheaters and cheated. That's all. They have got good sense. They have... Just try to utilize it. Just like last night that gentleman, ""In my opinion..."" He never thinks that what he is, what is the value of his opinion. But he thinks, ""In my opinion..."" And what is this nonsense? What is your opinion? Then he admits ""No, no, I have no objection."" That is progress, that he admitted his fault. What is the value of your opinion? I said, ""We have no opinion. We take the opinion of Kṛṣṇa , that's all."" We have no opinion."
Guru-gaurāṅga,"Guru - gaurāṅga : You caught him in the end, though, when you said, ""If Kṛṣṇa is man, then this is no value."" And then he said, ""How do you know Kṛṣṇa really spoke this? How do you know this is really Kṛṣṇa ?"" So actually, he just did not accept Kṛṣṇa from the beginning.",Prabhupāda," No. He thinks that ""Kṛṣṇa is a bigger philosopher, that's all. And I am also philosopher. So He has got His opinion, I have got my opinion. That's all."" They think that. That is described, avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ : [Bg. 9.11 ] ""These rascals thinks Me as one of him, one like him."" Mūḍha . Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ . Therefore Dr. Radhakrishnan and other rascals like him, they think, ""Why Kṛṣṇa shall say, 'Surrender unto Me?' This is sophistry."" What is the meaning of sophistry?"
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Sophist is half-wise and half-foolish.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He thinks that ""I am as good philosopher as Kṛṣṇa . Why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa ? I have got my own opinion."" He thinks like that. And that rascal is writing commentary on Bhagavad- gītā . And it is selling also. Therefore we presented Bhagavad- gītā As It Is, not a rascal ism."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : People buy his book because he is the former president of India. They think he's authority.,Prabhupāda," That's all. He does not know that he is a fool number one, fully under the con... Now his position. I saw him in Madras."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Paralyzed, paralyzed.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, you cannot recognize. And he gives his opinion. Just see. Nobody thinks that ""If I am not controlled, I do not wish to die, why there is death? I do not wish to become old. Why there is old age?"" A common sense. ""I do not wish to be diseased. Why there is disease? And still, I am thinking that I am not controlled."" That means no brain even, common sense. Piśācī pāile yena mati -cchanna haya . Just like ghostly haunted, madman. He stands on the st..., ""I am the king."" He stands on the street. It is like that. He does not know, ""At any moment I will be knocked by any car and I shall die."" But he thinks like, ""I am the king."" Madman. They are all madmen."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : I remember when I was living downtown eastside New York, there was one drunkard who was standing on the street directing traffic, trying to stop the cars.",Prabhupāda," Yes. They do that. We have seen that. He thinks, ""I am the controller. He must do..."" (laughter)"
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Everyone who has read your Bhagavad- gītā , Śrīla Prabhupāda, after having read so many Bhagavad-gītās, everyone has understood that ""At last Bhagavad- gītā is very clear and simple to me. I have not understood before.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. Because all these so-called Bhagavad- gītā commentaries written by rascals, that's all. They are all rascals. They cannot understand what is Bhagavad- gītā . The MacMillan Company's trade manager has admitted that while others Bhagavad- gītā is selling less, this is increasing. (pause)"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : So I prepared one argument this morning.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : There's a theory of the psychologists that—in some ways it's similar to our idea—that people are conditioned, that according to their environment, according to their upbringing, according to their parentage and so on, they have a kind of way of acting and thinking. So their argument is that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is just another kind of conditioning, that you leave one kind of conditioning, a material conditioning, but then you also enter into another kind of conditioning when you live in the temple.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is conditioning, certainly. The position is that you must be under certain condition. That is your position. So if you become conditioned by God, that is your perfection. And if you become conditioned by māyā , that is your trouble. You must be conditioned. That is your position. You cannot be independent. And therefore, if you become naturally conditioned, then that is your happy life. Just as child, he must be conditioned. But when he is conditioned by his parents, that is his perfection of life. Your position is that you must be conditioned. Why you are thinking to be independent? That is your rascaldom. You should always know that ""I must be conditioned. That is my life."" Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. 9.13 ] . Condition. Still conditioned, but daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ , under the spiritual nature. That is Mahātmā . Mahātmā is not independent. He is also conditioned. So first of all, we must understand that our natural position is to be conditioned. Now, why, where I shall be conditioned? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekam [Bg. 18.66 ] . You condition here. ""You become conditioned by Me. Then you will be happy."" Those who are thinking that ""We shall not be conditioned,"" they are still in māyā . You cannot be without condition."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Their program is that if a child's problems come from the wrong kind of conditioning, then he should be given the opportunity in childhood of a good family, good education, and so on, and that way there won't be bad reaction later on in life.",Prabhupāda," That means he should be given chance for better conditioning. Conditioning must go on. It cannot be said that ""Let the child be given freedom."" No."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Yeah, that's what they say. They say it's freedom when there is a lack of bad conditioning.",Prabhupāda," That is... Bad condition is good conditioning. Where is freedom? From bad conditioning you are suggesting good conditioning. That is not freedom. Just like you are in the prison house, you are badly conditioned, but the so-called freedom—you are still conditioned under the laws of the state. You are not free. But from bad conditioning to good conditioning. And if you obey the state laws, then you are good citizen. But you are conditioned. How you think of freedom? That is your foolishness. Just like a servant. He is in some mercantile firm. He is trying to seek out some government service. But he cannot be free."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : So in other words, they would say your idea is to give them a better conditioning.",Prabhupāda," No, no, no, not better conditioning. You must know what is the best condition and take that condition. The best condition is to be under the control of Kṛṣṇa . That is your best first-class way."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : You said that in the Bhagavad- gītā when it speaks of being desireless, it means that actually one is desiring for Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad- īśa kāmaye : [Cc. Antya 20.29 , Śikṣāṣṭaka 4] ""I don't want this."" ""Don't want, don't want, don't want"" does not mean he becomes negative. ""I want Kṛṣṇa . So many things, 'Don't want,' but actually I want Kṛṣṇa . And that is my life."" And not that ""Don't want, don't want, don't want, then become zero."" Not that."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : No, they also say we know what we want. We want food for everyone, we want...",Prabhupāda," No, no, he does not know. Therefore he is changing from this place to that place. He does not know. If he had known, then he would have surrendered immediately to Kṛṣṇa . That is the defect. He does not know."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : But the idea is ""We can accomplish the same good results even without Kṛṣṇa .""",Prabhupāda," That he does not know. He is a fool. He does not know what is a good result. He will change again. He is a rascal. He is putting himself in this condition; again he'll desire another condition. That is the change of body. That is his wanting. Sometimes he's taking the body of a dog, sometimes he is taking the body of a demigod. Bhramatam upary adhaḥ [1.5.18] . Down, just like, what is that? Merry-go-round."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Ferris wheel, ferris wheel goes up and down.",Prabhupāda," Sometimes ""I am so up,"" and again come down. This is going on. Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān . Therefore, in this way, going round, one who is very, very fortunate, he, guru - kṛṣṇa - prasāde pāya bhakti - latā - bīja [ Cc. Madhya 19.151 ] , he comes to the devotional life by the mercy of guru and Kṛṣṇa . This is the beginning of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. They are under the myth, under the spell of māyā . This is going on."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Well, they say ""You are distributing food, and we are also distributing food. You are opening schools, and we are also opening schools.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. But we are opening school for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore the rascals, they cannot understand what is bhakti and what is karma . Bhakti looks like karma , but it's not karma . It is bhakti . They cannot understand what is bhakti . Bhakti means the same karma , but for Kṛṣṇa's sake. That is bhakti . Just like the same fight, battlefield, but because it was done for Kṛṣṇa , Arjuna is accepted, bhakto 'si priyo 'si me: [Bg. 4.3 ] ""You are My devotee. You are My very dear."" But what did he do? His business was to fight. He fought, that's all. But fought for Kṛṣṇa . That is the secret. He did not change his fighting capacity as a warrior. But he changed his mentality. His mentality was that ""Why shall I kill my kinsmen?"" But Kṛṣṇa wanted, ""Oh, that's all right."" So therefore service is for Kṛṣṇa . That's all. Not for his sense gratification. Karmī means sense gratification, and bhakta means Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification. That is the difference. Sense gratification is there. When you do it for your personal sense grati..., it is karma . And you do it for Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification, it is bhakti . So therefore they look similar, but the quality is different. Harer nāma [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] . Dhare prema nāma . The gopīs, they acted like prostitutes, but the center was Kṛṣṇa . Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, ramyā kacid upāsanā vrajavadhu- vargena ya kalpita (?): ""Oh there is no more better mode of worship than it was conceived by the gopīs. "" What is their conception? Prostitution, that's all. Simple prostitute. Kṛṣṇa was a beautiful boy and they were attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa . They wanted Him as their husband, lover, to dance with them. That is the gopīs. And these rascals are taking that ""This is very good. Kṛṣṇa also did like this. So let us do; gather some girls and dance, and we become Kṛṣṇa ."" This is Māyāvāda , Therefore Vyāsadeva has devoted nine cantos just to understand Kṛṣṇa . Then try to understand what is the gopīs' behavior with Kṛṣṇa . But these rascals jump over it. Sahajiyās. Jump over Kṛṣṇa's dealing with the gopīs. And that is Bhāgavata . Because rascals, they shall remain rascal."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : If the Māyāvādī accepts the principle that bhakti is good, but at the end he throws it away, will he have a change of heart?",Prabhupāda, That is Māyāvāda . That is Māyāvāda . They have no conception of the eternity of bhakti . That is Māyāvāda .
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Will the change in heart come about for such persons because they're somehow associated with Kṛṣṇa ?,Prabhupāda," Just like Kaṁsa associated with Kṛṣṇa always, their position is like that. That is not bhakti . Bhakti is ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] , favorable, not to reject Kṛṣṇa or kill Kṛṣṇa , and think of Kṛṣṇa , ""How to kill Him? How to kill Him? How to kill Him?"" That is also Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but that is not favorable. Therefore it is not bhakti . But they get the salvation because they have some way or other thought of Kṛṣṇa . Impersonal salvation. They are not allowed to enter into the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa ."
Satsvarūpa,"In the beginning of devotional service, the concentration is on the service more than on Kṛṣṇa the person.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Satsvarūpa,"But then gradually, as we serve and serve and concentrate on the service, then there's realization.",Prabhupāda," Yes, realization comes."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Of who we're serving.,Prabhupāda," The disciple serves Kṛṣṇa under the direction of spiritual master. Vidhi - mārga , regulative principles. Vidhi - mārga , rāga - mārga . [break] ...gunarna jata nat krta mukha santi (?). So, I think it is mud."
Satsvarūpa,"Here it's getting more and more moist, dew. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...friend, but what is my business? My business is to serve the senses, that's all. Kāmādīnām, kāma , krodha , lobha , moha , mātsarya , mada , the six kinds of sense gratification I am doing. This is actual... Just like this man, he is thinking he is very big man, but he's servant of his dog. Is it not? But he is thinking that he is very big man. He does not think that ""What is my business? To serve this dog in the morning."" He has no sense. Because he has no prescribed duty to serve Kṛṣṇa ... He must serve, and therefore he must serve dog. That is his position. But still, he's thinking, ""Why these foolish people are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa ? I am serving the dog. I am very big man."" He has become very big man by serving the dog, and we are trying to serve Kṛṣṇa . We..."

Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Is not Professor Dimmock from Chicago?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yogeśvara; Satsvarūpa; Yogeśvara; M. Roche-dieu; Swiss Man (1); Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Professor Dimmock, perhaps you are familiar with Professor Dimmock. He's head of which department?; East Asian.; Yogeśvara : The East Asian Studies Department of Chicago University has written the preface to this Bhagavad- gītā .; I have seen it, yes. Chicago University Department; (French); (French); Yogeśvara : He says he hopes we excuse if he has some basic questions that he wanted to ask. And his first question was regarding tilaka . What is the symbolism, significance?",Prabhupāda," It is just like your cross, amongst Christian. It is temple of Viṣṇu . Not only here, we have got twelve place: here, here, here, here, here. Twelve place. The idea is being protected by Viṣṇu from all sides."
Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : The shaved head, he's asking.",Prabhupāda," This is cleanliness. Instead of keeping unnecessary hair, we keep very clean."
Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : These traditions have existed for a long time, he's asking.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Especially the brāhmaṇas, they keep the shaven head. Brāhmaṇas are the topmost class. What is the symptoms of brāhmaṇa , find out."
Yogeśvara; Nitāi,Yogeśvara : (French); Nitāi :,Prabhupāda," So the Vedic conception is that the human society should be divided into four divisions, namely the brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , vaiśya , and śūdra , natural division. One section of the human society should work as the brain. Another section should work just like the arms, another section, like the belly, another section, like the leg. These four divisions are essential. That is also mentioned, cātur - varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] . Find out this verse."

Nitāi; Yogeśvara; Nitāi; Yogeśvara,Nitāi : 235.; Yogeśvara : You have it?; Nitāi : You want to read it?; Yogeśvara :,Prabhupāda," Just like by nature there are four division in the body—the brain, the arm, the belly, and..., all of them required... You cannot reject any one of them. Then it is not fullness. But the brain should be the, I mean to say, prime director, managing director. So the qualification of brāhmaṇas are stated. Śamo damas titikṣā ? Eh? So at the present moment the society has no brain because there is no person, no person who is qualified like that, samo damas titikṣā ."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," So their qualification, brāhmaṇa qualification, find out. Page?"
Nitāi; Yogeśvara,Nitāi : It's eight twelve.; Yogeśvara : Eight twelve?,Prabhupāda, 812.
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (reads verse 18.42 in French); (French); Yogeśvara : He says, ""Does this Kṛṣṇa consciousness message apply as well to the outcastes?""",Prabhupāda, Outcaste? There are four castes only.
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,But there are the outcastes...; Yogeśvara : Do you mean the untouchables?,Prabhupāda," Outcaste means those who are less than the śūdras. They are called pañcamas. These are four divisions: brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , vaiśya , śūdra . Śūdra means laborer class but they are also obedient to the other three classes. And less than that, they have been described as caṇḍālas, pañcamas, or untouchable as you say. But for us, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, there is no such distinction. Anyone can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The pañcamas, the fifth class men are called caṇḍālas. Caṇḍāla means untouchable. So they are also many: kirāta -hūṇāndhra- pulinda -pulkaśā ābhīra -śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ [ SB 2.4.18 ] . So Kṛṣṇa says, māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa - yonayaḥ [Bg. 9.32 ] . There is... Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda, Read it.
Nitāi,Nitāi :,Prabhupāda," So in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there is no such distinction because we are interested with the soul. The soul is the same everywhere and these designations are different. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is above designation. Sarvopādhi- vinirmuktam [Cc. Madhya 19.170 ] . One is freed from all designation. Actually, on the spiritual level, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, anyone who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is above all these divisions. Sa guṇān samatītya . Find out. Māṁ ca avyabhicāreṇa bhakti - yogena yaḥ sevate , sa guṇān ..."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda, The designations are on the material platform according to the quality. But in the spiritual platform it is transcendental to material qualities. So when one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious there is no more distinction.
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says this seems to be somewhat different from the traditional Hindu practice, since in the Manu - saṁhitā , for example, śūdras are not to be instructed.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but we do not keep him śūdra . A devotee is no longer śūdra . We are creating brāhmaṇas. Just like these Europeans and Americans. They, according to Manu - saṁhitā , they are mlecchas, yavanas. But we are not keeping them mlecchas and yavanas. Just like these European and American boys. They are accepting the Vedic regulatives principles: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. So they are no more śūdras or caṇḍālas. They are brāhmaṇas."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," So it is said, guṇa - karma - vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. 4.13 ] , according to quality and work. When one is educated in the quality of brāhmaṇa , Vaiṣṇava , and he works like a brāhmaṇa , he is no longer śūdra or caṇḍāla or yavana . He is brāhmaṇa or Vaiṣṇava ."
Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : He says, in a sense we're something like the Buddhists because the Buddhists also don't take account of this, of the caste system.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Buddhist or anyone. Just like a person, when he is not educated in medical science he is not a medical man, but when he is properly educated in the medical science and he practices as a medical man, then he is a medical man. So you take it from Buddhism, or Hinduism; it doesn't matter. The thing is, consideration is, guṇa - karma . One must be qualified and he must work. Then he is elevated."
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : In other words, he's saying, what we're saying is that spiritually, everyone is equal, which is actually the same as the Christian idea.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Spiritually, not materially. Materially there must be distinction. Materially there must be distinction. But spiritually there is no distinction."
Swiss Man (2); Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,(French); Yogeśvara : What was his first point?; Guru - gaurāṅga : The point was that in Christianity everyone can become Christian whereas it seems in this only some can become brāhmaṇa . So he is interested what is the path to becoming brāhmaṇa . How does one become brāhmaṇa ?,Prabhupāda," Brāhmaṇa means purified. Just like in Christianity also there are ten commandments. If you do not obey the ten commandments, how you can become Christian?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (French),Prabhupāda," First of all, the quality. The quality of Christian is that he must obey the ten commandments. If he does not obey, then where is his Christianity? That is stated, guṇa - karma : by quality and work one becomes Christian or Hindu or Muslim. There must be the quality. But when the spirituality develops either from Christianity or Hindu or Muslim—it doesn't matter—then there is. Find out that verse, sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB 1.2.6 ] . Read it. This is the ideal of equality. Find out."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa :,Prabhupāda," So our, this movement is to create lover of God. It does not matter whether he follows Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism or this ism or that ism. One must be lover of God, and that is stated in the Bhāgavata . That is first-class religion which turns the followers to become lover of God, that's all."
M. Roche-dieu,"In Christianity, mystics would emphasize the same thing.",Prabhupāda," That is the essence of religion, to know God and to love Him. That's all."
M. Roche-dieu,Yes. Love God and love the man too.,Prabhupāda," Why man? Simply love God; then you will love everyone. Because God is the center, God is the father of everyone, so if you love the father, automatically you love the sons. It is not required that you simply love this son and not that son. That is not love of Godhead. ""I love human being but I do not love the poor animals. Send them to the slaughterhouse."" This is not love of God. So in the Bhagavad- gītā , you will find, God says,"
M. Roche-dieu,Living being.,Prabhupāda," Living, any living. We are all living beings. We are in different dresses. Just like you are European; you have got a different dress. I am an Indian; I have got a different dress. But dress is not consideration. You are a human being; I am a human being. Similarly, all the living entities, they are dressed in 8,400,000's of dresses. But they are living being. And all the living beings are part and parcel of God."
M. Roche-dieu,"(French) Life is a whole view, and there is no division between animals and man.",Prabhupāda," Spiritually advanced man, God conscious, there is no such distinction that ""Here is an animal; here is a man."" He sees that spirit soul is there in the animal and in the man, in the tree, in the plant, in the aquatics, the same spirit soul. Read that."
Nitāi,Nitāi :,Prabhupāda," Yes. The father is God, and they are all sons. But they have, they have been given different types of dress according to karma . So when actually one loves God, he loves all of them as brothers, not that only human being. That is not love of God. Then he does not know what is God. In the Bhagavad- gītā you'll not find a single sentence where it is recommended that ""Only love the human being."" There is no such thing."
Yogeśvara; Frenchman; Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He's asking, ""Well, that's all right. But this love that we have for God, only man can give it. An animal can't love God. A tree can't love God.""",Prabhupāda," But you can love animal. You are not animal. Animal... Just like we are discussing about theosophy because we are grown up, and the child, he cannot understand. That does not mean we shall be unkind to the children. He may be ignorant, the animal may be ignorant, but I am not ignorant. How can I kill the animal?"
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,"(French); Yogeśvara : He's asking, ""How do we see ourselves and how is it that we intentionally distinguish ourselves by dressing differently, by having a different presentation than the rest of society.""; Guru - gaurāṅga : Given the fact that all others, they are loving God too, the same principle, Christianity...",Prabhupāda," No, symptoms must be there. If you love God, then you should love everything of God. You cannot distinguish that ""These are human beings. They should be given service, and the animals should be sent to the slaughterhouse."" That is not love of God. That means he does not know what is God. He is still unaware of God. Just like father. Father has got ten sons. Out of them, one is very intelligent or two are very intelligent; others are fools. And if the intelligent sons propose to the father, ""Father, these are useless sons. Let me kill,"" will the father agree? So God is father of all living entities. He is providing food for the animal, for the man, because He is father. There is, in the jungle of Africa elephants. They are eating at a time hundred kilos. The father is providing. And the ant, a small ant, is eating one grain of sugar. He is providing. Within the hole of your room there are millions of ants. The father is providing food for them. That is God. Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān . That one is providing all necessities of life to everyone, all living entities. That is God. So if I know God, then I can know also that all of them are sons of God and God is providing all their necessities of life. What right I have got to kill them?"
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : (translates) He says, ""Yes, but we see that among the animals there are certain, many species that do eat meat.""",Prabhupāda, Among the animals. But you are not animal.
M. Roche-dieu,They do not eat anything else.,Prabhupāda," But you are not animal. Animals among... The tiger, he is destined to eat meat. But you are not animal. You are human being. Why should you eat? Why you should imitate an animal? Then why there is religion?"
Frenchman; Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : (translates) There's a story. Someone asked Lord Jesus to describe how we should love all people. Describe... Just like a man who has one hundred sheep and there is one of them who has gone astray, he is lost, so the man leaves aside all of his other hundred sheep to go looking for that one sheep. So in the same way, he says, we must take care of the people who are suffering. The minority, those who are suffering, they must receive food, they must be given help and fed.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. But why you should kill animal?
Young Swiss Man (3),At the beginning of Bhagavad- gītā ...,Prabhupāda," And Christ says, ""Thou shall not kill."" Why you are killing? From the very beginning disobedience. How you can become Christian?"
Young Swiss Man (3),"Isn't it at the beginning Arjuna hesitates to kill his family and doesn't want to go to fight, and what he is taught, through Bhagavad- gītā in some way is that he should not restrain and that...",Prabhupāda, But first of all you take your Bible. You are ordered not to kill. Why you are killing? Then go to Bhagavad- gītā . When there is aggression you have the right to kill but not unnecessarily you can kill. Suppose a tiger attacks you; you can kill. But you cannot go in the forest and kill the tiger. That is sinful.
Young Swiss Man (3); Yogeśvara,Why does the distinction stop with animals and not with plants?; Yogeśvara : Why do we make the distinction between not killing animals and plants? Why do we kill plants?,Prabhupāda," We do not kill plants also. We take... Of course, by nature's way some living entity is the food for another living entity. Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam . That is the nature's way. But if you give that argument, then I can say, ""Why you are killing cows? Why don't you kill your own children?"" If that is the way, that ""Because I have to eat some animal,"" so why go outside? Just inside the family there are so many animals. You can kill them and eat. there must be discretion. Apart from this point of view, we Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we do not kill even a plant because, Kṛṣṇa says-find out this - patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [ Bg. 9.26 ] ."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translating) ...jīvo jīvasya jīvanam (French)...,Prabhupāda," There is no jīvo jīvasya jīvanam . Here Kṛṣṇa says, ""Give Me these things, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam . "" There is no question of jīvasya jīvanam ."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," Just hear. Kṛṣṇa is ordering, ""Give Me this food."""
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates) Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati . (translates),Prabhupāda," So we take Kṛṣṇa prasādam . We don't directly do anything. Kṛṣṇa says, ""Give Me this foodstuff containing of vegetables, fruits, flowers, grains."" So we offer them and then you take. If there is any sinful activity there, it is Kṛṣṇa's, not mine."
Yogeśvara; Frenchman,Yogeśvara : (translates); (French),Prabhupāda, (aside) Why don't you open this?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says, ""That may be so, but in the Bhagavad- gītā Kṛṣṇa orders Arjuna that 'You must kill.' """,Prabhupāda, You must kill always. Where is that...? Where is that quotation?
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (French),Prabhupāda, Are... You know... Where is the quotation in the Bhagavad- gītā ?
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : He says in the beginning of the Gītā , Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to fight.",Prabhupāda," Why? ""Because you are kṣatriya . There is fight, war, you must fight. You are meant for..."" Just like my hands, kṣatriya . If there is attack it is hand's duty to protect me. The hand is being asked to give protection. That is natural. If I go to attack you, immediately you spread your hand. This is the duty of the hand. So when there is attack, the other's party, they have come to fight. You must fight because you are hand."
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says, ""But then Kṛṣṇa says, 'Why are you afraid to fight? After all, the soul is eternal, but the body is only temporary.' So isn't that a justification...""",Prabhupāda," But Kṛṣṇa does not say, ""Therefore you open slaughterhouse and go on killing animals."""
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1),Yogeśvara : (translates); (French),Prabhupāda," Well, if you have killed some man and you go to the court and if you say that ""He is not killed,"" will you be saved?"
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says, ""How is this, that the only thing we've talked about since we've gotten here has been eating of meat? Is that the only...?""",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says, ""How is that that the only thing we've talked about since we came today has been eating meat? Is that the only thing that the Bhagavad- gītā teaches?""",Prabhupāda," Yes, because our proposal is that unless you become... Find out that verse, yeṣām anta - gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya - karmaṇām , te dvandva - moha - nirmuktāḥ . This is the beginning of theism. Theism means you must be free from all sinful activities. That is theism. If you remain sinful you cannot make any progress in theism. That is the point. [break]"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Doesn't that make us rather exclusive, that we have some facility for spending all of our time meditating and purifying our lives? Doesn't that make us a rather exclusive group of people? If only those who are completely pure can engage in service, that means only people like us who have time to sit and meditate...",Prabhupāda," What meditation? The thing is that here it is stated, ""Unless one is free from all sinful activities, he cannot be engaged in My service."" And the pillars, according to Vedic, pillars of sinful activities... Just like four pillars. One is this meat-eating, the other is illicit sex, the other is gambling, and the other is intoxication. So unless we break these four pillars of sinful life there is no meaning of meditation or worshiping God. You cannot ignite fire, at the same time pour water on it. So sinful life means destruction of spiritual life. So once you begin spiritual life, and other way you begin sinful life, then how it will be? It is counteracted. There is no progress."
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says there are other sinful activities as well. For example, egoism and jealously.",Prabhupāda," But first of all begin these primary principles, and then others will be automatically stopped."
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He does not think that they will follow naturally just by stopping these four things.,Prabhupāda," Naturally it follows, but if somebody wants to cheat, that is another thing. Naturally it follows."
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : This gentleman suggests that he prefers someone who may be committing all four of these sinful activities but who helps his fellow man.,Prabhupāda," The fellow man helping, what does he gain?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates) He says, ""Even if someone is committing all kinds of sinful activities...""",Prabhupāda," No, no. What you gain by helping your fellow man? First of all that is the question."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He says, ""The purpose of helping other people is not to gain something for yourself.""",Prabhupāda, But I say that you help your fellow man. So do you know how to help him?
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Certain circumstances.; Yogeśvara : He says, ""In certain circumstances.""",Prabhupāda," In certain circumstances, but if you do not know how to... Suppose a man is diseased and you think... The doctor says that he should not eat anything. But if you think that ""Let me give  some food. The doctor is very cruel. He is not giving food,"" is it, that, helping or fully pushing him towards death? First of all you must know how to help. If I do not know—I help in the opposite way—that is not helping. That is degrading. These are all manufactured things. They are not... Helping means, real helping is, that a man or anyone... Everyone is suffering for want of knowledge. So if you can give knowledge, that is real help."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : The first thing is that this gentleman doesn't agree. He doesn't think that the major problem is ignorance. But this gentleman suggests that there is a danger, there's a danger in what he calls ""spiritual pride,"" ""spiritual egoism,"" that is to say, thinking that we have helped someone and actually...",Prabhupāda," But that pride is there. That gentleman is proud that he's helping someone. That prideness is there. But out of these two kinds of prideness, one prideness which is real, that is welcome. If one is falsely proud, that is useless. But if one is actually proud of doing something, then he... That is good. Just like in the Vedic literature it is recommended that you should feel ahaṁ brahmāsmi: ""I am Brahman ."" This is also ego. This is real ego, that ""I am spirit soul."" This is not bad. But when one thinks, ""I am this body,"" he's a rascal. If one thinks that ""I am servant of God,"" that is real ego. And if one thinks, ""I am servant of Satan,"" that is not very good."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : I think this gentleman still isn't feeling satisfied about his question.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : That how can we say that to give people..., that the only real problem is to give knowledge. There are people who are starving; there are people who are sick; there are people who are in so much distress.",Prabhupāda, But you cannot do. You cannot do. There are so many people starving in the hospital. What can you do?
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says, ""Probably not very much."" He said, ""But maybe we can do something.""",Prabhupāda," Then this is simply a false pride, that ""I can do something."" You cannot do anything. Rather, you can do this service, that ""There is God. You are servant of God. Please become servant of God."" And if you make this program, ""I can give food to so many,"" what you can do? There are millions and millions. People are starving all over the world. What can you do? It is simply false pride. You cannot do anything. Now, just like I have heard that in your country, because they have got excess milk supply there was recommendation to kill twenty thousand cows. Is it a fact?"
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : Yes.,Prabhupāda," So is it very good intelligence? Because there is excess of milk supply, why not supply it to others who are starving for milk?"
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,"(French); Yogeśvara : You want to translate that?; Guru - gaurāṅga : ""But when we go to India, on the other hand, you may see cows dying of hunger, just bare skeletons.""",Prabhupāda," But there are so many human beings also dying out of hunger. Is it to be recommended that they should be killed? There are many human being also; they are also skeletons. They have no sufficient food. So if you think that the cows are skeletons for want of food, you supply them food. Why you are restricting? If... The Americans, they are throwing tons of food in the water. Why they do not send to India for feeding the skeleton cows? What the cows have done? They are also living entity. Why you are thinking of human beings, not of the cows?"
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : He says for Protestants especially, there is a feeling that to think that we can become purified of our sins by following some formulary, that is a kind of false pride, that actually to become free...",Prabhupāda," Then why Christ recommend, ""Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not covet. Thou shall not do this. Thou shall not...""? They are all false thing? Now let us talk of knowledge. We have talked so many outside knowledge. What is the real knowledge? The real knowledge is that everything is the property of God. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. No land belongs either to the Americans or to the Swiss people or to the Indian people or to German people. No. Everything belongs to God. And all living entities are the sons of God. So everything produced out of God's land, either on the land or in the sky or anywhere, it is God's property, and all the sons, they have the right to share. So there is no scarcity in the God's kingdom. Simply due to our mismanagement we have created so much trouble. If we accept God as the center and all living entities sons of God, then we can actually live very peacefully in God consciousness. Therefore this is the recommendation, how we can live very peacefully, all of us, both men and animal and everyone. That is said here. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni . Read it."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (reads purport in French),Prabhupāda," So far I have studied... I am traveling all over the world. It is my calculation that we can produce food to give food ten times of the population if we properly utilize the whole planet according to this-produce food. Why because the milk is produced more, the cows should be slaughtered when there is a need of milk? It is so nice foodstuff. So on account of this false nationalism, ""This is my land, this is my land, this is my land..."" And why not take it as God's land and produce enough foodstuff. There will be no scarcity. There will be no skeleton. And distribute it. Where is that consciousness? There is so much land uncultivated all over the world, especially in America, in Australia, and in Africa, so much, huge land, no cultivation. They are keeping some cows and slaughtering them and exporting. What is this? Why don't you produce food?"
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says all of these things, they are known. They know there's enough land and all these nonsense things are happening. He says simply to give this...",Prabhupāda, And therefore knowledge is required.
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : He says that knowledge isn't sufficient. You have to have enough love of mankind so that these things will be put into practice.,Prabhupāda," If you have love of mankind, then you'll kill the cows. That is not love. I love you and kill this man. That is not love. Why? Why for loving you I shall kill him? What is that love? That is not love. Love means... You see the description of love is there, paṇḍitāḥ sama - darśinaḥ ."
M. Roche-dieu,"Yes, but true knowledge is, we think, love.",Prabhupāda," That's all right, but you do not know what is love. You love somebody and you kill others."
M. Roche-dieu,"No, no.",Prabhupāda," That is not love. If you love God, then you will love all His sons."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Here's that verse.,Prabhupāda, Here is the verse.
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara :; (French); Yogeśvara : His point is that he agrees that love alone is not sufficient; there must be knowledge. But he is feeling, I think, a little bit disappointed that up until this point the knowledge that we have been giving him is very elementary. He says there must be some higher knowledge that you know that can actually liberate people. He is looking for that. He wants to know what is that.",Prabhupāda," But if you cannot understand lower knowledge, how you can understand higher knowledge?"
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says that he agrees, he accepts this elementary knowledge, but he says you must have in your teachings some higher knowledge which will permit everyone to do away with this nationalism, to do away with this false ego, and this pride. What is that knowledge?",Prabhupāda," So that knowledge is God consciousness, that just like in my body, your body, his body, what is the important thing? The important thing is the living force. So just like you are a person, I am a person, he is also a person. But what is the important thing in you, in me, and in him? What do you think?"
Yogeśvara; Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates) Is that right? Did I translate?; (French); Yogeśvara : He says that... First of all he is very grateful that we are now approaching these higher spiritual questions. He says his understanding is that this living force inside all of us is the spirit of God that is in every one of us.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : But he says now... But there must be something more than just these words. There must be some way of experiencing that, of realizing that.",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is experiencing, that because the spirit soul is there in you, in me, or anywhere, therefore the body is moving. Just try to understand. And as soon as the spirit soul is out of this body, then it is useless, a lump of matter. Therefore the living force, or the spirit soul, is important. That you have to accept."
Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga; Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates) Was there something else that I missed?; Guru - gaurāṅga : (French); Yogeśvara : Yes.,Prabhupāda," That is admitted? Anything, anything. Just like the big 747 plane is flying but the important thing is there, the pilot. So the motor car, big motor car, big machine, is moving but the important thing is the operator. So if you study that the matter is simply an agency of movement... Real mover is the spirit. You have to admit."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Yes, they are willing to.",Prabhupāda," Then the whole cosmic manifestation, this material nature, there must be also the moving force. That is God. Now, just like within this body I am the person and under my command the body is going, working. I am asking the hand, ""Please come here."" Immediately... So I am also īśvara , means controller. So far this body is concerned, I am the controller. Similarly, the supreme controller, He is called parameśvara , ""the supreme controller."" That is God."
Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,Yogeśvara : You can translate that?; Guru - gaurāṅga : (translates),Prabhupāda," So there are two īśvaras. I am also īśvara . So far my, this body is concerned or my family is concerned, I am controlling. But the supreme controller, He is controlling everything. That is God. So those who are atheists, they must accept that there is the supreme controller, and He is God. So God is controlling everything. There are two things—material and spiritual. We have got experience. Suppose in this city of..."
Swiss Man (4),Geneva.,Prabhupāda," Geneva, there are varieties of living entities and also houses and mountains. So two things, animate and inanimate. One section, animate; another section, inanimate. So we are small gods, or īśvaras. We may control the government and the management of the street and parks and everything, but we are controlled by the supreme. As supreme God, the supreme controller is not controlled by anyone. I am controlling, but I am being controlled by somebody else. That is God. So therefore we have to admit, we must admit that we are not free. We are controlled. Eh? By superior power or superior controller we are controlled. Therefore our duty is to be controlled according to His desire. So if we agree to be controlled by the Supreme, that is perfect life. And if we do not like to come to be controlled by the supreme, that is sinful life. And this is the perfect knowledge."
Swiss Man (1); Guru-gaurāṅga,"(French); Guru - gaurāṅga : He is very happy with your answer. He says, ""I am content.""",Prabhupāda, Thank you.
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : He says that for Christians, this feeling of being with God comes from praying to Lord Jesus Christ. He's asking if Kṛṣṇa has that same position for us.",Prabhupāda," Well, Kṛṣṇa is God, and Christ is son of God. We don't find any difference between the son and the father."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : Kṛṣṇa , he thinks, is an avatāra of Viṣṇu .",Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : Kṛṣṇa , he says, is an avatāra of Viṣṇu ?",Prabhupāda," Well, Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa is the same thing. It is external. Kṛṣṇa ... Somebody says Kṛṣṇa is avatāra of Viṣṇu , and we say that Viṣṇu is expansion of Kṛṣṇa . Now, this example I have already given. Just like one candle. The another, ignite another candle, ignite another candle... Now, all these candles, so far light-giving power the same. But you can call, ""This is first candle. This is second candle."" And if you say the second candle is first candle, so there is no trouble because the candle power is the same."
Yogeśvara; Frenchman; Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He says, do we see Kṛṣṇa as being a savior in the way that Christians see Christ as being the savior?",Prabhupāda," What do you mean by ""savior""?"
Yogeśvara; Frenchman; Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates); (French); Yogeśvara : He say the savior is one who rekindles the spiritual spark that reunites the living being with God. So the savior is in between God and the living being.,Prabhupāda," Savior means who saves you from this material existence. He is called savior. Because the living entity, being entangled in this material existence, he is suffering, so savior means one who saves from this material entanglement and gets him back to God, back to Godhead."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : When they think of the savior, they're talking about the guru , the spiritual master. He's asking, is Kṛṣṇa our guru ? Kṛṣṇa , we consider Kṛṣṇa ...",Prabhupāda," Guru means the representative of God. Just like Christ is son of God, guru is also son of God. So there is no much difference because they will say the same thing, that ""You are suffering in this material world on account of material entanglement. So you give up this business. Come back to home, back to Godhead."" So this is the real message. This message is given by God, by His son, by His servant. The message is the same. If one does not give this message he is neither guru , nor son, nothing of the sort."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : What interests them is the underlying nature of our spiritual practice as opposed to theirs. For example, for them spiritual life is the prayer, salvation in Lord Jesus Christ. And they're not quite sure... They're interested in knowing what is our relationship with Kṛṣṇa . Is it the same or...",Prabhupāda," We are also thinking of Kṛṣṇa always. Eh? Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha - vratāḥ [Bg. 9.14 ] . We are chanting, ""Hare Kṛṣṇa , Hare Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa..."" We are always remembering Kṛṣṇa . So the real process is... Either you think of Kṛṣṇa or son of Kṛṣṇa , it doesn't matter, but you should always think of Him. That is the requisition. That is recommended. That is said in the Bhagavad- gītā , man- manā bhava mad -bhakto mad - yājī māṁ namaskuru , Ninth Chapter."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ [Bg. 18.65 ] .
Nitāi; Nitāi,"Nitāi : [Bg. 9.34 ]:; Nitāi : ""Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.""",Prabhupāda," That's all. Now either you engage your mind in Kṛṣṇa or Jesus does not matter. It is same thing. But this is the process. ""Engage your mind in Me."" Then?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," So we are teaching this, that engage your mind to God or the son of god; it doesn't matter. But your mind should be godly engaged. That's all. That is meditation. That is real meditation: ""Always think of Me."" And in another place, in Sixth Chapter, you see,"
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"(French); Yogeśvara : (translates) And in that situation, always thinking of God like that, our philosophy is that naturally these others things, charity, humanitarian works, they will all come naturally?",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ [SB 5.18.12 ] . As soon as you become a unalloyed devotee of God, all the good qualities will manifest in you. If the good qualities does not manifest in you, that means you are not yet perfect in God consciousness. Just like you European boys, American boys, why you have given... [break] ...one of the item is that good quality that ""Why shall I give trouble, pain, to other animals?"" This is within the God consciousness. Just like poor-feeding. This program we also follow. In our temple, especially in India, any man can come and take his food. Yes. We have got arrangement. In the U.S.A also, Los Angeles, New York, we invite anyone, ""Come and take food."" We don't want to see that anyone is hungry. We don't want to see. So God consciousness means all the good ideas we are manufacturing, they will be manifested in God consciousness automatically. Therefore our duty should be, if we want to make all human being well-behaved, then we must try to make every one of them God conscious."

Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (French conversation),Prabhupāda," We have got 102 centers, and each center you'll find hundred, two hundred, 250 devotees like that. You see the picture. No, no. First picture. All these young boys and girls, how they are happy, you can see from the picture. They have got husband, they have got wife, they have got children."
Young man; Yogeśvara,"Are you from Los Angeles?; Yogeśvara : No, I'm from New York.",Prabhupāda," This picture is of Los Angeles, our Los Angeles temple. That is Los Angeles Deity, and this is Paris Deity here."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara; Young man; Yogeśvara,"(French conversation, prasādam is served); Yogeśvara : Right there. The young man behind you. (French); How well the devotees know the scriptures, in fact, because when you go to...; Yogeśvara : He says one thing, one thing is very impressive, to see how well your disciples know the scriptures.",Prabhupāda," Yes, they have been educated in that way. For education we have so many books. If from child up to the age of eighty years, if one is educated, we have got sufficient stock to give him education."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," We have got our educational institution in Dallas, Gurukula. From small children we are educating to become highest devotee."
Swiss Man (1); Guru-gaurāṅga,"(French); Guru - gaurāṅga : (French) This gentleman says we had difficulties with the police in the beginning. And I said, ""Yes, but then I went, and I gave him all your books, and he read them, and then there were no more difficulties.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, on account of our books we are being appreciated everywhere. In the beginning they might have thought that ""Some of the hippies,"" like that."
Swiss Man (1); Yogeśvara,"Have you been in connection with Aurobindo?; Yogeśvara : Have we been in contact with Aurobindo, Śrī Aurobindo?",Prabhupāda," Why? Why I shall be in contact, Aurobindo?"
Swiss Man (1),Because he's... We know in (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," He does not know better than Kṛṣṇa . So one association is sufficient. There is no need of going this Aurobindo, Saurobindo. We never... Why should we waste our time? We have got sufficient education in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. First of all let us finish these hundred books of four hundred pages. Then we shall see what Aurobindo writes. We don't think anyone can speak better than Kṛṣṇa . That is admitted."
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : (translates),Prabhupāda," Aurobindo was... Aurobindo, Vivekananda, they started talking something in the Western world hundred years ago. But not a single man became Kṛṣṇa devotee."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : (French conversation) They wish to thank you very, very much for your kindness in receiving them.",Prabhupāda, And I thank you for your coming. (chuckles)
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . Give this flower. Thank you.
Swiss Man (1),And God bless you.,Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa . (guests leave) These Aurobindos or Vivekanandas and Gandhis, they have spoiled Hindu culture. Vedic culture they have spoiled. Hodgepodge writing, hodgepodge speaking, dry speaking, speculation-choked up the progress of Vedic civilization. Now here is some hope. People are now taking it. Now, did I say wrong, that ""Why shall I go to Aurobindo?"""
Nitāi,"Nitāi : You never say wrong. (laughs) All of your answers were right, great.",Prabhupāda," I have got better instruction than Aurobindo. Why shall I go to Aurobindo, waste my time? People don't know anything. Nobody has become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa in reading Aurobindo's literature. And here, as soon as they saw our literature, immediately police officer said, ""Oh, you are so high."" Immediately. Where is the record, the professors and universities eager to purchase Aurobindo's book and Vivekananda's books? There is no record. But here they are eager ""All sixty books, please, sir."" ""All twelve books, please, sir."""
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Why are they so attracted to humanitarianism?,Prabhupāda," That is false pride. This has been taught. In the Christianity they have taught like that, giving medicine, open hospital. That is Christianity."
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He admitted it himself. He said himself, ""It's a false pride to think...""",Prabhupāda, That's all.
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : ""...think we can do something.""",Prabhupāda," You cannot do anything. But they show. They make a collection, that ""We are doing such nice work."" The Vivekananda also imitated like that and could not do anything. It is not possible. Swami Nikhilananda said... He belongs to the Vivekananda group. Because they raise funds from America, huge funds, that ""We shall feeding the poor in India."" And they eat meat and big, big become fat, these rascals. So the Americans asked them that ""You are taking away our money somewhere to feed the poor. But when we go to India, two sides we see all poor men are lying on the street. What you have done?"" So this is a slogan. They cannot do anything. Thinking of poor... Now, those who have accepted voluntarily povertyism, the hippies, what you are doing for them? Why don't you make arrangement for their gentlemanly living? They are not poverty-stricken. Why they are living like wretches, lying on the street, no program for eating, no for sleeping, no for bodily comfort, just like animals? What you have done for them?"
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : Because the real problem is not poverty. That they haven't understood.,Prabhupāda," This is karma . If you have bad karma , then you must suffer by the laws of nature. You may be a rich man's son or king's son."
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Christ, he actually also said that. There's one verse in the Bible. Christ said, ""The poor you will always have with you, but I will not be with you always."" He said that also. They misunderstand.",Prabhupāda," Very good idea. Therefore I said Jesus Christ is son of God, so what he says and what Kṛṣṇa says, there is no difference. This has become a hackneyed slogan, ""poor feeding."" To do to the humanity—and cut the throat of the animal. What is this philosophy, nonsense philosophy? They have no conception of God. If he has got conception of God, then everyone — paṇḍitāḥ sama - darśinaḥ [Bg. 5.18 ] . Oh, why for the benefit of the human being, other animals' throat should be cut? Even they have no common sense. National. National means one who is born in that land. That is national. So why the animals born in that land, they are not national?"
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : You used a very nice example, that the children, they are ignorant but that does not mean you kill them.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Is there any meaning, ""Oh, these are foolish children creating trouble, so I will kill them""? What is this?"
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : There was a story in Time magazine last week. Everyone was in a big flurry about it. An airplane crashed in the Andes mountains, and they were stranded way up in the mountains for eighteen days without any food. So there were maybe fifty people on the plane and only eighteen survivors. So because there was no food they ate the bodies. They ate the dead bodies to survive. Then, eighteen days later they were saved. A plane came and picked them up and brought them back. So people are very, very much excited, ""Oh, what is this amazing occurrence, that they ate human flesh?"" But every day they are eating...",Prabhupāda, Cow's flesh. When it was?
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : This was about... Now it is almost a month ago, one month ago.",Prabhupāda, Where it was?

I'm not sure. I don't know for sure. But in the mountains a plane crashed and there were eighteen survivors. And to stay alive they ate the dead bodies of the passengers who died. So there were many articles. ""What was it like?"" Everyone wants to know, ""What was it like to eat human flesh? Do you feel bad now that you have eaten human flesh?"" ""No.""; Guru - gaurāṅga : Who's left a copy of Bhagavad- gītā here?; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Who's left this copy? That's his, this young boy.; Yogeśvara : There have already been books written about it, television reports, radio, everything.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : One thing on that report. I read that there were certain people...",Prabhupāda, There was no vegetable?
Yogeśvara; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Yogeśvara; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Yogeśvara : No, it was way up in the mountains.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Icy, cold.; Yogeśvara : It was very cold. There was no plants, no nothing. They had to stay inside the plane just to stay alive, to stay warm. So they could not go and get food anywhere.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : And the bodies were already dead. And there were certain people that they knew their bodies, his fiance or his sister. They agreed that if they were going to eat the bodies they would eat them last. It's true. It was in the story. One man, he had his prospective wife. One man had his sister or sister-in-law, cousin. They said, ""If we're going to eat the bodies, then we'll eat them the last."" So they had a sense that this body is more important than that body, like that.",Prabhupāda," No, in last war they ate stool also."
Yogeśvara; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,Yogeśvara : Concentration camps.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Really? What is the Vaiṣṇava point of view?,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa,"Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : Is a Vaiṣṇava , is he willing to maintain his body for the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa even if he has to break regulative principles—if it is necessary?",Prabhupāda, If it is necessary.
Yogeśvara; Nitāi,Yogeśvara : What's the name of that yogi who meditated for sixty thousand years?; Nitāi : Saubhari ? Viśvāmitra .,Prabhupāda, Vālmīki.
Yogeśvara; Nitāi,Yogeśvara : No.; Nitāi : Viśvāmitra ?,Prabhupāda, Viśvāmitra .
Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : He also had to eat dog, I think.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yogeśvara,Yogeśvara : There's a story about that.,Prabhupāda," Yes, Viśvāmitra . How they exist in that open, and there was snow. For eating they... Eighteen days?"
Yogeśvara; Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa; Yogeśvara,"Yogeśvara : The plane crashed. Half the people were killed. So the other people, two of them left to go find help. They went to find out some people they could telephone or something. It took them eighteen days to find a house. So the other people, they all stayed close together inside the airplanes. They put on blankets and their coats. But there was no... They could not go outside. There was no food.; Puṣṭa - kṛṣṇa : They had... At first they had little chocolate and they rationed it out that ""You get a little bit of chocolate,"" and little bit of liquid they had. And so they rationed it out until that was finished. Then they took a vote amongst themselves. ""Well, what shall we do? Shall we eat human flesh or shall we simply starve to death?"" So they voted amongst themselves that ""Yes, we should do this."" There were some men, one or two, that would not do it and they died. They refused to do it, and they died. Others, they did.; Yogeśvara : They made some... Afterwards they had to... There was some discussion, some philosophy. They were actually discussing. And there was one person there who was explaining to the others that ""We must eat this flesh to stay alive but it's not so wrong since the soul has left the body."" He said, ""The spirit has left these bodies, so you shouldn't consider it to be quite so bad. We're obliged to do this.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is not unreasonable. It was a question of selection. Otherwise, to subsist, to eat the dead bodies, flesh, that is not very abominable. That can be accepted. But it is the selection whether one will eat. That is another thing. Otherwise dead body's flesh is as good as anything else because it is matter."
Yogeśvara; Guru-gaurāṅga,Yogeśvara : So who is coming?; Guru - gaurāṅga : There is one more meeting today.,Prabhupāda, Where?
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : There is the European Center for Nuclear Research.,Prabhupāda, What can I do there? (laughter)
Guru-gaurāṅga,Guru - gaurāṅga : This man has worked in India... [break],Prabhupāda," ...for B.A. examination. So the father failed, and the daughter passed. Yes, because the old man cannot take education. In Bhāgavata also it is recommended, kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāga ... [SB 7.6.1 ]. Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be taught from the very beginning of life. The more younger, you capture it. Just like we were educated from the very birth by our father. The same thing, what I am doing now in larger scale, I did in my childhood, Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa worship and Ratha - yātrā , the same thing."
Nitāi,"Nitāi : Would you like some refreshment, something to drink or eat?",Prabhupāda, Little fruit and a little this. (end)

Robert Gouiran,"Uh, it's a little difficult to explain, but I made a series of personal experiences which convinced me of the existence of the occult plane.
