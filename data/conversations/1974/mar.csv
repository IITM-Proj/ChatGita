Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : (indistinct) Mahārāja ?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhavānanda,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Oh, about this one. (?); Bhavānanda : Śrīla Prabhupāda asked about this Maṭha .",Prabhupāda," Who, who is he?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : He's a renegade brahmacārī from one of your godbrothers.,Prabhupāda, Prabhupāda dāsa . [break]
Gargamuni,He seems to be helped by Mādhava Mahārāja .,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Gargamuni,He's the one that purchased the land on the north side of us.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : (indistinct) will go tomorrow?,Prabhupāda, Yes. You time fix up. I am ready.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . [break] Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...when I don't remember, ""Get out."" This is Māyāvāda philosophy. ""So long I require your help, I catch your hand. And as soon as I don't require, please get out"" [break]"
Gargamuni,We have Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," Yes. He, he was worshiping Viṣṇu at home, and he was trying to kill Kṛṣṇa . Similarly, there are many Vaiṣṇavas like Jarāsandha -apparently worshiping Viṣṇu —but trying to kill Kṛṣṇa . Jarāsandha - Vaiṣṇava ."
Jayapatākā,So what is the value of such worship of Viṣṇu ?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayapatākā,So what is the benefit of such worship of Viṣṇu ? Jarāsandha worship?,Prabhupāda," They will get material opulence. Asuras, they want material opulence. They, they do not understand what is spiritual life or spiritual happiness, what is devotional service. Neither they'd like to understand. Which way?"
Jayapatākā,Left here. [break],Prabhupāda, ...we heard from...?
Gurukṛpā,From the Ganges?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā; Jayapatākā,From the Ganges?; What is this land? (?) [break],Prabhupāda," ""...near the brahmajyoti, I don't want. Now I have merged."" This is Māyāvāda theory."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Jayapatākā; Madhudviṣa,"Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : This is all that silt from the Ganges River, Prabhupāda.; This man, he wants to sell this land, seventeen bighās, for seven hundred rupees. [break]; How is that possible?",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Madhudviṣa,How is the Ganges flowing through the planetary systems?,Prabhupāda, So? It is not possible?
Madhudviṣa,"I don't know. It is possible, but it is incomprehensible.",Prabhupāda, Everything is incomprehensible. How the planets are floating in this air?
Madhudviṣa,Because Kṛṣṇa is in them.,Prabhupāda," Then, similarly, Kṛṣṇa desires; everything is possible."
Jayapatākā,Madhudviṣa Mahārāja has given us only his T-shirt.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayapatākā; Madhudviṣa,"He has given us nice shirt, Gaura - Nitāi .; Yes. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...is a great opportunity, this taking bath along with the Vaiṣṇavas in the Ganges at Navadvīpa ."
Jayapatākā,"By your mercy, you have given us such a great opportunity, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . It is all respectively. You are all Vaiṣṇavas. To take bath along with you is a great opportunity.
Gurukṛpā; Bhavānanda,"A great opportunity to be purified. [break]; Bhavānanda : ...spiritual master. Then when he reaches a certain point, he lets go. What is...? What becomes of Him? He is also Māyāvādī .",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is Māyāvādī philosophy. [break] ...philosophy, cakhudāna dilo yei janme janme prabhu sei . Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings that, ""One who has opened my eyes, my spiritual master, he's my father, life after life."" So how he can, he can say, ""Go away now""? That is Māyāvāda philosophy. (end)"
Nitāi,Nitāi : What's the story behind the rediscovery of Māyāpura?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Nitāi,Nitāi : Is there some story related to the way in which Māyāpura was found by Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī?,Prabhupāda," The Ganges is going sometimes that side, then this side. So it was under the impression that original Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthsite is now under water. Or there were many theories and suggestions. Later on, Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī said that ""Here is the..."" Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
Nitāi,"Nitāi : In previous days, it was a very big city.",Prabhupāda, (Bengali)
Indian,Ācchā. (end),Prabhupāda," ...every payasā you should spend for Kṛṣṇa . Not that ""Kṛṣṇa is giving money. Let us squander it as much as we like."" Then there will be scarcity. [break] What is that?"
Jayapatākā,This is a short cut.,Prabhupāda," Oh, all right. [break] ...pūjyante dhanya yatra sucancitam (?), ""Where a rascal is not worshiped, where foodstuff is kept very carefully,"" and dam - patyoḥ kalaha nāsti, ""and when there is no fight between husband and wife, or family-wise,"" tatra śrīḥ svayam āgataḥ , ""there goddess of fortune is always present."" Hare Kṛṣṇa . This is the principle given by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita , the greatest politician and moralist. Mūrkha means who is not pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa . He's a mūrkha or mūḍha . Not that ABCD learned. ABCD learned is no use. And another śloka , Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says who is learned man. Mātṛvat para - dāreṣu : ""One who does not think of any illicit sex life."" Mātṛvat... Every woman-mother. Except his married wife, every woman is mother. Mātṛvat para - dāreṣu para -loṣṭravat ""And others' money, just like garbage."" Nobody touches. Mātṛvat para - dāreṣu para -dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, and ātmavat sarva - bhūteṣu : ""And one who sees like himself all other living entities, he's paṇḍita , he's learned."" Not by MA , Ph.D. Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ... yaḥ paśyati . Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu . [break] ... nihāram iva bhā ... It is called nihāra. As long, as soon as the sun becomes strong, immediately, everything finished. Just see. This... What is called fog, or...?"
Jayapatākā,"Just like when you came to the West, Prabhupāda, you cleared away the fog.",Prabhupāda," At least, I tried for that. Whatever is done it is done by Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...keeps intelligent to the sincere servant. Otherwise, everything is done by Kṛṣṇa . So if you, one is sincere to Kṛṣṇa , he will act everything rightly because the direction is... Buddhi yogaṁ dadāmi tam . The perfect direction is there. I do not know why people denies to take direction from Kṛṣṇa . He gets perfect direction. But he does not like to take. What is this tree?"
Jayapatākā,"The imli, I think.",Prabhupāda, Imli.
Jayapatākā,Not imli? They call that...,Prabhupāda," No, no, not imli. Imli's different. This way, up to that river? [break] ... vāsudeva - parāyaṇa . Vāsudeva - parāyaṇa , means Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they solve all questions by one thing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Exactly like the sun solves all the problems of this nihāra, foss. It is called foss?"
Jayapatākā,Fog.,Prabhupāda, Fog.
Jayapatākā,Mist.,Prabhupāda," Nihāram iva bhāskara . Let the scientists do it in their scientific way, drive away the fog. Is there any process? Eh? In the ocean, when there is fog like this, they have to stop all the ships and cry, (makes sound like fog horn:) onnnh, onnnh, so that they may not collide. I have seen it when I was coming, going to USA . Where is Mohanānanda? He is here? No. Mohanānanda? Hare Kṛṣṇa . The difference between other camps and our: they call these men from their daily, I mean to say, life, householder's life, for this purpose for a week or so, but they are not dedicated. Here, in our camp, all our people are dedicated to the cause. That is the difference. So they cannot surpass your activities."
Jayapatākā,"Because you are dedicated, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes, everyone should be dedicated, I or you. Does not... That is the success of life. Dedicate your life for Kṛṣṇa . That is the perfection. Even there are some faults, even dedicated life is noble life. Maybe, due to our past habits, we may commit some faulty action, but that dedicated life is sublime. Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya - bhāk , sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. 9.30 ] ."
Jayapatākā,"This, from this... This is the land that we want to get. It starts from here. And that's our land there. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...immediately appreciates Kṛṣṇa's intelligence. Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā -bhāvikī... [Cc. Madhya 13.65 , purport]. It is being done as if automatically, but no, there is brain. That brain, these rascals, they cannot find out. Machine, nature only. What is this nature? Nonsense. So which way we shall go? This way? Up to the river?"
Jayapatākā,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Each and every grain...
Jayapatākā,Here's our mango tree.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Viṣṇujana,Mango.,Prabhupāda, Mango tree?
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : Yes, we planted, uh... (end)",Prabhupāda," ...no woman can... [break] So I took it very a cheap price. There was no question of woman. I kept my office there. And the address was Multani temple. It is a temple. Multani temple, Grant Road. And in my retired life my office was there, Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa temple and Delhi, Chippiwada. And my residence was Rādhā - Dāmodara temple. And before that, that Keśī Ghāṭa . Who has seen that? You have...?"
Devotee,Oh yes.,Prabhupāda, That was also temple. Yes.
Indian devotee; Indian devotee,"Kṛṣṇa has arranged.; Very nice side, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, I lived in that house for seven years. And then I came to Rādhā - Dāmodara temple.
Devotee,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Which way? [break] ...stayed in that Rādhā - Kṛṣṇa temple, Malliks. And still I am living in temple. So Kṛṣṇa has arranged nicely, from the beginning of my life, temple. Which way? This way? [break] Medhi , this is called medhi , this rod, center. So the, the bull is bound up with it and he goes round, goes around. All day. So gṛhamedhī means center is home, and he goes round. Throughout the whole life. They are called gṛhamedhīs."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : This is called medhi .,Prabhupāda," Medhi , yes. Another medhi means killing. So one who keeps himself in household life, he kills himself. Killing, Gṛhamedhī . And that is little long term meaning. But this is the direct meaning. The medhi rod is there, and he simply... He's very busy. Busy means within few feet. But he's thinking he's very busy. Anyone got, he has got home, and he's simply rounding about. Anywhere you go. The center is that. And what is that gṛha ? Where? Which way?"
Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhur gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate . The gṛham , house, is not actually gṛha . Gṛha means the wife. Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhuḥ . Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate . So to become householder means one must have a wife. So actually round the wife. Gṛhamedhī . Round the wife. And what is wife means, everyone knows. It means round that thing. Is that good analysis?"
Devotees,Jaya .,Prabhupāda," Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ucyate . [break] ...explain. It is not my manufacture. What is said? Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi , yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi , yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi ... [break] ... tuccham . The gṛhamedhī's happiness, what is that happiness? Maithunādi. Sex. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukham . Gṛhamedhi - sukham [SB 7.9.45 ] . Those who are gṛhamedhīs"", what is their happiness? Sex. That's all. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukham . And what is that sex? Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha - duḥkham . It is itching between the two hands. Kaṇḍūyanena kara . But the, after that itching, there is very bad effect. Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha - duḥkham . That is unhappiness. Therefore tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ [SB 7.9.45 ] . Those who are kṛpaṇāḥ , they are not satisfied. They want to do it... (end of recording)"
Viṣṇujana,"And there were only two Hindu gentlemen in the village and still, the Mohammedans received us and arranged for our kīrtana and prasādam distribution.",Prabhupāda, Very nice.
Viṣṇujana,We felt it was Nityānanda's grace.,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa . Yes.
Viṣṇujana,"First we were afraid. Haridāsa Brahmacārī told me: ""Oh, these are Mohammedans. They'll not help us in any way, nor will they accept prasādam . "" But then I said let us go...",Prabhupāda," No, no. Everyone will help us. Maybe... In that way sometimes Hindus are also against. It is not the Mohammedans. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's time, even the Hindus were against His movement, the brāhmaṇas. They complained to the Kazi that ""This is not Hindu movement."" You see? The saṅkīrtana movement. Therefore Kazi had to take steps to stop the saṅkīrtana movement. So Kazi took step on the ground of complaint by the Hindus."
Nitāi,Nitāi : That's similar to what happened in Bombay.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Nitāi,Nitāi : That's similar to what happened...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Nitāi,Nitāi : ...in Bombay.,Prabhupāda," The Hindus, they wanted to break our temple, and they broke part of it. You do not know? Oh, how is that? There was a great agitation. By the instruction of the municipality, being bribed by the other party. You, you have not heard that we had so much...?"
Devotee,"Not heard, no.",Prabhupāda, How is that? It was very well...
Jayapatākā,"In our exhibition booth, we have put up articles about it. India exhibition. Bombay has exhibited the matter.",Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma ... [break] ...to take evening walk. This part, on the field, agricultural field. [break] ...if you have any land to purchase immediately, then I can ask Mahadevia, He can pay for that. [break] ...Americans without machine, they cannot sleep. They must smell, ""Here is a machine."" Then they can sleep. There was a fisherman. So at, in the evening... That is still in India. In the evening you can ask shelter from any householder's house. They'll give you shelter. So he came in the evening, ""Sir, I want to pass night in your home."" ""All right, you are welcome."" So the fisher basket, fishing basket. ""You keep this here, outside, and you sleep inside."" So whole day, he was restless. Then whole night, he could not sleep. Then the master said, ""You are not sleeping?"" ""No, sir."" ""Why?"" ""Now, because my baskets are kept outside."" ""What is in the basket?"" ""No, unless I smell, I cannot sleep."" (laughter) So these Americans, unless they smell about machine, they cannot sleep. ""Habit is the second nature."" For ordinary muscle work, they'll bring so many machines. I have seen. Karandhara was doing. At least that machine must come. (Makes sound like machine:) kat kat kat kat kat kat kat kat. Making hole. That machine is compulsory."
Devotee,"Recently, Prabhupāda, I saw one machine for...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,"For rubbing the nails, there is a battery operated machine.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Machine for cleansing, so many things."
Devotee,And for nail rubbing also.,Prabhupāda, Yes. For massaging. Everything.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: They have for brushing the teeth.,Prabhupāda," Oh, very..."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: You just hold the toothbrush and the machine makes it go up and down.,Prabhupāda, Just see.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: Some scientists, they want to make all the different body parts. They want to give artificial arm, then artificial feet, and they're, they're spending all kinds of money and time making these complicated machinery to do the same thing that the body is doing. And the ultimate goal, these scientists were stating, their ultimate goal was to make a complete human body so that the person never has to die, but he can always change his body just before it breaks.",Prabhupāda, But the maker of that machine will die.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yes.,Prabhupāda," He cannot save himself. He can make a machine which will not die, but he will die. Is that all right?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," How much perfect he is, that you can consider, that he's making something perfect which will not die, but he will die. So he's imperfect. So how his machine is perfect? This is common argument. He's imperfect. But he cannot make such machine that he will not die."
Satsvarūpa,They say in the future they will...,Prabhupāda," Oh, that is, that is a... Kicking, they on their face. That is the only loophole on which we can kick on their face. You see? They are making machine perfect, but they cannot make themselves perfect. Why don't you ask that ""Why don't you make a machine that you'll not die? Your machine will not die, I accept. You're so perfect. But why you will die? Why you will die?"" What is their answer?"
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: They say that they will get to a point where, when each cause of their death, maybe, say, a bad heart, then they can get an artificial heart.",Prabhupāda," All right, you can get everything. You will do it. But why don't you do it for yourself that you will not die?"
Satsvarūpa,"They'll say, ""That's all right. I'm working for posterity so that people who come in future generations...""",Prabhupāda," What posterity. You cannot take help from your machine. What posterity you will take? It is nonsense. You are starving, and you, you want to speak that ""I will distribute prasādam . "" What is this nonsense? You are starving, and you are proud of distributing food to others. Is that very good reason, a reasonable proposal? What...? First of all, you stop your starvation. Then you can say, ""Now I have stopped my starvation. I'll distribute food to the hungry men."""
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: All the scientists and leaders are all like that. They don't have the vaguest idea. They don't have the vaguest idea...,Prabhupāda, Therefore we...
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: ...of anything.,Prabhupāda," ...call them rascals and fools. They may advertise themselves as scientists, but we take them as rascals and fools."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: Some of them so much want to be God, they're thinking they're going to create life and make bodies and this and that.",Prabhupāda," The only question is that first of all, keep your life. Then you cure another life. Life in you is already there. Now keep it. Protect it by some machine or by some chemical. Then you talk all this nonsense. What do you think, Viṣṇujana Mahārāja ?"
Viṣṇujana,"At the fairs in the United States, they have exhibits of what the scientists are doing, and one scientist has actually invented a machine... Costs one hundred thousand dollars, and this machine can take the head of a man from his body and keep the brain cells still going, and they expect that this machine, they expect, they haven't done it to anyone because no one will do it...",Prabhupāda, That expectation is always there. Any fool can expect anything. That is another thing.
Viṣṇujana,But they've done it with goat head.,Prabhupāda," We are concerned what you are doing now. That's all. We are not for expectation, future hope. We do not believe in that. Trust no future, however pleasant. It may be pleasant to you, but we don't believe it. You rascals, you can feel, but history shows that after death, no brain works. So we take this simple conclusion, that this brain is useless. So am I right or wrong?"
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: You are right.,Prabhupāda," Sudāmā Vipra , you are very critical. You can say. Am I right or wrong?"
SudāmāVipra,Sudāmā Vipra : You're right. (laughter),Prabhupāda," Thank you. That's... Svarūpa Dāmodara asked the scientist that, ""You are beginning life from chemicals. Suppose I give you chemicals, can you make life?"" ""That I cannot say."" This is their proposal. This is their... All rascals. And they're wasting public money and making other fools. They're going to the Candraloka and this loka , Venus. Simply wasting time. This remark I gave in the newspaper sometimes in San Francisco..."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: When they asked about the moon.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. It is simply waste of time and energy. That's all. And in 1968 I wrote that Easy Journey: ""And this is all childish."""
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Sputniks.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Have you read that?
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yes. It is very nice.,Prabhupāda," So we can boldly say on the strength of Vedic literature that all these attempts are childish and those who are attempting, they're all fools and rascals. That's all. Now they're silent about moon expedition. They're trying to go to Venus. What happened to moon, moon planet?"
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yeah right.,Prabhupāda, Another diversion. That's all.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Just wasting money and time.,Prabhupāda, Another diversion of attention so that they can exploit public money in that way. And the public is also fooled that they believe all this nonsense.
Viṣṇujana,"In the United States, Prabhupāda, the rocks that they brought back from the moon are being displayed in all the different cities. They have little small pieces of the rocks from the moon. And people stand in long lines...",Prabhupāda, Just see...
Viṣṇujana,...to come and see these little pieces of rock.,Prabhupāda, ...how much rascal you are.
Viṣṇujana,And they have guards all around the little rocks.,Prabhupāda, Gods?
Viṣṇujana,"With guns, with guns.",Prabhupāda," Oh, guards."
Viṣṇujana,With guns. So no one will steal.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Siddha-svarūpānanda; Devotee,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: That is their Deity. They are worshiping. They have guards.; They don't pray God, who has made all of this.",Prabhupāda," No, that one, I mean to say, rogue, thief, came to a bank manager. Somewhere in Western countries. And he brought some lotions. So he said that ""I shall mix up these lotions. Immediately the whole bank will be blown up."" So he became afraid because the scientists do that. So... ""So you give me check immediately, two hundred millions or something, otherwise I'll mix it."" So he gave him that check. And... Because they were... ""It is time bomb. If you call police or arrest me within this time, then it will blown up."" So in this way, he took away the check. And after sometimes, he phoned to the police, ""This is the situation. Come and help us. Here is a time bomb on my table."" So police came. They also took it very carefully in the chemical laboratory. And in the chemical lab, they were also afraid. Then they saw it is glycerin. That's all. Such fools are there. You see. It is simply exploiting the innocent public of their money, hard-earned money. That's all. And if you go to such foundation that ""Give us some money for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, printing these books,"" ""No, no. We are not interested in religion. We are for scientific improvement, glycerin."""
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Rational. They think they are very rational.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Rational. A dog is also rational. But a dog is dog, a man is man. Dog, if a dog is called, ""Hut"", he's not rational? He'll stop immediately. So is not rational?"
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yeah.,Prabhupāda," That is rational. One who has got reason. ""So this man wants to check me."" So he stops. For eating, he has rational, what is his eatable. Dog does not like preparation made with too much ghee. They will like meat, rotten meat, and dried bones. That is rational. ""This is my food."""
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And similarly, hog also, he likes to eat stool than halavā. He has got rationality. As you will not eat stool, you will like halavā, you have got rationality, then hog has got rationality. He'll not eat halavā, he'll eat stool. So where is the want of rationality? Why don't you eat stool? That is rationality. So similarly, he does not eat halavā. So where is the difference between you in the matter of rationality? You deny something, he denies something. Where is want of rationality?"
Jayapatākā,"Bhavānanda has said that in his previous life he had a pet pig, and he used to offer the pig sweet, but the pig would take the sweet and... He would not eat it. He would roll it in dirt. And when it is filled with dirt, then only he would eat.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: It tasted so bad, he had to have something that tasted good around it so that he could get it down.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) It is not for the hog, but a human being... I had a friend. If you give him rasagullā, he'll want little salt. Rasagullā with little salt, he'll eat. Without salt, he cannot eat. And my father, he was, at the last stage of his taking, some rice mixed with milk. While eating that, he'll take a little curry also. So it is a taste."
Jayapatākā; Parivrājakācārya; Jayapatākā,"Paramahaṁsa and Parivrājakācārya were preaching in... Where was that? The East? What is that nation? Siam?; Thailand.; Thailand. And there they would offer the people rasagullā, but they would put soy sauce on it.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayapatākā,They would put this bitter sauce on it. Then only they would take.,Prabhupāda," And in Burma, my Guru Mahārāja opened a branch. So when they were frying puri , the, nice ghee, all the tenants, ""Oh! What you are...!?"" (laughter) They cannot tolerate. But in Burma, there is a preparation which is called nafi. The nafi means that a, a big jar will be kept on the door, and whatever animals, insect, cockroaches will die, they'll put in that. And during rainy season, it will be filled with water. And it will be kept for years. Then... And the bad smell was so terrible that if somebody would open the lid, it will immediately create very bad smell. So after some years, they will strain the water and keep in bottle. And when there is festival, they'll supply it in small... That is called nafi. And they'll take it very pleasantly. And when they were frying ghee, ""Oh! What you are doing, this?!"" Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that"
Devotee,No. Nobody would.,Prabhupāda," So the Brahman realization is like that. Every living entity, he wants ānanda . Ānanda means just like we are walking together, talking together. This is ānanda . If I would have walked alone, it would have been no ānanda . I do not like. Nobody likes. So ānanda means there must be entourage. Therefore ānanda is with Kṛṣṇa . When we play with Kṛṣṇa , we dance with Kṛṣṇa , talk with Kṛṣṇa , serve Kṛṣṇa , take care of Kṛṣṇa , then there is ānanda . And simply to become one with the Brahman , then you will have to fall down again. Therefore jñāna - kāṇḍa is not perfect. And karma - kāṇḍa is, you can migrate from one body to another or one planet to another. You'll be brahmāṇḍa bhramite . You have to wander. And jñāna - kāṇḍa means you merge. That is also intolerable. Therefore unless you come to bhakti - kāṇḍa , there is no question of real life and bliss. That is the conclusion."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yes.,Prabhupāda," And after eating meat, then seven hundred years old loaf. Cut it and add with little butter. That's all. And then take wine. Bās. Kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare . Now they're eating rasagullā. Am I right or wrong?"
Devotees; Siddha-svarūpānanda,Right.; Siddha -svarūpānanda: I didn't hear what you said. Now they're eating...,Prabhupāda, Explain.
Jayapatākā; Siddha-svarūpānanda; Jayapatākā; Devotee; Viṣṇujana; Jayapatākā,"Previously they were only eating meat. Now they're taking rasagullā.; Siddha -svarūpānanda: Oh yes.; So their taste has improved.; That is our kīrtana party.; Yes.; Ācchā, the way back we passed. Do you want to go back yet or around to the end?",Prabhupāda," Eh? [break] ...In every life, there is āvaraṇātmikā- śakti . He'll think that ""I am very well situated."" Even in the hog's life. That is māyā . Similarly, even if you are thinking, ""Now we have got human body. We are well situated than the hog,"" that is also mistake. That is also mistake. ""I am European, American, I have got so comfortable."" Everything is wrong. Because you have to transmigrate. You do not know what is the next life. So what is the meaning of this well-situated. That is the mistake. That is māyā . You are not sure that you'll continue this life. You'll have to die. You have to accept. So this is māyā . Somebody well-situated, he's thinking, ""Oh, I haven't got to do anything with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I am well situated. I am European and American."""
Jayapatākā,Watch out here.,Prabhupāda," Where is our... [break] ( kīrtana - party in background) ...that ""Europeans and Americans will come, and they will dance here with the chanting, ""Jaya Śacīnandana, Jaya Śacīnandana!"" So that is being done."
Devotee,"That is being done. By the mercy of Prabhupāda Mahārāja , everything has become possible.",Prabhupāda," Oh... So when they chant and dance, I simply remember Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. That's all. I pray to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, ""Now they have come to your shelter. Give them protection."" That's all. What can I do more? I cannot do anything more. [break]"
Devotee,... bhakti - mārga . And ours is also bhakti - mārga .,Prabhupāda, Yes. They are Vaiṣṇava .
Devotee,Then what is the difference in our philosophy and...,Prabhupāda," No, that is not different. That is variety, that they worship Bāla - Kṛṣṇa , and we worship Kiśora - Kṛṣṇa . We worship Bāla - Kṛṣṇa also. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava , they worship all kinds of pastimes of Kṛṣṇa . But they specially stress on Bāla - Kṛṣṇa , child Kṛṣṇa . That is spiritual variety. There is no difference. That is not difference. Cid-vaicitra. The exact name is cid-vaicitra. Cit means spiritual. Vaicitra means varieties. Where this road goes?"
Jayapatākā,This one goes down on the river side. (?),Prabhupāda, Hmm. So... [break]

Devotee,... Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa very prominent.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Devotee,The Vaiṣṇavas before...,Prabhupāda," No, other Vaiṣṇavas. But... The on... This Vaiṣṇava party, they stress on Bāla - Kṛṣṇa , Gopāla . We also, we have got our Gopāla , as Mādhavendra Purī installed a Gopāla . That Gopāla is now worshiped, Nāthavara (?), by the Vallabha - sampradāya . That is Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Deity. It is admitted in the court. [break] ...the modern civilization is that they do not know that this, there is transmigration of the soul, and this constant change of body is not very good. They do not know anything. Neither they do know that there is change of body. Neither they feel that ""The constant change of body is not very good. If there is any remedy?"" These rascals, they do not find the final remedy. They are busy with the temporary problems. Real problem they set aside. [break] ...simply being bewildered by the three guṇas, sattva - rajo -tamo- guṇa , they do not know the ultimate goal is Kṛṣṇa . They do not know it. That is stated in Bhagavad- gītā ."
Siddha-svarūpānanda; Jayapatākā; Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: It's better this way.; Let's go down this side, this way.; Siddha -svarūpānanda: [break] ...body when it's old and wears out, and yet they're spending all their energy...",Prabhupāda," No, he desires. He creates his body. Just like the, sometimes the Mohammedans, they think that tiger is the best life. Sera . Sera . Wa (?) sera haya . Means to become a tiger is the perfection of..."" You become sera . That's all. Kṛṣṇa gives... He is within the heart. ""All right, I'll give you chance. Become a sera . "" But when he becomes sera , he does not eat for months. You'll never find a sera very fatty. Because he cannot eat. Every animal knows, ""There is a tiger."" They avoid. By chance, he can hunt out."
Viṣṇujana,Farrow.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Viṣṇujana,The farrow bird.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣṇujana,He'll call.,Prabhupāda," This is the position. ""You wanted to become a sera . All right, you become a sera . Jump over some animal and immediately suck his blood."" All facility is—the nails, the teeth-given. But is he happy? But everyone thinking that ""If I could become like this, I would have been happy."" So Kṛṣṇa gives all chance. ""All right, you become this."" This is transmigration. This is transmigration. [break] ...yathāndhair upa ... We are thinking something like that, and Kṛṣṇa is giving us chance, ""All right, you take this chance; you become like this."" Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. 4.11 ] . But it will not make you happy. Therefore ultimately says, sarva - dharmān . ""You give up all this rascaldom. What I speak, you can accept. That is your dharma ."" Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam ... [Bg. 18.66 ]. That will be beneficial for you, the most confidential instruction. There is that story that one old woman, she was suffering. And she had to collect woods from the forest and sell in the market. So one day, how do you say, she was praying to Kṛṣṇa , or God, that ""Kindly help me. I am in very poverty-stricken."" So one day, she was carrying that load of fuel. It fell down. So nobody was there to help him. So she began to cry, ""Who will help me?"" So she began to pray to God ""Kindly help me."" And God came: ""What do you want?"" ""Who are you, Sir?"" ""I am God."" ""Kindly help me to take this burden on my head."" Yes. ""All right."" From God, she's asking, ""Please help me to get this burden on my head."" That's all. So everyone is going on, ""Let family be very happy, my son be married. He may... Let him pass MA examination."" But it is the same thing, ""Give me the burden on my head."" This is the prayer. Mūḍhāḥ . Na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . The life was meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa and worship Him, and he's asking, ""Give me the burden on my head."" Therefore mūḍha , rascal, fool. He's asking something which will never make him happy, even by merging into the effulgence, Brahman effulgence. It will never make him happy. But he does not know. Therefore he's mūḍha , rascal."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: That's a very clear example.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,Siddha -svarūpānanda: Very clear.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everyone is asking, ""Please help me to get this burden on my head."" Everyone is asking. [break] Kṛṣṇa mantra means asking nothing from Kṛṣṇa , but only praying, ""Please engage me in Your service."" This is Hare Kṛṣṇa . Now let him engage, whatever service He likes. I don't dictate that ""Give me this service."" That is also sense gratification. As soon as I'll say that ""Engage me in this type of service,"" that is also sense gratification. When one surrenders fully that ""Engage me in Your service in whatever way You like,"" that is pure devotion. You cannot dictate Kṛṣṇa . Because He wants, sarva - dharmān ... ""First of all surrender, then I will give you. I will allot what kind of service you can do."" Sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam , ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva ... [Bg. 18.66 ]. But if I dictate, then Kṛṣṇa will be..., ""All right, you take this."" Then you again become unhappy. Don't dictate Kṛṣṇa . Be dictated. That is happiness. But everyone is dictating, ""Please give me this. Give me this. Give me that. Give me that. Give me this."" Why should you dictate Kṛṣṇa ? As soon as I dictate, that is my sense gratification. That is not pure devotion. Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam . Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [ Brs. 1.1.11] . Make zero all your desires. It doesn't matter, this desire or that desire. Any kind of desire. Whatever you desire, that is material. Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ] . That is pure devotee."
Devotee,That takes practice.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee,"That takes practice, to stop desiring for oneself.",Prabhupāda, Yes. And therefore...
Devotee,You have to practice...,Prabhupāda," ...the practice is that you should simply desire what your spiritual master says. Don't desire yourself. Yasya prasādād bhagavat - prasādaḥ **. If you fulfill the desires of your spiritual master, then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased."" Because he's the representative, the immediate representative, boss, if you satisfy him, the master, supreme master, is also satisfied. If he gives report, ""This clerk is doing nice,"" that is sufficient. Yasya prasādād bhagavat - prasādaḥ **. This is the injunction."
Jayapatākā,"So human life was no advantage. Only because you have come, now it can be advantage.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayapatākā,"Human life is no special advantage. Only if you come, the spiritual master comes, then it can be some advantage.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore Vedic injunction is gurum eva abhigacchet: ""You must go to a bona fide spiritual master if you want to make your life perfect."" There is no question whether I shall go or not. ""You must!"" That is the beginning of human life. Otherwise animal life. He has no spiritual master. He's not going to obey anyone. He's working in his own whims. That is animal life. Real life here begins."
Devotee,(Bengali),Prabhupāda, (Bengali)
Devotee,They're self-interested. They're making money and forgetting the public.,Prabhupāda," That's all. Godless. They must be like that. Gandhi was a student of Bhagavad- gītā — never taught about Kṛṣṇa . This is his knowledge of Bhagavad- gītā , Bhagavad- gītā without Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotee,"They want the material after killing the source. After killing the cows, they want milk. After...",Prabhupāda," Gandhi was approached by the Hindus that ""You are doing so much for the Mohammedans. The Mohammedans are obedient. So why don't you stop this cow killing?"" ""How can I interfere with their religious?"" Just see."
Devotee,This is...,Prabhupāda," ""Cow killing is religion."" And he was such a fool that if somebody said that ""Cutting the throat of others is my religion,"" he would allow, ""Yes, you can do that."""
Jayapatākā; Devotee,"Go this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]; ...proof that the cause of cancer is beef-eating.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,I have...,Prabhupāda, Leprosy. Leprosy is also due to beef-eating. Get it folded.
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: The third greatest cause of accidental death in, in the world...",Prabhupāda, Is intoxication.

Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: But the, this one is the choking on meat at dinner table and dying, suffocating. It's very wide-spread. And in restaurants, while they're eating meat, they get so into eating, they want to swallow to eat the next piece. So they, before chewing enough, they have a big lump of meat in the mouth, and they swallow and they choke. They get caught. So in many big restaurants, they have these fancy forks like this that if somebody's choking, they go to the table, a very nice waiter, and he sticks the thing down the throat and pulls out the meat. Then the person can continue eating. But it is a very high cause of death in the world. They choke on meat.",Prabhupāda," Just like dog. Dog, if you give..."

If somebody gives me check, one million dollar, payable three hundred years after, shall I be inclined to accept such check? So why these fools accepting this post-dated check?"
Viṣṇujana,"Prabhupāda, they say they've already done so much. The scientists will say...",Prabhupāda, What they have done? What they have done? Why people are starving? What you have done?
Viṣṇujana,But they'll say we have created so much machineries and gone to the moon.,Prabhupāda," You cannot eat machine. You produce. You produce rice, wheat in the machine. What you have done? You have simply misled the people that instead of tilling the ground, they have come to machine, and there is no food."
Siddha-svarūpānanda,"Siddha -svarūpānanda: Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda," You have done this. You have, on the false plea that ""We'll give you five hundred rupees salary. You come in the city and be engaged."" Oh, he saw, ""Oh, I am simply producing my food. If I get five hundred rupees, then I'll go to cinema, I'll have a good dress."" Now there is no food even. You have done this. That's all. What is the benefit of this machine. Machine benefit is that we were purchasing, when there was no so much machine, in our childhood, three rupees, four annas per mound, first-class rice. Now we are purchasing one Kg."
Devotee,Ten rupees Kg. For one rupee (indistinct) first-class wheat.,Prabhupāda," Just see. So if one is rascal, they will be misled by this. Otherwise, any sane man will not accept. They say that, ""We have done so much."" What you have done? You have done this. At least in India, the effect of machine and factories: that there is no rice, no food."
Devotee,With the machines they're mixing stones in the rice.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee,"With machine help, they're mixing stone in the rice.",Prabhupāda," That's it. That's it, that you cannot get. Oh, you have done so much. But India is not meant for machine. These rascals, they do not know. India is, India's culture is plain living, high thinking. You require some food. Produce food, and take it, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa .

Guest,Support the right minority?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guest,Support the right minority?,Prabhupāda," There is no question of minority. Support the right person. Kṛṣṇa supported Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in place of Duryodhana. So formerly it was monarchy. That is perfect politics. This democracy is useless. It has proved. One man, the king, he should be properly educated how to rule, what is the aim of ruling, how the people will be, I mean to say, culturally elevated, what is that culture. [break] There was a consulting board of learned brāhmaṇas and saintly persons. They would advise the monarch how to rule."
Jayapatākā,This is... This is the land here.,Prabhupāda, This is the land?
Jayapatākā; Śyāmasundara,"Yeah, we're walking over it. We're going through... [break]; Elizabeth, in England, she's got a..., what she calls a ""think-tank"" or a board of advisors who meet and advise her on different policies.",Prabhupāda, Privy council.
Śyāmasundara,"Something like that. It's called a ""think-tank"". She's named it. It's presided over by Lord, Lord Goodman.",Prabhupāda," No, no. The thing is, unless the people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, either this board or that board, that will not help. First of all, people should know what is the aim of life, what is culture, how the human activity should be directed. The people should know first of all this. Otherwise, changing from frying pan to the fire, it is useless. That is going on. That change, revolution, is going on. Just like the Russian people, they changed the Czarist government into communist government, revolution, but still, they're unhappy. They're trying to change by another revolution. This is going on. Punaḥ punaś carvita - carvaṇānām [SB 7.5.30 ] . This is described in the śāstra as ""chewing the chewed."" Or the same simple philosophy: ""This side of stool is better than that side."" So he keeps the whole thing, stool. ""This side, the dry side, is better and the moist side, wet side, is bad."" This is no philosophy. It, it must not be stool. It must be gold. Then it is all right, this side or that side. That philosophy, that the dry side of stool is better than the wet side, this will not help. So first, first of all, human society must know what is the aim of life. Na te viduḥ svārtha- gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB 7.5.31 ] . We are part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa , Viṣṇu . We are suffering on account of our relationship with God. This is the cause of our suffering. Then we have to make plan how to revive our lost relationship with God. Then the... Everything is there in the Vedic literature. All directions are there. So we have to... Just like when we are in danger, we consult some learned man or physician or a lawyer, similarly we have to consult the Vedic culture, how perfect it is. This way?"
Jayapatākā,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Then everything is there. You haven't got to manufacture anything. And the Bhagavad- gītā is the gist idea of all Vedic culture. And our propaganda is to establish that gist idea of Bhagavad- gītā . That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So therefore I am asking. ""What is the politics of Kṛṣṇa ?"" Kṛṣṇa's politics was to have a king of the world which..., Kṛṣṇa conscious, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa . That is the Kṛṣṇa's politics. He wanted to replace. So the first politic is to replace these so-called leaders, demons. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Where is that land? This land?"

Jayapatākā,You're talking. So I don't want to interrupt.,Prabhupāda, Oh.

Jayapatākā,"They may have gone back to the temple now. This land... I'm sending... Because land, different land takes different time, so I'm sending both information out for this land here-It goes from this path, this, over to the other side of the barley, right to the river edge, twenty bighās— or this one, ten bighās, whichever is first. This is more fertile. For agriculture, this one...",Prabhupāda," So which one, like you like?"
Guest,"Whichever one is possible. As he says, ""First come, first served.""",Prabhupāda," All right. So you arrange. During stay, arrange something."
Guest; Śyāmasundara,"Something available here also?; This is the old river bed, isn't it?",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Jayapatākā,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda, ...will help us. (Bengali) So you purchase on this side land.
Jayapatākā,This land is for sale with this dhow (?) here. (end),Prabhupāda," He's situated as Paramātmā , antaryāmī , everywhere, aṇḍāntara- stham , within the universe as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu , within the heart of everyone, and even within the atom. Then how we can walk? Kṛṣṇa is within the atom. How we can walk? If somebody says, ""How we are walking on the road?"" Because in the atom there is God. Within... Aṇḍāntara- stha - paramāṇu -cayāntara- stham [Bs. 5.35] ."
Guest (1),In everywhere...,Prabhupāda," So this, this is combination of paramāṇu , atom. So how we can walk? People may question like that, that ""In, within the paramāṇu , there is Kṛṣṇa . How we are walking on this road?"" So this question you should all understand very... You know that upon the mandira , we do not stay. Just like our Vṛndāvana mandira is being constructed. There is no residential quarter upon the mandira . Similarly, when the mandira will be constructed, we are not so fool that we'll show, we'll go and stay upon the mandira . But mandira is not constructed yet. So what shall we do?"
Guest (1),Worship should go on.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore we have temporary situated mandira in the same building. We cannot stop our worship. That is not possible. Because one cannot go upon the mandira , because the Lord is now being worshiped within the residence, it does not mean we can stop His worship. Worship must continue in any condition, apratihatā , without being impeded by any rules and regulations. This is called rāga - mārga . Vidhi - mārga , and there is rāga - mārga . Vidhi - mārga means under rules and regulations, and rāga - mārga means out of love. That is another thing. There is another instance. Govinda was personal servant of Caitanya Mahāprabhu . So after His dinner, Govinda used to give Him massage on the leg. So one day Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell down on the ground and began to sleep on the door. So Govinda was to give massage to His leg. So he crossed Caitanya Mahāprabhu , and began to..."
Guest (1),Walk.,Prabhupāda," No, not walk. Giving massage. So He was sleeping. So at two or three o'clock when Caitanya , Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became awake: ""Govinda, you are sitting here. You have not taken your dinner?"" ""No, sir."" ""Why?"" ""Now, how could I cross you and take my dinner?"" ""Then how you came?"" ""No, that is for Your massaging. (laughter) But I cannot cross You for my dinner."""
Guest (1),"Yes. ""For You I can cross.""",Prabhupāda," For You, I can do anything."
Guest (1),For You...,Prabhupāda, For Your service.
Guest (1),For your service.,Prabhupāda," But for my sense gratification, I cannot do that."
Guest (1),Very good answer.,Prabhupāda," In a, in the Western countries, I had to sometimes do something which I should not have done. But I've done it to bring so many souls to Kṛṣṇa ."
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : The preaching necessitates that.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because if there is no other alternative, what can I do? In the beginning I had no disciples. So I was cooking myself. So one gentleman, he... Later on, he became my disciple. He gave me some place. I was cooking. And in the refrigerator, I saw there was meat. (laughs) So I asked: ""What is this?"" He said, ""It is for cats. I don't take meat."" ""All right. (laughter) I'll do (?)."" So of course, I stayed there for three, four days. And if I cry, ""Oh, I have violated my rules and regulations..."" Rules and regulations can be violated when there is urgent necessity of service, not whimsically or for one's sense gratification. And that is, of course, in our present..., with the permission of the spiritual master, not one should think, ""Oh, I have become so much great devotee, I can violate all the rules and regulations."" No, you cannot. If there is need of violating rules and regulations, you must take permission. Now we have no temple. Under the circumstances, we are doing that. So you construct the temple as soon as possible so that people may not criticize you. [break] ...for all gṛhastha devotees, you should begin preaching amongst the gṛhasthas. It is not forbidden for the gṛhasthas to preach. Because preaching is required everywhere. Arjuna was gṛhastha . So yei kṛṣṇa - tattva - vettā sei guru haya [Cc. Madhya 8.128 ] . One must know the science of Kṛṣṇa . Then you can become preacher."
Guest (1),It is temporary...,Prabhupāda," You have yet to see what is temple. ""Temple will be constructed. This is not temple."" I wanted to stay in the dharmaśālā of Tīrtha Mahārāja , to construct the temple. I requested him that ""Some of my men will stay in the dharmaśālā. "" He refused. Then how can I construct temple? Therefore I have first constructed residential quarters. And unless my men live here, how can I construct temple? So this is residential quarter. This is not the temple. The temple has yet to be done. So suppose we have no regularly constructed temple, do you think we shall give up worship of the Lord?"
Guest (1),No.,Prabhupāda, Then?
Guest (1),We must continue it.,Prabhupāda," That's it. Because there is no temple... Bhavānanda , you are understanding?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Oh yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),We can do our worship anywhere else.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And it is said...
Guest (1),"Anywhere, in the jungle, anywhere else.",Prabhupāda," ... bhakti . Bhakti , the definition of bhakti is given in the Bhāgavata , apratihatā . Pratihata means impediment. I have seen amongst the Mohammedans. It is very good. As soon as their namaz time is there, anywhere they will..."

Guest (1),There was big trouble about them...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guest (1),There was big trouble about them in London for some time.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Guest (1),Because they would leave their work and start praying.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Guest (1); Guest (2),"Then the work was stopped, and later on, it was sorted out. They were allowed to do their worship.; [break] ...cultured under, say, very comfortable circumstances. This has a relation to constant inquiries from public, specially young men, at the entrance of our mandira , our, this building, these days. I was sort of doing, helping them for entrance and exit. In that course, many young people specially they asked, ""How could people living in so much comfortable circumstances could hear and ask for bhakti .""",Prabhupāda, Then does it mean that those who are...?
Guest (2),"I, knew... Yes... Yes...?",Prabhupāda," Those who are in uncomfortable situation, they are big bhaktas? (laughter) Can you show me that because they're in uncomfortable situation, they have become big bhakta ? Is that the proof? What is this land?"
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : This land we were looking at a few days ago? You suggested purchasing it for grazing.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is very nice. So it is possible?
Bhavānanda,Bhavānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Oh, so do it. [break] ...bhakti's, as I explained, apratihatā . Any condition, bhakti can be executed. The example is given: Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya . Rāmānanda Rāya was gṛhastha and governor, and he was very comfortably situated. And Rūpa Gosvāmī was living underneath a tree every night. And both of them were equally... Rather, Rāmānanda Rāya was accepted in greater position than Rūpa Gosvāmī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in renounced order of life, but He gave even better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī. And Rāmānanda Rāya was a gṛhastha . He was not even a brāhmaṇa . And governor, very opulent. Very comfortable situation. You know this?"
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda," So how Caitanya Mahāprabhu treated them equally or gave better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī? This question was raised—not only now—when our Guru Mahārāja started Gauḍīya Maṭha . So he was allowing the sannyāsīs to live in palatial building and go in car for preaching work. So many such persons questioned, ""How is that, sannyāsīs are going in car, living in palatial building?"" So our Guru Mahārāja replied that ""A devotee should be offered the best comfort of life. And if he would not have introduced this comfortable life, at the same time, to become pure devotee, then these devotees from Western countries will, would never come. They would never agree to sit down under the tree and, imitating Rūpa Gosvāmī... That is not possible."" Do you understand or not?"
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, What is your answer?
Guest (2),I answered that...,Prabhupāda," No, no. You answer me. I am talking with you."
Guest (2),"Actually, I didn't know...",Prabhupāda," Now, in our building we have got the most comfortable situation. There is no such sanitary arrangement in any of the temples. But we are trying to give them. Because we deal, dealing in a different atmosphere."
Guest (1),People of the different countries can...,Prabhupāda, Yes. And they are...

Guest (1),And they're born and brought up in this...,Prabhupāda," They have sacrificed so much for me. They are ready to lie down under the tree. But it is my duty to see they are, as far as possible, they're comfortably situated. That is my duty. They can agree to live in any condition."
Guest (2),"Gargamuni said me like this one day, and myself and one of the devotees went to draw the ration from the river in the distance, two miles off. And the devotee's saying, ""We'll go by the car."" And ""Let us go by the rickshaw.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, they do like that."
Guest (2),"I like to save the paths(?) of the temple. And that devotee's not... Up till devotee, but he was a worker, his whole time living in the temple. And I asked Gargamuni, ""Your devotee is saying, 'We'll go by car. It is expensive. Because we are collecting money from the different peoples and from the public. And we must not use our money in this way.' """,Prabhupāda," Jaya . For Kṛṣṇa bhakti , yes."

Those who are coming by cars, and those who are coming gorgeously, and they are donating much to the institutions, they are welcomed by the people, management of these institutions.

Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Caitanya Mahāprabhu , He was ideal sannyāsī , and He was living apart from any material attachment. But we have to do preaching work. We have to construct temple, comfortable temple. So who will pay for that?"

Well, everyone is in a bona fide disciplic succession provided he keeps that tradition, keeps that tradition. Āpani ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā . One must behave that ""I belong to this disciplic succession. I must keep myself fit for the post."" Then it is all right. If he deviates, then he deviates the disciplic succession. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Caitanya Mahāprabhu says frankly that... This is disciplic succession. Āmāra ājñāya : ""Just carry out My order."" Then you are in disciplic succession. If you do not keep yourself in the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu , then simply by becoming disciple, you are not in the disciplic succession. This is disciplic succession. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said this clearly, āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei : ""Wherever you live, you become a spiritual master."" How? Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa - upadeśa : [ Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] ""Whomever you meet, you only speak what Kṛṣṇa has instructed."" Then you are disciplic succession. It doesn't matter what you are and where you are. It doesn't matter. This is disciplic succession. And if you think, ""Now I am initiated. I am now liberated. I have no other business,"" then you are not in the disciplic succession. You must preach. That is disciplic succession."
Guest (1),This is the definition of a disciple.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei deśa [Cc. Madhya 7.128 ] , yāre dekha ... You have to...

It is simply a plea. Everyone know that Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to distribute the Hari - nāma - saṅkīrtana . This is the essence, and let them help, prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā , by life, by money, by words. This is the movement. Why they are anxious to get information more? That is a plea.

Bhavānanda,"Bhavānanda : I say, ""Why you are asking me that? You already know.""",Prabhupāda," Rather, they are to give information. But this is a plea. Bhagavad- gītā is, was not made in London.

Their position is so low-graded now?"
Guest (1),They do not like to learn it. They do not like to know it.,Prabhupāda, That's it. Is Bhagavad- gītā imported from London? Why do they ask like this? How much degraded they have become.
Guest (1),And our answers must be like this.,Prabhupāda," Yes. As if you are... They are importing knowledge from Lenin, these rascals, and they do not know what is Bhagavad- gītā . How much degraded they have become. Just see."

Passerby,Jayo!,Prabhupāda, Hare Kṛṣṇa .

Bhagavān,Bhagavān : Śūdras...,Prabhupāda," Those who are śūdras, they should not be allowed to take sannyāsa . Only those who are qualified brāhmaṇas, they'll be allowed to take sannyāsa ."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : Kṣatriyas used to take sannyāsa too?,Prabhupāda, Kṣatriyas... Some of them. Not all.
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja ?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurudāsa,Guru dāsa : Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja .,Prabhupāda," They did not take sannyāsa , but they left home. There is no need of accepting sannyāsa . One has to perform the devotional activities. That is real thing. Simply by changing dress, one does not improve. Unless he takes to the, seriously, principles of devotional service. But in the Kali - yuga , they'll think, ""Because I have changed my dress, I have become a big sannyāsī . "" You see? ""Because I have got a sacred thread, now I am a brāhmaṇa . "" No. There must be regular training. Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
Jagadīśa,"Jagadīśa : Śrīla Prabhupāda, in a varṇāśrama society is...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jagadīśa,"Jagadīśa : In a varṇāśrama society, are most of the citizens śūdras?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jagadīśa,Jagadīśa : Are the majority of citizens śūdras? In a varṇāśrama society?,Prabhupāda," Yes. The number of śūdras are always bigger. Just like in University education. The, the number of graduates and post-graduates, they're less. Others are big, number bigger."
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : The whole idea is that at the end of everyone's life, everyone is required to leave home, perform devotional activities, but not necessarily take sannyāsa .",Prabhupāda," Devotional activities, either he leaves from home or not leaves, that doesn't matter. It must continue from the very beginning. For the management of affairs, we require to divide. Because there are different classes of brain, so those who have very intellectual brain, they should become brāhmaṇas. Those who are fit for management and protection, they should be trained as kṣatriya . And those who are fit for producing food, taking care of the cows, they should be trained as vaiśya . And the balance, they're all śūdras. This is the division. You... Everywhere you'll find this division, natural. One class of men, very intelligent. One class of men, very strong, good brain for management, administration. (aside) Jaya . One class of men, fit for tilling the ground, field, and produce food, take care of the cows. And the balance, śūdra . That's all. So in our society, this division should be there. The most intelligent class of men, they should be engaged in preaching, reading books and instructing, taking care of Deity worship, temple, and another class should be strong managers, that things are going on nicely. Everyone is engaged, not that eating and sleeping. Everyone must be engaged, employed. So, so if one is very much adapted for eating and sleeping, he should be engaged with plows. You see. He must be activity. Otherwise, there must be dysentery, eating and sleeping. He cannot digest. Yes. So in this way, our society should be managed. Not that ""Give me second initiation, a sacred thread."" And after getting it, business finished: ""Now I'm liberated. Let me eat and sleep."" This should be stopped. We have got fifty bighās of land, and I have calculated in Māyāpura, setting aside twenty bighās for the temple and grazing ground for the cows, thirty bighās of land. The production should be three hundred mounds of grains. And three hundred mounds of grain, I have calculated. How much you can...?"
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : Fifteen hundred.,Prabhupāda," No. According to our present calculated, about 180 mounds. So there should be 120 mounds excess of grain. Instead of excess, they want ten thousand rupees for maintenance. This is... This management is going on. These things were not discussed in GBC? So what kind of discussion was there? Simply talking? No practical? And the estimate of budget was presented for ten thousand rupees per month. And... And when it was scrutinizingly studied, immediately it came down to six thousand. So what kind of budget? So management should be in that way, that nobody is sitting idly. Automatically he'll fall sick. Sickness means idleness. Or excess eating, sleeping. No excess, no less. Yuktāhāra- vihārasya yogo bhavati duḥkha - hā . Yukta . Yukta means actually what you need. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa . So everywhere, in each center, this system should be introduced, and there must be practical application of the varṇāśrama . At the same time, this program of devotional service. Then it will go on very nicely."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Should devotees be formally designated in a particular occupation?,Prabhupāda," Eh? No. Devotees are devotees. Actually devotees are above this brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya , vaiśya , śūdra . But for management of material things, we have to divide. Just like in the body there are divisions. There are... Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa was acting as a kṣatriya . In His boyhood, He was acting like a vaiśya . But Kṛṣṇa is neither kṣatriya nor, nor brāhmaṇa . This is the example. He was a cowherd boy. That is business of vaiśya . And when He was fighting in the battlefield, He was a kṣatriya . He was marrying as a kṣatriya . So although He was acting sometimes as kṣatriya , sometimes as vaiśya , but He's neither of these. So devotee is like that. He may act in any position, but He is above all the material conception of life. That is perfection. Hare Kṛṣṇa , Hare Kṛṣṇa ..."
Nitāi,Nitāi : Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Nitāi,Nitāi : What should the kṣatriyas be taught?,Prabhupāda," Kṣatriyas should be taught that he is manager. He must see that everyone is engaged. And if there is any fight, they must come forward to fight. This is kṣatriya's business. There may be fight. Somebody may attack us. Not that chanting, ""Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa ..."" No. They must come forward. ""Yes, we are prepared to fight."" That is kṣatriya ."
Tamāla-Kṛṣṇa,Tamāla - Kṛṣṇa : Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Eh.
Tamāla-Kṛṣṇa,"Tamāla - Kṛṣṇa : In our centers we are awarding brāhmaṇa initiation, second initiation...",Prabhupāda," No, no. Initiation should go on. Even... You do not understand what I have said, that that is for Vaiṣṇava . A Vaiṣṇava and Viṣṇu ... Just like Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu , He's not human being, but He was acting like human being, similarly, Vaiṣṇava is transcendental. But for proper management of the material world, one should be acting like brāhmaṇa , one should be acting like kṣatriya . That is required. Just like actually we are doing so. Some of you are preaching, and some of you are cleansing the temple. It does not mean that a sannyāsī who is preaching, he is better than that man who is cleansing. The... Their position as Vaiṣṇava is the same. But for the management, one is cleansing, one is seeing the construction, one is going to preach, like that. That should be there. It is not that ""Because I have taken sannyāsa , therefore I cannot any more do anything."" If need be, he has to act as kṣatriya . Or a śūdra . It doesn't matter."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Oh.,Prabhupāda," Doesn't matter. But manage, for management, this division must be there. Otherwise it will be mismanagement. Yes. A Vaiṣṇava coming to the position of doing the work of a śūdra does not mean he has become śūdra . He's Vaiṣṇava . Try to understand this point. Just like in the stage. If you want to play something, one must be king, one must be queen, one must be..., but neither of them king or queen. That is stage play. Similarly to manage things in the material world we have to... Guṇa , karma . Karma there must be. Therefore the karma should be done, executed, according to quality."
Ātreya-ṛṣi,"Ātreya- ṛṣi : So in our Movement, the leaders must decide how every devotee and every resource is engaged properly.",Prabhupāda, That is leadership. That is leadership. The... Which man is fitted for which work.
Ātreya-ṛṣi,Ātreya- ṛṣi : Yes. Utilization of all resources...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya-ṛṣi,Ātreya- ṛṣi : ...including devotees and funds and everything.,Prabhupāda," Then... The first thing is that we should see that everyone is engaged. How he should be engaged, that requires leadership. But the first business is to engage everyone. Nobody should be without engagement. Then it will be idle worse, works... What do you call? Idle brain is devil's workshop. And the devil is kāminī- kāñcana , woman and money. This is devil. So if you remain idle, then you shall think of devil. So we should see that everyone is engaged properly. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . [break] ...instruction in this connection is very important. Everyone should be trained as Vaiṣṇava . At the same time, he should work in different position for management. So if our men are not prepared— Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja —for doing the plowing work, then what is the use of purchasing land?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are not prepared.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Tamāla Kṛṣṇa : They are not prepared.,Prabhupāda," Then? You have to engage laborer and spend two hundred rupees per head at least, including salary and food, and the production is nil. In this way, there must be ten thousand, twenty thousand expenditure. Am I right or not, that ""You bring money some way from anywhere, and let us spend lavishly?"" What kind of management this is? We should consider the money, after all, is earned with hard labor. So somebody will bring money with hard labor, and another body will spend like irresponsible prince; that should be stopped. That is management. [break] ...especially is that the religion means to make a class of men, simply idle... What is? Opiate...? What is called?"
Devotees,Opiate of the people.,Prabhupāda," Therefore they are against religion. But actually, if we show that we are producing, we are managing, we are educating, then we can counteract the communist tendency. But they are seeing that, that escaping. They say, ""They escape responsibility of worldly life and they're indulging in some religious..."" That is the tendency. All... Everywhere the government is complaining like that. Therefore they do not want to increase the number of temples, increase the number of devotees. They do not want. Because they say, ""These are a class of idle men. They cannot do anything, and they take to this religious life."" That is the tendency. They are feeling like that. But if you show that you are actually doing something ideal, then they will appreciate. Make a small unit of community and show ideal life, not idle life. Ideal life. Then this mis... That... Now in Bombay, they have refused. Because they are under the impression that ""They, these Europeans have come here under some sentiment, and what is the use?"" They have taken some plea and rejected our... [break] ...is there. As we are making counterpropaganda against māyā , the māyā is also very strong. She will also make propaganda against you, very strong. So unless you become very sincere devotee, daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. 7.14 ] , then it will not be possible to conquer over māyā . You'll be succumbed. Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] ... taranti te , mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te . In India the, the brāhmaṇa class, they say, ""Oh, I am born in brāhmaṇa family. Why shall I do this work?"" You see. Therefore the whole society has gone to hell. In your country still, they accept any kind of work. It doesn't matter. And here, in India, if he happens to be a brāhmaṇa , he'll not take any kind of work. Means... Just like plowing. He'll not agree. Therefore so much land. The kṣatriya is thinking, ""I am kṣatriya . "" The brāhmaṇa is thinking, ""I am brāhmaṇa . "" And the land is lying fallow. There is no production. He will go to the office and fight with the pen as a kṣatriya . And instead of studying Vedas, he'll study the rules and regulations given by the office. But he'll not come to plow. Therefore this scarcity of food. He'll go to a mill to work as ordinary laborer. (Hindi) He'll not come. So much land we see lying unutilized. And they're crying for grain. Why? The same example. I was writing that in New York City, the whole city is full of dirty things, garbage, for want of cleaners, and you go to the Central Park, you'll find so many hippies are lying down idle."
Ātreya-ṛṣi,Ātreya- ṛṣi : Unemployment.,Prabhupāda, Not employment. They'll not work. That means mismanagement. Why they should remain down? Why they should remain without any employment? But the government is not doing that.
Devotee,They do not feel inspired.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee,They do not feel inspired. No one has desire.,Prabhupāda," That, that means mismanagement. You had no desire to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but you have been taken to it by some, some way or other. That is management."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Jaya , Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, That is management.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : You are expert manager.,Prabhupāda," A child does not want to go to school, but it is the duty of the parent to send him to the school by some way or other. So that is government's duty, that a man should be employed according to his capacity. There should be no unemployment. That is very dangerous position of the society. Now this unemployment question is very strong all over the world. They'll plan that ""This government is not good. That system is not good. He's not good."" And he'll do nothing. He'll personally do nothing. Just like the hippies, they criticize everyone, but he'll not do anything. It is all... These descriptions are there in the Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . We are going too far? Employed... [break] ...from the government to utilize this land. You see? So much. Everywhere you'll find. Everywhere you'll find. Who was with me in London?"
Devotee,"Yeah. Last time, last summer?",Prabhupāda, Letchmore Heath.
Devotee,Yeah?,Prabhupāda," So much, lying vacant. They have taken it into consideration that ""What is the use of working in the land? Better kill one animal and eat easily."" Because he doesn't care for sinful activities. The... ""If I can eat the cow, why shall I take so much trouble to till the...?"" This is going on, all over the world."
Indian man,Employment means now just to cut the money and not to work. No work.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] The same... Employment, even for the woman, the carakā . You see? Gandhi also studied this. There must be... Woman should be engaged for weaving. What is called?"
Devotee,Spinning.,Prabhupāda," Spinning, yes. Everyone should be engaged. That is management. So all GBC members must see that in every temple, everyone is engaged."
Brahmānanda,Brahmānanda : That is the meaning of leadership.,Prabhupāda, That is the meaning of leadership.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : And that all the devotees are protected.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : And all the devotees are protected.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everyone should be engaged. And if everyone is engaged, he'll never fall sick. Yes. [break] ...the farmers, their son, they're giving up the farming business."
Haṁsadūta,Going to the city.,Prabhupāda, Going to the city. In your country also?
Ātreya-ṛṣi,"Ātreya- ṛṣi : Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Or you have nothing to do with farming.
Ātreya-ṛṣi,Ātreya- ṛṣi : Excuse me?,Prabhupāda," Your country, there is nothing to do with farming. You have got petrol."
Ātreya-ṛṣi; Devotee,"Ātreya- ṛṣi : No. No there is a lot of good land, but they're not developing it.; Just selling petrol.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes, if they can get money underground, ""Why shall I work?"" (end)"
Devotee,Yeah.,Prabhupāda," No? They want. There is regular business. In India also. In the hotels there are regular business to pick up college girls and enjoyed by the guests. So many things are going on on this basis of sinful activity. All over the world. So they become polluted, all people..., population, then how they can expect good government? Some of them will take the charge of the government, and he's polluted. (pause) Indigestion. You know that? Indigestion."
Devotee,Ha .,Prabhupāda," You have not digested your food. [break] Any carpenter working in... [break] The government was pleased to reply that they're maintaining themselves by selling literature. Similarly, if it comes to the notice of the government that they're maintaining ourselves by production of food, they'll like very much. [break] In your temple."
Devotee,Feeding.,Prabhupāda, (chuckles) [break]
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : ...the society would go to the gurukula , and there it would be decided what their work would be?",Prabhupāda," Yes. First of all there should be an instructor on the spiritual life, then according to his position... Our spiritual life is meant, we should always remember... But for management we have to make divisions. That is..."
Devotee,Actually the whole society could be Vaiṣṇava .,Prabhupāda," Ah. They're Vaiṣṇava . But because they have got to live in the material world, there must be division of work. If everyone wants to become the brain, who will act as leg? That is also required. If everyone says, ""No, no, I'm not going to do the work of leg. I want simply to work as..."" No. It is needed. The brain is needed, the hand is needed, the belly is needed, the leg is needed. So that we have to divide. Who will work as brain, who will work as hand, who will work as leg... The main aim is how to maintain this body perfectly, fit. That should be the aim, how the society will go on nicely. And for management, this hand, leg, brain, belly must be divided. Just like there's slight difference, those who are directly engaged in temple worship and those who are going to sell books. Apparently there's difference, but basically there is no difference. Like that. If one can sell books nicely, why he should be, I mean to say, engaged in the temple worship? He can do better work in that way. But there is no difference between selling the books and temple worship. Or washing the dish. There's no difference, because it is all transcendental. Just like aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti. Kṛṣṇa's hands and legs, there's no difference. You've read this verse?"
Haṁsadūta,"Yes, aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya...",Prabhupāda, But still leg and hand.
Madhudviṣa,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Hm.
Madhudviṣa,"Kṛṣṇa says, Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyam [Bg 18.68 ] .",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Madhudviṣa,"He says, ""Those who repeat this message of Bhagavad- gītā , are most dear friends to me, and there's no one more dear to Me than he...""",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Madhudviṣa,Wouldn't that indicate that a preacher is higher than a worker?,Prabhupāda," Yes, this is preaching, this is preaching. You help. Suppose you are preaching, and if I help you... Just like I'm preaching, you're helping. You are also preaching."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Also this building is preaching.,Prabhupāda, This is also preaching. So it is not that preaching means simply talking. Preaching means everything. The construction is also preaching. The designing is also preaching. Everything is... Otherwise what is the use of spending so much money if it is not preaching?
Devotee; Haṁsadūta,Jaya .; Yeah. [break] Everything that has to do with propagating Kṛṣṇa ...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,...in any way.,Prabhupāda, That is preaching. Just like... Nava - vidhā - bhakti .
Haṁsadūta,That's important...,Prabhupāda," That is important. Otherwise every work is preaching. See that everyone is engaged. There was an advertisement by the railroad department, their monogram was a wheel of carriage and they have written that every employee of the railroad should see that the wheel is running on. Wheel is running on. Now suppose in the office the clerks are working, so how they will see the wheel is running on? Because in the office of railway there is some complaint, there is some claim, there so many things... But that is depending on their wheel. So they should expedite their business so that wheel may not stop, it must go on. It is very nice instruction. So the wheel is going on. Suppose some station has asked for ten wagons immediately, and that requires the sanction of the divisional superintendent. That is his office. So the clerk should help the progress that immediately the sanction is done. Then the wheel will go on. Do you understand? So everyone can help that the railway wheel is going on. Although apparently it will appear that ""What this clerk has to do with the wheel going on?"" Is it clear?"
Bhagavān,"Bhagavān : So there's so much to do in Kṛṣṇa's service, everyone can be engaged in some...",Prabhupāda," Yes, that everyone should know... Suppose one is engaged in cooking prasādam . You should see that nice prasādam is served to the worker, quickly, so they can take prasādam , be healthy and go on preaching. So he is helping preaching by cooking. Just like you are working and the brain is also working, ""Go this side, go that side, the car is coming."" Brain says, the... ""Leg, come this side."" Everyone is working. The leg is working, the brain is working, the hand is working, the tongue is working. But the business of the tongue and business of the leg is different. The aim being, the central point being Kṛṣṇa , to help, to serve Him, then everything is work, absolute. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot understand it. They think that ""Kṛṣṇa is working like ordinary man. How He can become God? It is māyā . Therefore Kṛṣṇa is also māyā . "" Therefore we called them Māyāvādī ."
Bhagavān,Bhagavān : A leader must be very expert so that people would be happy in their engagement.,Prabhupāda," Everyone should be expert. The leaders must be expert and the worker must be expert so that they may follow the instruction of the leader. If the leader says something and the workers, ""Hm, I shall consider it, later on,"" then how the leader will execute his leadership? Both of them should be cooperating and know that ""We are all working for Kṛṣṇa ."" Somebody was coming back and going... Coming this side or... Our men? No."
Devotees; Ātreya Ṛṣi,No. [break]; ...woman.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Ātreya Ṛṣi,"There are so many... So few compared to other religions, but we make so big propaganda always...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Because...,Prabhupāda," It is admitted, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement it is admitted."
Ātreya Ṛṣi,Because we are not lazy like Māyāvādīs.,Prabhupāda," Yeah. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi. ""I have become now Brahman —stop work. Eat and make your belly..."" You see how Māyāvādī sannyāsī ... Ah. (Prabhupāda gestures; devotees laugh) They think that ""Now I have become Brahman , I have nothing to do. (Prabhupāda laughs) I have become Nārāyaṇa ."" ""If you've got nothing to do, then why you are eating?"" And for one cāpāṭi you'll find there are many Māyāvādīs. They're busy simply collecting cāpāṭis. (devotees laugh) So what is time of your starting?"
Pañcadraviḍa,We're starting at nine.,Prabhupāda, Nine.
Pañcadraviḍa,Prasādam is being served at eight.,Prabhupāda, Oh. This Christian land is not available?
Devotee,There's no reliable information on it.,Prabhupāda, You can get from that gentleman... (end)
Satsvarūpa,For the public in general?,Prabhupāda," Eh? Yes. Anyone. Just like engineering college is open for anyone. He must be ready to take up the training. Similarly, this varṇāśrama college, he must be ready, the student, must be ready to take up the training."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Would it be for a particular age group?,Prabhupāda," Yes, any education, from childhood. Yes. Education means from childhood. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha [SB 7.6.1 ] . The... How... We are getting so many sannyāsīs, they should teach. Teaching should be done by the sannyāsīs. Just like in missionary school, the fathers teaches."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : How would it be different than gurukula?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : How would it differ from gurukula?,Prabhupāda," Gurukula is only for the small children. Preliminary, primary. And when the children are grown up, they should be sent to the varṇāśrama school or college for further developed training."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : They should... Should they be taught also some... Should there also be teaching in some particular skill or varṇa ? Such as say...,Prabhupāda, No.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Say, for example, someone was a, a kṣatriya by inclination, or a...?",Prabhupāda," No, inclination can be changed also. If one has got little ad... But we should take little advantage of the inclination. Not that... That is to be decided by the... Inclination or no inclination, we can... That will be done. That is not very difficult. This is a most important item. Because people have been spoiled all over the world by being misguided by the so-called leaders. Therefore varṇāśrama college is required. Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : But Prabhupāda, I'm still not quite clear. In other words, we'd teach, for example, like Bhagavad- gītā and Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam .",Prabhupāda, Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa . Jaya . Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : How much would be expected of the students as far as...? Would they live with us and follow the four principles? Like that? Or just come for classes or...?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Come to classes you won't get. Because nobody has got any taste for such thing. A boarding school or boarding college would...
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Boarding school.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : And there should... Should there be any material subject matters taught like in gurukula?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like material subject matter, kṣatriya , or the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriya , as they are described in the Bhagavad- gītā , what are the symptoms of brāhmaṇa , what is the symptoms of kṣatriya . The kṣatriyas should be taught how to fight also. There will be military training. There will be training how to kill."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Oh.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And vaiśyas should be trained how to give protection to the cows, how to till the field and grow food. Practical."
Nitāi,Nitāi : Not business also?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Nitāi,Nitāi : The vaiśyas?,Prabhupāda," Business, this rascal business, no."
Nitāi,Nitāi : No?,Prabhupāda," Business means if you have got extra grains or extra foodstuff, you can sell where there is necessity, there is want. That is business. We are not going to open mills and factories and... No. We are not going to do that. That is śūdra business. The real business is that you produce enough food grains, as much as possible, and you eat and distribute. That's all. This is business. He does not require any so high technical education. Anyone can till the ground and grow food. Is it difficult? This is the business. The first thing is that everyone, man and animal, especially the cows, they must be properly fed so become very stout and strong. Cows will supply milk, and man will work hard, without being suffered by dysentery. He must work hard. Any capacity. Work as a teacher or work as a kṣatriya , work as a ploughman. Or work as general assistant. He must work. Everyone should be employed. And his employment will be provided from any of these groups, according to his capacity. Either as a brāhmaṇa , or as a kṣatriya , or as a vaiśya , or as a śūdra ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : What kind of training is there for a śūdra ?,Prabhupāda, Śūdra is general assistant.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Oh, just...",Prabhupāda," Order-carrier. He has no intelligence. He doesn't require intelligence. ""Do this."" That's all."
Satsvarūpa,"What would he learn at the school, though?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,What would his business be at that varṇāśrama college?,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is also training, to become obedient. Because people are not obedient. What are these hippies? They are not obedient. So obedience also require training. If you have no intelligence, if you cannot do anything independently, just be obedient to the other, higher three classes. That is śūdra . He must agree to abide by the orders of brāhmaṇa , kṣatriyas, vaiśya . That's all. So that nobody will be unemployed. Everyone should be trained up to sleep six to eight hours and attend meeting, chant, and ārati . And balance—he must work hard. Not that sleeping unlimitedly. There is no limit."
Yaduvara,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaduvara,What class does the arts and crafts come under?,Prabhupāda, Eh? Śūdra.
Yaduvara,Śūdra.,Prabhupāda," They are śūdras. Little arts and crafts can be trained up to the śūdras. They, at the present moment, they have given too much stress on the arts and crafts."
Yaduvara,Hm. Yes.,Prabhupāda," Therefore the whole people, population, is śūdra ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : It is a fact.,Prabhupāda," That is a... That is the difficulty. All people are being drawn by giving them, I mean to say, attraction for high salary, and they are taking so-called technical education, and all of them working in the factory. Nobody's working on the field. They are śūdras. [break]"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : ...artist is accepted as a philosopher in life.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : In our society [break] ...accepted [break] ...as a philosopher.,Prabhupāda, Artist?
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yeah, the artist.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Artist is also business of the śūdra ."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes, but in our... I'm saying, in modern society in America, they are considered... [break]",Prabhupāda, Nonsense philosophy. They do not know what is the meaning of philosophy.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," That, in your western countries the rascals, they are writing philosophy on sex life, which is known by the dog."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda, And he is writing so many things. So they are rascals. [break] ...human being. You see. What is this philosophy? Sex life? Even dog knows how to have sex life. And he's writing philosophy. So this kind of philosophy can be appreciated by the rascals and... [break] We do not appreciate that. They are not philosopher. Philosopher means who is searching out the Absolute Truth. That is philosophy.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Jaya .,Prabhupāda," That is philosophy. Darśana . Darśana means search out what is the ultimate. Jñānī ca bharatarṣabha [ Bg. 7.16 ] . Catur - vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna, ārto 'rthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha , arto 'rthārthī jijñāsur jñānī ca bharatarṣabha . These are philosophers. Even the ārtaḥ , even a distressed person, he is praying to the Supreme Authority, ""My God, I am very much hungry. Kindly give me my daily bread."" He's also philosopher, because he's searching out the Absolute Truth. He's philosopher. Not this Freud rascal, elaborating how to have sex life. So this kind of philosopher, they... What is called? In Bengali: vane haye śṛgāla rājā . (?) ""In the jungle a jackal becomes a king."" So because western people, they have no... They're all less than śūdras. So a Freud has become a philosopher. Vane haye śṛgāla rājā . ""In the jungle, the jackal has become a king."" That's all. What is knowledge there? It is that... The whole western world is going on for industry, for making money, eat, drink, be merry, wine and women. That's... They're all less than śūdras and caṇḍālas. This is the first time attempt is being made to make them human beings. Don't mind. I am using very strong words. That is the fact."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : It's true. Yes.,Prabhupāda," Otherwise, they are little animals with four hand, two legs, two hand, hand animals. That's all. Yes. Rejected them. Vedic civilization rejected them, mlecchas and yavanas. But they can be reformed. The process is the same. Not that because they are rejected, they cannot be reclaimed. They can be reclaimed also. Just like you are being done. Although you are coming from the mlecchas and yavanas, by training, you are becoming more than a brāhmaṇa . So there is no bar for them. Unfortunately, these rascals do not agree to accept. As soon as you say, ""No more illicit sex,"" oh, they become angry. As soon as I say, ""There is no meat-eating,"" they become angry. Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śamayati (?). The rascals, fools, if you give them good lessons, education, they will be angry. Prakopayati na śamayati. Payaḥ pānaṁ bhujaṅgānām (?). The snake, if you give him nice milk and banana, the result will be he will increase his poison. Payaḥ pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa - vardhanam . But Kṛṣṇa's grace, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's grace, they are being now trained up. Now you be trained up and revise the whole edition of the western civilization, especially in America. Then a new chapter will come in. This is the program. Therefore varṇāśrama school required."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So Prabhupāda, in this varṇāśrama college, is it true that there will be no need, for example, for teaching material history and mathematics and...?",Prabhupāda," No, there is no need. History, we simply read Mahābhārata, history of the great men, Pāṇḍavas, how they were fighting for the good cause, how they were reigning. That history. Not this rascal history. If you study that history millions of years, what is that history and what you'll learn from that history? You learn history of the really great men, how they worked, how they ruled. That is a... You study history of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Mahābhārata.,Prabhupāda," Study the history of Mahārāja Parīkṣit . That is required. Not that simply chronological record, all nonsense, and big, big books, and making research. Why should you waste your time in that way?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Jaya . Yes. And so...,Prabhupāda, Hm? History must be for great person. This is history.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So in our varṇāśrama college the students that come to our college, they follow the four principles... They follow...",Prabhupāda," Four principles essential. Essential. But only the śūdras or the kṣatriyas... Just like kṣatriyas, they have to learn how to kill. So practically, they should go to the forest and kill some animal. And if he likes, he can eat also. If he likes, he can eat also."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : What he kills.,Prabhupāda," Yes. But not from the slaughterhouse. Those who are kṣatriyas, they can, they're allowed sometimes to eat meat. It is understood Bhīma , Bhīma also eating sometimes meat. Bhīma . Amongst the Pāṇḍavas, only Bhīma . Not others. So if the kṣatriyas, they want to eat meat, they can be allowed on particular occasions. But they must go to the forest and kill the animal. Not that for meat-eating regular slaughterhouses should be maintained. This is all nonsense, degradation. If you want to eat meat, you go to the forest. And the śūdras, they also sometimes eat meat. Or the caṇḍālas."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : But never the cow.,Prabhupāda," No. Cow... The śūdras, they can take a goat and sacrifice before the deity, goddess Kālī , and then eat. Nobody should be given unrestricted freedom to eat meat. Or wine. If one is adamant to drink wine, then there is Caṇḍī - pūjā , Durgā - pūjā . That means restriction. That means restriction. Under certain condition. Similarly, sex life—marriage. That is also sex life, but under condition."
Satsvarūpa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, is this school for women also, or just for men?",Prabhupāda," For men. Women should automatically learn how to cook, how to cleanse home."
Satsvarūpa,So they don't attend varṇāśrama college.,Prabhupāda," No, no. Varṇāśrama college especially meant for the brāhmaṇa , kṣatriya and vaiśya . Those who are not fit for education, they are śūdras. That's all. Or those who are reluctant to take education - śūdra means. That's all. They should assist the higher class."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Would the brāhmaṇas learn Sanskrit?,Prabhupāda, Eh? Not necessarily.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Not necessarily. Just more philosophy.,Prabhupāda," Just like I am translating all the books, similarly, any book of knowledge can be translated into different languages. Not that one has to learn Sanskrit. Why?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Not necessary. So in this varṇāśrama college there would be two divisions, varṇa and āśr... Learning a materia...",Prabhupāda," First of all varṇa . And āśrama , then, when the varṇa is perfectly in order, then āśrama . Āśrama is specially meant for spiritual advancement, and varṇa is general division. It must be there in the human society, or they're on the animals. If varṇa is not there, then this is a society of animal. And when the varṇa is working perfectly, then we give them āśrama . Varṇāśrama . That is later on."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : First they should be taught a skill.,Prabhupāda," Yes. First of all, the whole society must be divided into four varṇas. Otherwise, there will be chaotic condition. That is what is the position now. What is he, what he has to do, one does not know. And there are so many unemployment. But if you organize the society into varṇas, there will be no question of unemployment."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : But from the very beginning there should be taught Bhagavad- gītā and...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : From the very beginning we should teach Bhagavad- gītā ?,Prabhupāda," Yes. But our, our position is that we are above varṇāśrama . But for management or ideal society, we are introducing this. We, so far we are concerned, Kṛṣṇa conscious men, we are above varṇāśrama . But to show the people that we are not escaping, we can take part in any order of life. That is our position. Just like if I brush somebody's shoes, that does not mean I am shoemaker. My position is the same. But to show how to do it... Just like a servant is doing. The master is, ""Oh, you cannot do. Just see."" Just like I show you sometimes how to mop. So I am not a mopper, but I am showing how to mop. So our position is like that. We do not belong to any varṇa and āśrama . But we have to show these rascals. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja . He, he was perfect Vaiṣṇava , but when he was king, he was fighting like anything. Not that, ""Oh, I am now become Vaiṣṇava . I cannot kill."" What is this? He killed like anything. When the Yakṣas attacked his kingdom, he was killing like anything then the Yakṣa - rāja came and asked him to pardon this. He immediately accepted. So he wanted to give him some benediction, that ""You are so great that simply on my request, you have stopped killing these rascals, Yakṣas. So you can take some benediction from me."" He said, ""That's all right. Thank you. You give me the benediction that I may be a pure lover of Kṛṣṇa . That's all."" This benediction he asked. Although he was so powerful and, the Yakṣa - rāja , he could give him the wealth of the whole universe. But he made that, ""Thank you very much. You give me this benediction that I may remain a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa ."" This is Vaiṣṇava . He is doing everything, but his aim is to please Kṛṣṇa . Similarly, even if we take to varṇāśrama , we do not belong to any... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, mayā sṛṣṭam . ""I have inaugurated."" But Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do with varṇāśrama . Similarly, if we act as varṇāśrama , still, we have nothing to do with the varṇāśrama ."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda, can you say something about the training for a brāhmaṇa .",Prabhupāda," Yes. They are satyaṁ śamaḥ damaḥ . He must be truthful, he must control the senses, control the mind... śamo damaḥ ,... He must be tolerant. He should not be agitated in trifle matters. Satyaṁ śamo damaḥ śaucam . He must be always clean. Three times he must take bath at least. All the clothing, all, everything is clean. This is brahminical training. And then he must know all what is what, knowledge, and practical application, and firm faith in Kṛṣṇa . This is brāhmaṇa ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So what kind of practical work could we engage them in?,Prabhupāda, They'll be teaching. They'll be all teachers.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Oh, they'll be teachers.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like Droṇācārya. He was brāhmaṇa , but he was teaching military art to the Pāṇḍavas. General teacher class will be the brāhmaṇas. It doesn't matter what he's teaching. But teaching, perfectly teaching, how to become a military man. Arjuna's fighting was due to Droṇācārya. He learned it from Droṇācārya. He was a brāhmaṇa . But because he took the position of a teacher, he thought very perfectly. A brāhmaṇa should be expert in every kind of knowledge. If requires, he'll become teacher. This is brāhmaṇa ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So brāhmaṇa can teach how to fight?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Brāhmaṇa means intelligent, brain. So in intelligent brain one can learn anything and teach anything."
Satsvarūpa,This is all very new.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,This is very new. It seems there'll be many difficulties. So we should try to start this school.,Prabhupāda," What is the difficulty? If I teach you how to cook, is it very difficult?"
Satsvarūpa,"Yes, we have to... No, we have to learn, though.",Prabhupāda," Then similarly, like that. Like that. I am doing that. I am teaching how to mop the floor."
Satsvarūpa,Then it becomes easy.,Prabhupāda, But I must know everything because I am a teacher.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So, for example, if I become a teacher at varṇāśrama , say, the first teacher at the varṇāśrama college, then I have to also become expert at how to fight, how to...",Prabhupāda," Not all of you, but some of you must be, must learn the art of fighting also. But in a practical you are not going to fight. If required, you can fight. I say that we are above all these varṇāśrama , but we must train others or ourself also for material activities, everything, under these divisions."
Viṣṇujana,"For example, in New Vrindaban we have brāhmaṇas that are very expert at tilling the soil and taking care of cows.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣṇujana,And they could travel around and teach others how to do that as well.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That's right. He is brāhmaṇa , but he's teaching how to take care of the cows and ploughing."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : It's not that one teacher has to teach everything.,Prabhupāda," No, no."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Oh, I see. So a brāhmaṇa teacher should become expert in a particular subject and then teach that.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Oh. It's very exciting, Prabhupāda, because all the, at the present time in the...",Prabhupāda," No, the thing is that actually, at the present moment, they are śūdras or less than śūdras. They are not human beings. The whole population of the world. It doesn't matter whether it is western or eastern. That is the position. So unless they are trained up, so the society's already in chaos, and it will go on still more in chaos, chaos. It will be hell. How people will live? And these rascals are being elected as government men, and they're only making budget how to tax. So one side, there is no rain; one side, there is no rice, especially in India; and one side, heavy tax. So they'll be all confused. They have already become confused. So in the confusion state it will be very difficult to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. Therefore preliminary help should be given."
Viṣṇujana,Preliminary.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That they should not be in chaos and confusion. Otherwise, how the brain will work?"
Viṣṇujana,Yes. No one can give rapt attention without peace of mind.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Our main aim is how to give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But if they are already disturbed in every respect, then how they'll take it? Therefore we are taking these subjects, to help him to come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And this is the method - varṇāśrama ."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So just to clarify, Prabhupāda, I want to make sure I have it very clear, that if someone comes to our varṇāśrama college, even though this may be preliminary help, in general—you've made some exceptions—but in general, when they come to our college, they have to follow the four regulative principles, also learn something about Bhagavad- gītā and then, side by side, they learn a...",Prabhupāda, Four regulative principles compulsory.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes.,Prabhupāda," But if some of the kṣatriya or the śūdras, they want, so that is our prescription: ""Go to the forest and kill some animal and eat that."" That's all. You can kill one boar. Some disturbing elements, you can kill. You can kill some tiger. Like that. Learn to kill. No nonviolence. Learn to kill. Here also, as soon as you'll find, the kṣatriya , a thief, a rogue, unwanted element in the society, kill him. That's all. Finish. Kill him. Bās. Finished. So other will see, ""Oh, the ruler is very strong."" And others will... One killing will be lesson for many hundreds and thousands. No mercy. ""Kill him."" That's all. That was the system. In Kashmir about hundred years ago. If somebody has stolen, cut his hand. Bās. He cannot steal any more. So one cutting hand means finish. In that part of the world, no more stealing."
Yaduvara,How would the kṣatriyas kill the animals?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaduvara,How would they kill? With guns or bow and arrow?,Prabhupāda," That, as it is suitable. It is not that because the kṣatriyas were killing by bows and arrows formerly, you have to continue that. That is another foolishness. If you have got... If you can kill easily by guns, take that gun. Just like formerly, parivrāja, Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked on the street. There was no aeroplane or... Or he did not use it. Does it mean that I shall have to follow that? I must take the jet engine. If it is available. If somebody criticizes, ""Oh, Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked on leg and you are travelling in the jet plane?"" Shall I have to take that ideal? These are rascaldom. When you have to work, you have to work with the greatest facility. That's all. Now I have got the facility of the talking in microphone, and... So why should I not take it? It will be recorded. It will be heard by so many others. I am speaking to four, five men. It can be heard by a big crowd of four hundred men."
Viṣṇujana,So we should perpetuate this technical skill of...,Prabhupāda," No. We are not going to... But if somebody's interested doing, so we take it, make the best use of it."
Viṣṇujana,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda," Just like we do not want money. But they are having money by so many ways. So we take their money and construct a temple. We can sit down here and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa . We don't require that temple. But these rascals are accumulating money for wine and women. Take their money, some way or other, and builds a temple. And invite them, ""Come and see."" Give them prasādam . This is our policy. We are not constructing big, big buildings and temples for our convenience. For their convenience. This is sannyāsī ."
Viṣṇujana,"So there should always be programs in the temples for their welfare, not...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣṇujana,...that we live there and...,Prabhupāda," No. But we are taking it, ""Now we have got very nice house, room. Let us sleep and eat."""
Viṣṇujana,Then there'll be wide criticism.,Prabhupāda, That is... This is not good.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda...,Prabhupāda," You should remain always sannyāsī within. Outwardly, for others' convenience, you may do something. Similarly, we are accepting this varṇāśrama . We are not varṇāśrama ; we are above varṇāśrama . But to give others facility to come to the stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this program must be done."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Prabhupāda, generally in colleges in the West, they charge some fee for going to the college. What is our position?",Prabhupāda," No, we don't charge any fee. There is no question of money. Because the brāhmaṇas, they'll teach free. They require money because they have to give fat salary to these rascals. But we haven't got to. And even we have to feed them, we produce our own grain. So where is the question of taking money? So therefore it is required, somebody must produce food. Then there is no necessity of money."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : The vaiśya students will produce the food.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Satsvarūpa,"Should our children who are at gurukula, when they grow up, should they go to that varṇāśrama college, or...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. They should go."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : We'll start it right away.,Prabhupāda, Varṇāśrama college means for grown-up students. College means for grown-up students.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Is there a minimum age for beginning such a college?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Ten to twelve years.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : They can start at ten to twelve?,Prabhupāda," Yes. From five to ten years, gurukula. And after ten years, they should go to the varṇāśrama college."
Viṣṇujana,New Vrindaban would be an ideal place in America for such a school.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Organize that.
Viṣṇujana,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes. I shall go.
Viṣṇujana,This Mahārāja is also going to New Vrindaban.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Viṣṇujana,He can...,Prabhupāda," Do that. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja , you, and combined together, do that."
Viṣṇujana,Yes.,Prabhupāda," We have got so many duties to do. Don't waste time, a single moment. And don't eat more and don't sleep more. Then you'll be able to work."
Viṣṇujana,"And this is the most auspicious work for now, is this remedial measure of...?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Viṣṇujana,"This is the most auspicious work for now, is this remedial measure to stop the chaos in the world?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣṇujana,That's most auspicious.,Prabhupāda," Most auspicious. Because if the people are in chaos, how they'll be able to accept the great philosophy? It requires cool brain."
Viṣṇujana,"For example, in my program...",Prabhupāda, Budhaḥ . Budhaḥ . Eh? Yes?
Viṣṇujana,"My program now is I have ten brahmacārīs in buses, and everything and we're distributing books. But if the people are in chaos, how they will be able to accept the knowledge in the books?",Prabhupāda," No, not all of them are in chaos. There are some of them. Some of them. Not that all of them. Hare Kṛṣṇa [break] ...in separate department."
Passer-by,"Rādhe , Rādhe !",Prabhupāda," Hare Kṛṣṇa . Just see. Due to the past training, even an ordinary man, he's chanting, ""Rādhe, Rādhe ."""
Viṣṇujana,"When we had our boat, the boatmen every morning were...",Prabhupāda, This is India.
Viṣṇujana,...worshiping...,Prabhupāda," Because, due to past culture, even the lowest class of men, he's also great philosopher than these rascals in western countries."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So all the other programs should be continued, and this program should be added.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Parivrājakācārya,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Parivrājakācārya,"Would the...? The persons who would take part in such program, they would have to be devotees in the first place. Is that...?",Prabhupāda," Devotees is... I have already explained. We are all devotees. Past condition, we are all devotees. We are not, we do not belong to this varṇāśrama . I have already told you. Suppose I am mopping. So that does not mean I am mopper. But I am teaching how to mop. This is our position."
Parivrājakācārya,"So the students, also, they must all be devotees.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Devotees are... That is our life and soul.
Satsvarūpa,"And the idea is that after they've finished their schooling, they would take part in ISKCON, preaching in some way as vaiśya or...",Prabhupāda," Yes. This preaching is also required, to make the groundwork. Because nobody's taking care. Just like some of the devotees, great devotees, they took the profession of becoming thief. They, in South India, it was done so. They took the profession of becoming thief. So a devotee is a thief? But he took. They took it. Because nobody was paying. So they organized a plundering party. ""Plunder all these big men."" Just like the politicians do. There is history. Yes. So even up to the point to become a thief, devotees took it. Yes. And the gopīs, even up to the point of becoming prostitute—for Kṛṣṇa . So for Kṛṣṇa's sake we have to accept any nonsense type of business. Or on the highest grade. Anything. But for Kṛṣṇa we have to do that."
Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : So, Prabhupāda, in our temples, we have so many devotees. Should the devotees...?",Prabhupāda, They should be engaged.
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Should they be trained in a particular...?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Those who are not able to preach or to do other things, they must go to the plough department, agriculture."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Those who cannot preach.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Those who are less educated, not very much expert in preaching, they must be acting as kṣatriya or vaiśya , or as śūdra ."
Hṛdayānanda; Prabhupāda: ; Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : And sometimes...; Not he's śūdra . Always remember that. But he has to act to fulfill the, fill up the gap. Proxy.; Hṛdayānanda : So we should encourage people, young people, young students to come to our college.",Prabhupāda," They'll automatically come if you are ideal. Because they are being forced to poverty. So when there is a question of poverty, they'll come."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Room and board and training.,Prabhupāda," Yes. This poverty. Why there is poverty? Because they are not producing food. Everyone wants so-called comfortable life. So-called education. Sitting idle in the table and chair, and talking all gossips, nonsense, and sleeping. They have been trained up in this way, śūdra ."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : So they should be trained to rise early and so on.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, if you keep healthy, then you will naturally rise healthy, er rise early in the morning. But if you... Because you have lost all, what is called? Stamina?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Yes. Yes.,Prabhupāda," Therefore sleeping is my only business. Sleeping means for the weak. And for the strong, perspiration. This is the sign. When a man sleeps too much, he's weak in his health. And the strong man will perspire. These are very... Balera ghāma , and the durbalera ghuma. Ghāma and ghuma. Ghuma means sleeping, and ghāma means perspiration. [break] ...principle. And human beings means trained up under principle. That is the difference between animal. The animals, they cannot take up any training. But the human being, this human form of body is meant for taking training. So if they are not properly trained up, they remain animals and the whole society in chaos and confusion. That's all. [break] ...moment, the human society's so degraded that even we are walking, this is also risky. This is also... Gradually, it is becoming. Just like in our New York... That Berkeley? Berkeley? No. Brooklyn. It is difficult to walk due to the Negroes. They immediately: ""Whatever you have got, give me."" There are so many incidents. In such city as New York there is always danger like that. If somebody kills you, nobody will take care of you. The human society has become... And in India still, they are not so degraded. You see. Even at night you can safely walk on the street. But in Europe, America, you cannot with confidence walk alone in the big, big streets. So human being has become so degraded. Less than animals. They can attack you. Just like in the forest any ferocious animal can attack you at any minute. The whole big, big cities have become like that. [break] ...example that they have started that United Nations. What they have done actually? United Nations. Eh?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Nothing.,Prabhupāda, Have they done anything progressive?
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : No.,Prabhupāda," So? Big, big advertising, ""United Nations."" All nations, you... Because all the cats and dogs united. What they can do? If the all the world's cats and dogs meet together to make a formula, will they be able? (laughter) So actually, this is the proof. They're all cats and dogs. What do they know how to unite, how to live in peace. They do not know even. Because they're animal, cats and dogs. This is the proof. Just study this institution. What they have done? Am I right or wrong?"
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Right.,Prabhupāda, Yes. So study this institution.
Viṣṇujana,Thirty years now.,Prabhupāda," Eh? Thirty years they are struggling for United Nations, big, big expenditure, so many humbug, bharam udvahato vimūḍhān , humbug program, and no result. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, ""I am thinking, I am, only for these rascals. They're making humbug program, but there is no action. And for temporary, so-called happiness, without God consciousness. I am simply thinking of them. Otherwise, personally, I have no problem."" This was spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja to Nṛsiṁhadeva. Śoce tato vimukha - cetasa māyā - sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB 7.9.43 ] . [break] ...business has become like Prahlāda Mahārāja . We can chant anywhere. That's all right. Kṛṣṇa will provide everything. We have no business to do. But we have to take them because we are sympathizer, that so many people are being killed by this modern civilization. They had the opportunity to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, but by the set-up of this rascal civilization, they are being killed spiritually. Therefore we have to take it. [break] ...devotee, personally, he has no problem, but he pushes himself in this degraded society to teach them how to live, how to become gentlemen. Therefore... Otherwise, we have no business. But if we don't give them the opportunity, they'll not be able to come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...it will be good for you because Kṛṣṇa will see, ""Oh, here is My devotee. He's doing so much for me."" Your service will be recognized by Kṛṣṇa . Don't think that because you are teaching a śūdra how to work like this, you have become a śūdra . You are not śūdras, any circumstances. Even though you teach to a śūdra how to work like a śūdra . [break] ...stand. Don't misunderstand. Clearly understand what is the purpose. Is there doubt? Or it is clear?"
Satsvarūpa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣṇujana,"One good example in New Vrindaban, they're actually doing that. They're training kṣatriyas, they're training...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes. That was the very beginning..."
Viṣṇujana,...vaiśyas...,Prabhupāda, I started the New Vrindaban scheme on this formula.
Viṣṇujana; Parivrājakācārya,"Kīrtanānanda Swami has carried it out just as you have desired.; So in a sense, New Vrindaban is already...",Prabhupāda, Eh? Yes. The starting is already there.
Viṣṇujana,"They even have a court system now. They started it when I was there last time. They have so many members that sometimes someone may commit some offense or something. They even have a judicial type of system where he comes before a board of members, older members.",Prabhupāda," Yes. All fights should be decided by the board. That's nice. And it will be accepted even by the court. Here, in India, there is such system. A board of five, ten men in the village, if there is some fight between two parties, whatever the board will decide that will be accepted in the court. Pañcāyeta. It is called pañcāyeta system. [break] You join. There will be no scarcity. This will engage people. Some are, some of them will be engaged to produce food. Where is the question of scarcity? There is food, there is milk. Eat and drink and be human beings."

Viṣṇujana; Hṛdayānanda; Satsvarūpa,"...and turn it into a society.; Hṛdayānanda : Ah, that's wonderful.; Many times our devotees get cheated in business dealings by inexperience. So should they learn from...",Prabhupāda, How to cheat others. (laughter)
Satsvarūpa,"No, not how to cheat, but from experienced devotees how to not be cheated?",Prabhupāda, Why should you go to a person who cheats you? (end)

Hṛdayānanda,"Hṛdayānanda : Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," When there will be military march of Kṛṣṇa conscious soldiers. Anyone who does not believe in Kṛṣṇa , ""Blam!"" (laughter) Yes. The same process as the Mohammedans did, with sword and Koran, we'll have to do that. ""Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa or not?"" ""No, sir."" ""Blam!"" Finished. (laughter, Prabhupāda laughs) What do you think, Madhudviṣa Mahārāja ? Is that all right?"
Madhudviṣa,Yes.,Prabhupāda," (laughing) What these communists can do? We can do better than them. We can kill many communists like that. (laughter) Then it will be counteraction of communist movement. And you think like that. ""Why you are sitting idly, no employment? Come on to the field! Take this plow! Take this bull. Go on working. Why you are sitting idly?"" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nobody should be allowed to sit down and sleep. They must find out some employment, either work as brāhmaṇa or as a kṣatriya or as a vaiśya . Why there should be unemployment? The same example. Just like I am, this body is working. The leg is working, hand is working, brain is working, belly is working. Why there should be unemployment? You just stop this unemployment, you will see the whole world is peaceful. There is no complaint. And they'll very happily chant Hare Kṛṣṇa . Hm? Nobody's working in this field. They're all drawn to the cities to work in the factory. Condemned civilization. That communist emblem, what is that?"
Devotees,Hammer and sickle.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is good.
Indian,"Yeah, good.",Prabhupāda, But no hammer. Only this... What is called?
Devotees,Sickle.,Prabhupāda, No hammer. That will be our emblem. Only sickle. Not hammer. The hammer has hammered the whole human civilization. So just make a counter-emblem. The communists will appreciate.
Devotee,Sickle and tilaka .,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee,"A sickle, and then a tilaka .",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is good idea. Guptajī? Come here. (Hindi)"
