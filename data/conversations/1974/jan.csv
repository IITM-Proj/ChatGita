Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...getting worse over these five thousand years, but by a reintroduction, reintroducing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the tide can be turned in age of Kali ?",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. That is the only remedy. That is the only remedy. Anyone who takes to this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra , he'll be cleansed of all sinful activities and then everything will come out nice. And it is practical. It is not story. Just see, all our disciples in Europe, America, they were habituated to so many bad habits, and because they are chanting, they are now cleansed. So it is small-scale. If you propagate it large-scale, everyone will be cleansed. [break] ...disciples who were trained up from very beginning of their life: meat-eating. They are giving meat-eating. Here in your country, small children, they are fed with meat-powder. Intoxication is also a daily affair. How they are giving up all intoxication? [break] Is there arrangement for... Where is Karandhara?"
Karandhara,"Jaya , Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," That placard, poster?"
Karandhara; Prajāpati,Prajāpati and I discussed it yesterday and we're trying to find an artist to do it.; Prajāpati : Nara - nārāyaṇa Prabhu's good wife is expert artist.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Prajāpati; Nara-nārāyaṇa,Prajāpati : And she has... I guess she has agreed to...; Nara - nārāyaṇa : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, she is very nice, good artist. Give her engagement like this."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Maybe you could explain us a little more detail of the...,Prabhupāda," No, with very much detail it will be cumbrous. You... Symbolic representation."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Those three figures in the center?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : One is a devotee, one is a...",Prabhupāda," No, everyone is devotee."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Yes, they are all three devotees.",Prabhupāda, But they're engaged in three departments.
Karandhara,We were thinking for the administrator there could be a judge.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Karandhara,"Could be a judge, a high-court judge.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That means administrator.
Karandhara,Yes. The other one could be the president.,Prabhupāda," Yes, president also administrator. No, one is in the religious order. That is also required. But here we see, persons who are in religious order, they're also addicted to these four sinful, four sinful life. And he's presenting himself as religious."
Karandhara,On the one should we depict meat-eating or animal slaughter?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,Should we depict animal-slaughter or meat-eating?,Prabhupāda, Animal slaughter.
Karandhara,Animal slaughter.,Prabhupāda, That will be still broader.
Karandhara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," The three figures and one is in a suit, one... They all have tilaka , neck beads and bead bag..."
Karandhara,Gurukṛpā Mahārāja .,Prabhupāda, Eh? Here are religious men.
Nara-nārāyaṇa; Prajāpati,Nara - nārāyaṇa : Oh! (laughter) Jaya !; Prajāpati : How will we distinguish between the other two men? They'll both be in suits.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,"Well, the one man, the president, will be behind the presidential podium, presidential seal. In the front. And the other man would be a high-court judge with...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Karandhara,...with black robes on.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Nara-nārāyaṇa,"Nara - nārāyaṇa : With a, two balls.",Prabhupāda," Make nicely this picture. Short-cut, at the same time very convincing. [break] Yes?"
New Devotee,I'm very new to this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement and I'm not as firm as your devotees. Right now I'm being torn in half. Māyā is so strong and I see so much of what you say. Is there...,Prabhupāda, What is this?
New Devotee,Doubts.,Prabhupāda, What is your doubt?
New Devotee,Mental speculation.,Prabhupāda, So you want to continue it or stop it?
New Devotee,Stop it.,Prabhupāda," Then stop it. Take instruction from the śāstra . Don't speculate. That will not help you. The same example, a child's speculation, ""Who is my father?"" He will never be successful. But as soon as he asks his mother, ""Who is my father?"" Immediately knowledge: ""Here is your father."" Finished."
New Devotee,Association is very important.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
New Devotee,Association.,Prabhupāda," Yes. One has to take information from the authority. That knowledge is perfect. And these rascals, philosophical, scientific speculation, all useless waste of time."
New Devotee,"I live in Long Beach and I will be going to school soon, but I'm...",Prabhupāda," Hm. We don't accept any speculative knowledge. We want final conclusion of the experienced person. Nṛpa -nirṇītaḥ, this word is used. Nṛpa -nirṇītaḥ, it is concluded. Kavibhir nirūpitaḥ . Idaṁ hi puṁsas śrutas..., tapasaḥ śrutasya vā . Avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpitaḥ . Nirṇītaḥ... These words are... It is already concluded. There is no question of argument. In the Vedic literature, these words are used, nṛpa -nirṇītaḥ, nirūpitaḥ ."
New Devotee,I should abandon...,Prabhupāda," Nāsato vidyate bhāvo nā ..., asataḥ vidyate bhāvaḥ . What is the next line? So, we take things which is conclusive. The scientists, they are making experiment, where is the beginning of life. Misled. They are thinking life is from matter. They have no experience. Still, the rascal Darwin gave a theory. They are persisting on it. They have no practical experience that life is coming from matter. That is called vṛścika - taṇḍula - nyāya . You have no experience in your country. We have got. Sometimes you'll find, scorpion is coming out from the stack of rice. You have seen it?"
Karandhara,"I haven't seen it, but I have heard of the example.",Prabhupāda," Yes. So they are thinking the rice is..., rice is producing the scorpion. It is called taṇḍula - vṛścika - nyāya . But rice cannot produce a life. The real fact is a scorpion lays down the egg within the rice, and by the fermentation it comes out. Just eggs. And the small creature comes out. And foolish creatures, they think it that the rice is producing scorpion. That is not possible. So they are putting forward this evolution theory that man is coming from monkey, but no monkey is producing a man. Nobody has seen. There are so many things. They put forward some theory, but it is not fact."
New Devotee,The quickest way to knowledge...,Prabhupāda," Quickest way to knowledge... That I told you; take the knowledge from the authority. The example I have already given that you cannot make research, search out who is your father. But if you go to the authority, mother, immediately you understand. This is the quickest way."
New Devotee,"The thing that's tearing me apart is, um...",Prabhupāda," But just try to understand this. The principle is that if you receive knowledge from the real authority, that is perfect and quick. And if with your imperfect senses you want to acquire knowledge by searching out, it will never be successful. The modern method is to search out the truth by their imperfect senses. All these scientists, philosophers, they are doing that. They admit that their senses are imperfect. Still, they are trying to go to the perfect by the imperfect senses. This is their defect. They are hoping that ""Our imperfectness will be perfect by this research work."" That is not possible. Imperfectness will remain ever imperfect."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : They glorify such imperfections, Śrīla Prabhupāda, by saying...",Prabhupāda," Unless they glorify their imperfection, how they can stand? (laughter) They have no standing. If they do not glorify, then they are proved rascals. There will be no argument. They'll have to accept that ""we are rascals."" Therefore they have to glorify. The glorifying society... That is mentioned in the Bhāgavata . The glorifying society is consisting of ass, camel, hog, and what is the other?"
Devotees,Dog.,Prabhupāda," Dog. So we... śva -viḍ-varāhoṣṭra- kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ [ SB 2.3.19 ] . They are all ass, camels, dogs, like that and they are praising each other. ""Oh, you have discovered this. Oh, how nice you are. (laughter) How nice you are."" But we understand the praiser and the praised, both are dogs and cats. That's all. So we don't give any benefit. It is a mutual praising society of cats and dogs, so we don't give any benefit. Now, they can also accuse us in the same way, that ""You are also the society of cats and dog, mutual praising society."" So... Now, who will judge whether they are right or we are right? Who will judge? Eh? There must be some judgement. Everyone will say that ""I am right."" But who judges? There must be a judge, that through both side the lawyers is fighting, that ""My case is right."" Then who will give judgement? There must be one judge. So who is that judge?"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : śāstra , guru , sādhu .",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. That is the judge. Therefore we quote from Vedic literatures. As soon as we speak something, immediately quote Vedic literature. That is the way."
Karandhara,The trouble is there are so many phony gurus and śāstras.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,There are so many misrepresentations.,Prabhupāda," Because their folly is... They therefore do not take authority. Otherwise they'll be exposed. Yes. śāstra - cakṣusā . Yaḥ śāstra - vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma - kārataḥ [ Bg . 16.23 ] . These are the injunctions. (dog barks) Yes, come on. We have got your punishment. So there is an argument: pala bonatu hoya (?). ""I'm not afraid of you. Although I'm, I'm going away, I'm not afraid of you. (laughter) Don't think that I am afraid of you."" This is dog business. They'll go, ""gow!"" and go away, go away. They'll not come forward. Come on. (laughter) [break] Well, our every day is a New Year. Nava -navayauvana. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice, the more you advance, you see new year, new year. That's all. Nothing is old. People are seeing that they are simply chanting the old slogan, Hare Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotee,Hare Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," But we are feeling new pleasure in every moment. Take any other chanting, you cannot chant more than few hours. But the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra we can chant perpetually. So unless there is new enlightenment, how we can do that? [break] You can preach here, and then we are starting on the..., by the fourteenth. We shall go together to India. Is that all right? What do you think?"
Karandhara,Are you bringing your boys over there?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā; Karandhara; Gurukṛpā,They're going separate.; Oh.; If we go the other way it's cheaper.,Prabhupāda, Which way?
Karandhara,Through New York.,Prabhupāda, [break] I cannot go there. You see? As if three hundred miles away.
Gurukṛpā,[break] We saw from the plane.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā; Yaśodānandana,Forty-five minutes on the plane from Miami we saw the comet.; It was there for forty-five minutes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, a bad sign..."
Yaśodānandana,As big as the sky.,Prabhupāda, How big?
Yaśodānandana; Gurukṛpā; Devotee; Gurukṛpā,"Big as the sky. It was flashing for forty-five minutes, this big...; Flashing in horizontal directions.; The four or five first flashes were very, very big and regularly every thirty seconds it was big flash, bigger than lightning, brighter, very bright.; Very brilliant.",Prabhupāda, One part like this?
Gurukṛpā; Devotee; Gurukṛpā,"Yes, very fast.; Across the sky, shooot, shooot, shooot. Very fast.; About forty-five min..., we..., it was still going but the plane passed it and it stayed behind.",Prabhupāda," Uh, so, this is a bad sign. Constellation. According to astronomical calculations. Therefore we, we follow the astrology according to the constellation. The child born, everything has connection, the constellation of the star has influence on the child. So therefore the horoscope-maker takes the calculation of the constellation and then calculate what is his future. This dhūmaketu is described in Daśāvatāra- stotra , dhūmaketum iva kim api karālam . Dhūmaketum iva . Dhūmaketum iva kim api karālam . As soon as there is comet, there will be some disaster. Very great disaster. In our childhood we saw the comet, not this like. That was small comet. Still, the first world war was there declared. That we have seen in 1914."
Nara-nārāyaṇa,Nara - nārāyaṇa : Halley's comet.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Nara-nārāyaṇa,Nara - nārāyaṇa : I think they called it Halley's comet. Halley's comet.,Prabhupāda," Now the... You can expect at any moment disaster in this material world, but the comet is the sign that there will be some great disaster. It is... This material world, in every step there is disaster. Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām [SB 10.14.58] . But those who have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa , the disaster is not meant for them. Samāśritā ye pada - pallava -plavam. Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām . So how big it is?"
Gurukṛpā,Very big.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā,It was very spectacular. Something like twenty miles.,Prabhupāda, Twenty miles?
Yaśodānandana; Jayatīrtha,"Maybe at least fifty, sixty miles the four, five first flashes, very big. Let's see. From this tree all the way to the end of this tennis court, all over the sky. Big white flashings. Like big huge incredible lightning. Then afterwards it decreased, and then regularly, every thirty, forty-five seconds, there was big lightning. Not lightning, big flashes. Very uncommon.; The scientists say that it's eighty-three million miles long...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Jayatīrtha,"The scientists, they say that it's 83 million miles long, the comet.",Prabhupāda, 83 miles?
Jayatīrtha; Karandhara,83 million miles.; The tail.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,"The tail is 83 million miles. It's going fast, very forward, so it's emitting a tail of gases.",Prabhupāda, So who is supplying the gas? (laughter) The Arabians?
Jayatīrtha; Gurukṛpā,"There's no shortage.; When it comes to doing the kīrtana , there's no energy shortage for us. We have unlimited stock.",Prabhupāda," By presence of the comet, the atmosphere is also polluted. Last time, what I saw, it was like this. Round and then tail. It is like that?"
Gurukṛpā,No.,Prabhupāda, No.
Gurukṛpā,"A long streak. It was behind the clouds. There were many clouds, and you could see it through the clouds.",Prabhupāda," What is the speed? If it is 83 million miles, very heavy thing, then the speed must be also."
Karandhara; Prajāpati,"Well, the speed is very great. I don't know exactly what it is, but it's millions of miles per hour. Perhaps not millions of miles. Hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.; Prajāpati : There must be living entities then on the comet. Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Oh yes. Everywhere there are living entities.
Jayatīrtha,Scientists are very excited about the comet because they think that it's made of the primordial substance of the universe and they think they'll be able to find out some clue how the solar system was created by examining the comet with their telescopes. (laughter),Prabhupāda," Let them talk all nonsense. We say in Bengali, pāgale ki nā bole , chāgale ki nā khāya . The goat can eat everything, and a madman can speak anything. (laughter) Pāgale ki nā khāya ..., pāgale ki nā bole , chāgale ki nā khāya ."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Are the living entities on the comet, are they very demoniac or intelligent or...?",Prabhupāda, Not necessarily demoniac. Two classes of men are always there: intelligent and demon. [break]
Karandhara,"...comet. They just discovered it one or two years ago. They said that if it ever passed by the earth before, it was the time of the dinosaurs.",Prabhupāda, Dinosaur?
Karandhara,Yes. Over fifty thousand years ago.,Prabhupāda," (chuckles) He cannot say what happened yesterday, and he's speaking fifty thousand years. Is there a statement in any śāstra or his own statement?"
Karandhara,"No, that's by mathematical calculation of the trajectory and speed.",Prabhupāda," Oh, mathematics..."
Karandhara,It's going at a certain speed in a certain orbit. So they calculate that it would complete that orbit once every fifty to two hundred thousand years.,Prabhupāda," That is there in astrology, astronomy. That is not discovery."
Karandhara,"No, actually, one scientist just looked at a telescope and saw it coming. And that's what they call discovery. And of course, he got the comet named after him.",Prabhupāda, Who?
Karandhara,The scientist. His name was Kahotek. So he discovered it. So the comet is named after him.,Prabhupāda, And if it is mentioned elsewhere?
Karandhara,I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.,Prabhupāda," No, if... In some astrological book, if it is mentioned there?"
Karandhara; Prajāpati; Karandhara,"Scientists probably won't accept it. They think if they don't discover it, then it's not bona fide.; Prajāpati : Unless one of them discovers it in the book.; Ah. Yes.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Prajāpati; Karandhara,"Prajāpati : If one of them discovers it in the śāstras, then, oh, they'll...; They say they've looked through all the old books and the old records and they haven't found any mention of it.",Prabhupāda, I think in the Indian astronomical calendar there must be mention.
Nara-nārāyaṇa,Nara - nārāyaṇa : [break] ...effect of comet?,Prabhupāda," No, generally we know when there is comet, there is very bad effect."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : The comet doesn't really bring the bad effect. It simply is a symptom. Is that it?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : The comet doesn't bring the bad effect, it is a symptom.",Prabhupāda," No, yes, bring, bring."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : It does bring it.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Does such a comet affect consciousness as well as matter?,Prabhupāda," Eh? Comet is just like a planet. It is a vehicle carrying so many conscious beings. It is just like if some policeman all of a sudden comes before us, it is to be supposed that someone is criminal, he's searching. Like that. (end)"
Devotee (1),"Yes, I did.",Prabhupāda, You give me... [break]
Devotee (2),He's in the... Parking the car.,Prabhupāda," Oh. [break] ...plan for wasting time. (devotees laugh) So the material world means they have got different devices for wasting time, not for utilizing time. Is it correct?"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : It is considered one of our major problems, leisure time. People are having more time on their hands and they do not know what to do with it. So the government, they're scratching their heads inventing things for people to waste their time.",Prabhupāda," This is the difficulty. Na te viduḥ svārtha- gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB 7.5.31 ] . Because they are rascal, they do not know how to utilize time, what is the aim of life, where you have to go. These things they don't know. So they must waste time. So it is the... Just like child. He wastes time in so many ways. It is the duty of the parents, guardians, to cr..., synchronize his activities so that he may not waste his time. It is the duty of the guardians. Similarly these rascals, they're wasting time. You have to engage them in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then their time will be utilized. [break]"
Devotee (3),"...in Holland wasn't any fuel Sundays, and the people could go outside with the cars, and then the statistics say that the fight between the family increased so, so much the police went... They went to the houses to, just to separate the people because there was fighting so much because they didn't have anywhere to go on Sundays. (devotees laugh)",Prabhupāda," Just see. It has become a problem, ah, to remain at home. [break]"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...society, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it would train up brahminical qualities. But in the people in general, how can we engage them also in Kṛṣṇa consciousness? How can we provide them a means to use their leisure time to perfect their lives?",Prabhupāda, Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa . Is it very difficult?
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : To get them to do it is difficult.,Prabhupāda," Yes, let's call them in our temple, be practiced. Therefore our society is the most important society. We can teach people how to utilize time properly and be perfect. [break]"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...well you utilize your time, Śrīla Prabhupāda, every second is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. And our advanced Godbrothers, they've also learned this art. The vast majority of us, we haven't quite got the hang of it yet.",Prabhupāda," It is practiced. As by practicing you become a first-class drunkard, similarly by practicing you can become a first-class Kṛṣṇa conscious. It is equal. Abhyāsa - yoga - yuktena cetasā nānya- gāminā [Bg. 8.8 ] . Abhyāsa . Practice. In association the practice is very easily done. Just like you are saying, that you are engaged. So by association you can learn also. The association is very important. [break]"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're very, very regulated, almost down to the minute in your activities. This is also a big help in utilizing time?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Avyartha kāla tam (?) That explains the... This is... This should be our aim. Not a single moment is wasted. If you try that ""How I'm wasting my time,"" then you'll utilize it. You should always remember. Not a single moment should be wasted. That is advised by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Avyartha kāla tam . Vyartha means spoiling. Avyartha means not spoiling. Avyartha kāla . He should be always conscious that ""I am not wasting my time."" Then it will be done. Kṛṣṇa ... [break] ...on the street. The bums, they also utilize, that they want to see that not a moment is wasted without drinking. (devotees chuckle) Yes, they actually do that. They want to drink only, twenty-four hours. As soon as the bottle is finished, they're finding somebody who will pay one dollar, and purchase another small bottle. They're doing only business this. [break]"
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : ...the holy name and devotional service.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : You want us to be drunkards on the holy name, and be like those...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. There is eight kinds of transcendental transformation... (pause) (devotees chant japa ) [break]"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...foolish play tennis, and the lazy foolish they play golf. (Prabhupāda laughs) [break]",Prabhupāda, ...less dangerous than the active foolish. (devotees chant japa ) [break]
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : In the Bhagavad- gītā it is indicated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa that when we approach a bona fide spiritual master our relationship is twofold. We render service and then we also make inquiry.,Prabhupāda, Yeah.
Prajāpati; Devotee (4),"Prajāpati : Now, you have answered all our inquiries so thoroughly in our books that to make inquiry at this point seems like..., you've already answered all the questions. So how may we... What is the proper relationship at that point to make inquiry?; Read the books.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Read the books, yes. Why I'm working so hard? Read the books. [break] ...don't find him in the class also."
Devotee (4),"Who should, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Śrutakīrti.
Devotees; Devotee (5); Yaśodānandana,(indistinct); He got married yesterday.; I heard yesterday he was married.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Yaśodānandana,"He went to officially. I... We tried yesterday to convince him, but he would not listen.",Prabhupāda, Officially he's married now.
Devotee,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda," ...seen that one who is married, he's lamenting, and who is not married, he's also lamenting. Is it not? Ah? One who is married, he's thinking, ""Why did I marry? I would have remained free."" He's lamenting. And who is not married, ""Oh, I did not accept wife. I would have been happy."" (laughs) (Hindi) There's a Hindi... It just like (Hindi). One who has eaten, he's also lamenting, and who has not eaten, he's also lamenting. [break] Tṛpyanti neha ... That is said in Sanskrit. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ [SB 7.9.45 ] . Kṛpaṇā , by one's sex life he gets some children and he's... As soon as there is child, there is suffering. The child is suffering and the parents also suffering to take care. So, again he begets another child. Therefore it is said tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ . Behind this child-producing there is so much difficulties and trouble. He knows that. But again pro... Doing the same thing. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu - duḥkha - bhājaḥ . Therefore a sane person, kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ . Therefore one who is dhīra , one who becomes sober, he tolerates the sensations, itching sensations. It is after all itching sensation. So one who can tolerate the itching sensation, he saves so much trouble. But one who cannot, he's implicated, immediately. Either illicit or legitimate, it is trouble. Yan maithunādi... That is the only happiness in this material world. That is only happiness. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45 ] . One who wants to remain in this material world, his only happiness is sex life. He has no other happiness. Yan maithunādi- gṛhamedhi - sukhaṁ hi tuccham . And that is very abominable, tuccham happiness. What is this happiness? But they cannot understand. Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha - duḥkham . Itching, between the two hands. It produces so many bad results, but he's not satisfied. ""All right, I've done once, that's all right. One children is all right, one or two."" But no, then contraceptive, abortion, so many things. But the māyā is so strong, it will induce, ""Yes, do this."" Again implicated. [break] Becoming master of the dog, he has become servant of the dog."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Yes.,Prabhupāda, Just see practically. A man keeps the dog to give him protection when he'll be attacked by somebody. But to wait for that time he has to give twenty-four-hour service to the dog. (dog barking)
Devotee (1),I think he knows you're talking about him.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (1),I think the dog knows you're talking about him.,Prabhupāda, He knows everything. [break]
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Everything looks brand new, looks very different.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : This is the first time we've gone this direction, everything looks different, looks like a total different place.",Prabhupāda," (chuckles) This is material life. We are rounding sometimes this way, sometimes that way, and we are thinking ""new."" (devotees laugh) Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona [Cc. Madhya 19.151 ] . In this way you are wandering all over the universe. Find out something new. But there is nothing new. Everything is old. [break] ...a living entity is offered change of the body. You see? When he becomes fatigued of this life, ""It's so troublesome""—old men generally think like that. So he has to change another, another new body, child. Since born he is taken care, he thinks ""Now, I have got so comfortable life."" And again becomes old, disgusted, so he cannot live disgusting, therefore Kṛṣṇa is so kind: ""All right, change body again."" Punaḥ punaś carvita - carvaṇānām [SB 7.5.30 ] . Chewing the chewed. The business is the same, but changing body gives some relief. Just like these men, the business is they're wasting time by changing, wasting time at home, come to the golf club. That's all. The business is the same—wasting time, either here or there. Kṛṣṇa is giving so much facilities. Sometimes, ""All right, you become tree."" ""All right, some, become a serpent,"" ""All right, you become a demigod,"" ""All right, you become a human being,"" ""All right, you become king,"" ""You become a cobbler,"" ""You go to the heavenly planets,"" ""Go to the hellish planets."" Varieties is there. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He's changing varieties, atmosphere of life. But he's packed up in this material world. That freedom... He's asking for freedom, but he does not know the freedom is the shelter of Kṛṣṇa . That he'll not accept. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has arranged so many varieties. In disgust the Māyāvādīs, they want to make the varieties variety-less, nirviśeṣa . And the Buddhists they want to make it zero. But that is also not possible. Remain zero for some time. Again he will want varieties. Big, big Māyāvādī sannyāsī , they preach so much brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā , but again they come to the political work, social work. Simply remain as brahma , ""I am brahma , "" you cannot remain for many days. Then he has to accept these material varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment, so therefore our proposition is ""Come to the real variety, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then your life will be successful."""
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : The Māyāvādīs, they not only misunderstand the nature of the Absolute, they misunderstand the function of the jīva .",Prabhupāda," Yes. When one misunderstands, he misunderstands everything. One who commits mistake, he can commit mistakes in so many ways. They want to merge into the Absolute. They think that there is no variety, to avoid this variety. Ah? Just like sometimes one is suffering from some disease, they commit suicide. He thinks, ""I'm suffering. If I commit suicide, then everything will be stopped."" But he does not know that by committing suicide he'll increase another set of varieties of miserable conditions of life. He'll become ghost. And becoming ghost, you cannot enjoy anything grossly. The subtle body will create disturbance. Therefore ghost creates disturbance. He hasn't got gross body to enjoy. They're ghostly haunted; therefore a male ghost haunts over woman, woman ghost haunts over man. You know that? It so happens. Ghostly haunted."
Yaśodānandana,In the New York temple they had a ghost upstairs.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Yaśodānandana,The New York temple in Brooklyn...,Prabhupāda, Aha .
Yaśodānandana,"This is, this was the old house which was used by nuns. And in the upstairs floor, on the complete top, there used to be some nuns that were dying there, very old nuns. And when they moved into the temple there was ghosts, still there, still there is there. There's one room, it still comes.",Prabhupāda, Comes?
Yaśodānandana,Yes. The ghost comes sometimes. They chant and put incense.,Prabhupāda, Ācchā? But she does not go away? Or does not do any harm?
Gurukṛpā,They don't let anyone sleep in that room.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Gurukṛpā,Because everyone is haunted. There's many people have seen the ghost.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Yaśodānandana,Many devotees.,Prabhupāda," But ghost cannot remain where there is chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa . [break] In India, all collections should be utilized for Vṛndāvana temple. I shall personally supervise. So bring all collection to me."
Devotee,When we go to India.,Prabhupāda, Yes. [break] ...who has got (indistinct).
Devotee; Satsvarūpa,"The Rose Bowl.; Rāmeśvara said he had the figures, but I have to get them from him. [break]",Prabhupāda," That is human life. Your choice, make your choice, which way. Again death or deathlessness. Stop death from you. This is human life. The karmīs, jñānīs, yogis, they're trying for death. There will be death. But for the bhaktas, devotees, there is deathlessness. Punar janma jayāya . For conquering over next birth. Rascal civilized man does not know what is next life, how death can be stopped. Nothing else. Big, big scholars of Bhagavad- gītā , they do not understand. The so-called scholars, they do not understand. These things are there in the Bhagavad- gītā . Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. 4.9 ] . Yad gatvā na nivartante [Bg. 15.6 ]. They do not understand. They say, ""What is this?"" They do not understand. [break]"
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : ...people could not enjoy so much in this life, they worry more about the next life.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : When people realize they cannot enjoy so much in this life, they worry more about what is going to happen to them in the next life.",Prabhupāda," No, how does... They do not know what is next life?"
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : They don't know.,Prabhupāda," They make it zero. Therefore, closing the eye. ""There is no next life. Finished. There is no next life."" In that way they're satisfied. Just like the rabbit. There is danger, enemy, he closes his eyes. He thinks there is no danger. (devotees laugh) So these rascals are like that. Because they cannot accommodate that this life is so troublesome, again, next life... So that they can realize. Next life means again troublesome; that's why they sometimes commit suicide. They think that after suicide it will be zero, so no trouble. These are all ignorance."
Karandhara,In psychology that's called repression.,Prabhupāda, Repression.
Karandhara,"Taking something which is a fact, but refusing to believe it, pushing it out of your mind, repressing it.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : There is a philosophy called Stoicism. They believe they... This life is meant to suffer, so they should just become very sturdy to suffer a great deal.",Prabhupāda," So sturdy or not sturdy, you have to suffer. How you can check? We cannot change by simply... Becoming sturdy..."
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : No, stoic.",Prabhupāda, Ah. What is that?
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : It's a philosophy, a school of philosophy, stoic.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. What is their conclusion?"
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : That the world is very, is full of suffering...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
BaliMardana; Yaśodānandana,Bali Mardana : ...so they become very sturdy to bear the suffering.; Emotionless.,Prabhupāda," So one who can suffer without any protest, he's first-class man."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : (laughs) Yeah.,Prabhupāda, That means they do not know how to stop suffering.
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Yeah.,Prabhupāda," The... Here is one class, they're trying to become very strong to tolerate suffering, and other philosophies, they're making everything zero. There is no question of not suffering, but making zero. No suffering, nor neither suffering. Suffering or not..., both of them abolished, dismissed. This philosopher is... ""This suffering cannot be dismissed. Therefore you be strong to tolerate it."" Other philosophers they say, ""There is suffering, so make it zero."" But both of them have no information that there is real life where there is no suffering. Still there is life. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is life, but no suffering."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : They're like owls.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (pause)
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : There's a river. [break],Prabhupāda," ... duḥkha - nivṛtti . Ultimately, stop of all sufferings. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt ( Vedānta - sūtra 1.1.12) . Simply ānanda . Dancing with Kṛṣṇa , rāsa dance. Supposing if there is such life—dancing and eating and chanting, no suffering. So would anybody deny that? Is there any such fool?"
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : Yeah, they're all denying.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : They deny. Just like the Puritans...,Prabhupāda," No, no. Deny... You deny or accept, that is the... Suppose there is such life where you can simply dance, eat and live eternally, happy life. Would you not like to accept it?"
Devotee (2),"Yes, of course, anyone would.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2),Anyone would like to accept that.,Prabhupāda, You see? That we are giving.
Devotee (2),But they think no such thing would exist.,Prabhupāda," They think, may think, but it is theoretical. Supposing there is such life, would you not accept it? You may believe, not believe. That is another chapter. First of all, this is our proposition, that there is a life like this. Would you like? So who would say ""no""? Everyone will say, ""Yes, I like."" It is a question of understanding. There is such life, but because he is disappointed at being cheated, cheated, cheated, he thinks, ""Here is also another cheating."" Just see. Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness preaching means to convince them that there is life like this. That is propaganda."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : What would convince them that it is simply not another cheating?,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is cheating, it is fact."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : But what would convince them of that? What qualities?,Prabhupāda," Just see example, our. We are chanting, dancing, and eating nicely. What you are doing? You are simply talking nonsense. There is no peace in your life. And see our devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the proof, practical proof."
Yaśodānandana,Practical proof that they cannot get purified.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Yaśodānandana,Even though they have big posts...,Prabhupāda," No, either purify or... You come with us and you will be purified. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, rādhā - kṛṣṇa bolo saṅge calo, ei - mātra bhikhā cāi . We don't want anything from you. You, I shall give you eating. I shall give you everything. You simply come with me and chant. This is our propaganda. We don't say that ""You do this, do that."" We don't do anything. Simply come with us and chant."
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : Just like the Catholic church, in different places around the world they feed the people.",Prabhupāda, Ah.
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : But we cannot only... If we not only feed them, but give them chanting and dancing...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : ...they will accept it as superior.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),"Actually we can see that happening very practically. At Spiritual Sky many big, big businessmen they come, and they see how these boys are making money and yet they are singing and dancing all the time. (laughs)",Prabhupāda," This is practical. It's practical. Therefore in India we are considered as the richest community. They was a question in Parliament, ""Wherefrom these Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement they get their money?"" And the Parliament would reply, Home Member, that ""They get money by distributing literature."" This is the reply. This is recorded in the Parliament, Indian Parliament."
Hṛdayānanda,Hṛdayānanda : Delhi.,Prabhupāda," So if you simply push on our literature, then our movement is going, you must know. It is really going forward. And there will be no scarcity. You'll get everything. [break] Our neighbors they inquire, is it not? That, ""You are living so happily, where do you get money?"""
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," The storekeepers, they inquire. They're envious, that ""How these people enjoying life without earning, without working hard?"" Now whole Bombay is surprised when you purchased this land."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Yeah.,Prabhupāda," So much fighting was there. Immediately I went and purchase and everything stopped. (devotees laugh) They are surprised. This man, they... You know there are two very stubborn parties who have cheated. Chaganlal, he advanced fifty-one thousand as advance, and when there was question of settlement, so he came, he wanted that ""If you give me three lakhs, then I'll compromise."" So I was prepared to pay him three lakhs. So that Mr. Ganotra, Mayor, I induced him just to make settlement. Then down he came-two lakhs twenty-five thousand. Then asked Mrs. Nair, ""Now you'll pay this..."" Where I have got... If he takes all money, then what shall I get? Then I had to settle with her how much he will pay. So she came from one lakh to one lakh, forty thousand. So what is the balance?"
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Sixty. Sixty... Eighty-five thousand.,Prabhupāda," Ah? Eighty-five. So I said, ""Yes, I'll pay it. Settle up. The balance I'll pay."" Eighty-five thousand. The other man, what is called? Ratna Parik?"
Karandhara,Chaganlal.,Prabhupāda," That Chaganlal this, I pay him extra eighty-five thousand. That is also black. No more white. So the black money was paid in this way, that the money was counted and it was put in a handbag, and it was locked by him. So the key was with him, and the bag was with me. As soon as court accepted the agreement, then I handed over, ""Take this bag."" Then again this Ratna Parik, he first of all proposed twenty thousand to sell that house. Then when I went there, he knew that he's settling at any cost, he said, ""Now that twenty thousand was cost formerly. Now things have gone very high, I cannot sell."" So he knows that we are eager to purchase. Then I said, ""Then what do you want to do?"" ""Now I want thirty thousand."" ""All right, yes. Take it."" I did not argue. In this way I settled up. And our Girirāja's father appreciated that ""It is better a bad settlement than to prolong the case."" So I took this policy. It is bad settlement, from twenty thousand to thirty thousand. But settled out. ""I give you 85,000 black."" But one thing I gain—that by cancelling the agreement, their proposal was that increase the price, twenty lakhs from fourteen lakhs. That was the arrangement between the attorneys. They cancelled the agreement and take twenty lakhs from him, and the balance should be divided by..., amongst us. That was the agreement. So that addition of twenty lakhs I satisfied Mrs. Nair by fourteen lakhs fifty thousand."
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : Saves 500,000, lakhs.",Prabhupāda," Yes. The attorneys were settling at seventeen lakhs, but by Kṛṣṇa's grace I was able to settle up fourteen lakhs fifty thousand."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : You were able to convince her to settle up for less.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Gurukṛpā,This was white?,Prabhupāda," Ah? Yes, fourteen lakhs fifty thousand white."
BaliMardana; Prabhupāda;; BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : She must've been very surprised to receive the money, such a large payment.; Yes. [break] ...only ten lakhs.; Bali Mardana : Yeah.",Prabhupāda, Then Karandhara sent... How much you sent?
Karandhara,"Excuse me, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, What you sent?
Karandhara,Sent twenty thousand.,Prabhupāda," Twenty thousand. That was... Not two lakhs, nowadays. Eight rupees. About one lakh sixty thousand. Then we had about three lakhs. In this way, somehow or other, we paid seven, more than sixteen lakhs. Black, white, everything."
Gurukṛpā,For Kṛṣṇa anything can be done.,Prabhupāda," She was to be paid fourteen lakhs fifty thousand, then stamp duty two lakhs ... Sixty thousand or six thousand? Then registration fee... Oh, it was very expensive. [break]"
Devotee (2),"...that at the end of this month the United States will be destroyed by the comet, the Kahutek comet.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Their demonic principles will be destroyed. They'll take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Devotees,"Jaya , haribol!",Prabhupāda," What do they say... After destruction, then what is next?"
Devotee (2),"Oh, they all move to Mexico and Canada, so they wouldn't be in the way of the destruction. They don't know what's going to happen after that.",Prabhupāda, So at the time of danger they'll go away. Very good. (devotees laugh)
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Lord Jesus came to save the fallen souls...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : ...they are all running away.,Prabhupāda," They are so good Christian that at the time of danger, they're all going away to Canada. Just see-afraid of death, even though they are preaching themselves, priest, they are also the same common man, afraid of death. And if we people keep to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are not afraid of death. For going from one place to another, that's all. Going home, nobody becomes afraid going back to home. He becomes pleased. [break] You avoid death, there is no death. Viṣaya . (?) If we simply practice this, Hare Kṛṣṇa , Hare Kṛṣṇa , Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma , Hare Rāma ... No more death. Finished death. This is a fact. [break] ...or do something for Kṛṣṇa . Don't waste time, single moment. Then your... No more death. Because this is deathless condition.

BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : So our service is deathless.,Prabhupāda, Ah? Deathless...
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Devotional service.,Prabhupāda," ...yes, this is deathless position."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : But if we stop serving...,Prabhupāda," You admit or not, theologian? (devotee laughs) Eh? Eh? Or you have got anything to say? This is deathlessness."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Because the soul is acting.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Ah?
Karandhara,"Looks like it may start raining a bit, Prabhupāda. We may cut over here.",Prabhupāda, All right.
Karandhara,And I can bring the car over.,Prabhupāda," No, no, what is that? We shall not die. (devotees laugh)"
BaliMardana; Prajāpati,Bali Mardana : We will melt.; Prajāpati : The soul cannot be wet.,Prabhupāda," No, it is pleasant. Viśvaṁ pūrṇa -sukhāyate. For a devotee, everything is very happy. There is no unhappiness. Any condition, they are happy. Viśvaṁ pūrṇa -sukhāyate. For nondevotees everything is a problem. (devotees laugh) And for devotee everything is happiness. That is the difference."
Devotees,Jaya . (thunder sounds in background),Prabhupāda," This is fact. This is not imaginary..., I mean to say... Kṛṣṇa says, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66 ] . The suffering is due to sinful activities. So a devotee is not acting sinfully; he's fully surrendered... (end)"

BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : The Christians are so foolish, even though they have big learned positions, they do not understand that the animal also has a soul.",Prabhupāda, You told? In that meeting?
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Yeah.,Prabhupāda, What did they say?
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : They could not deny. They could not say anything.,Prabhupāda," Yes, what is the difference that you say the animals...? How do you say? What is the symptoms of possessing soul? The symptoms of possessing soul is described in the Bhagavad- gītā : yena sarvam idaṁ tatam . The consciousness. The animals have no consciousness? How foolish they are!"
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Just to rationalize their sins.,Prabhupāda, Yes. No. Rational or not rational...
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : No, to rationalize their meat-eating, they say...",Prabhupāda," Yes, to support, yes, their sinful activities."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Yes.,Prabhupāda, How you can say there is no soul in the animals? What is the reason? What is their reason?
Satsvarūpa,"At one interview a person said to you, ""They do not understand metaphysics, and the human being understands metaphysics.""",Prabhupāda," Metaphysics. A child also does not understand. So therefore he has no soul? Cut him? They are doing that. They are doing that, so rascal. So do everyone understand metaphysics."
Karandhara; Satsvarūpa,No.; They should not be killed if they don't understand.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,They should not be killed just if they don't understand.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Is that any reason?
Devotee,"Actually, they have no philosophical basis for that belief that the animal has no soul. It's just speculation. Yes.",Prabhupāda, No philosophy. Simply rascaldom. Simply rascaldom. And that is being preached by the priestly class. Priestly class. Just see the society! What third-class society! (pause) [break] ...the soul enters after the birth of the child. Eh? Is it not? Therefore killing or abortion is not bad.
Devotee,"Oh, they say that abortion isn't bad because the child is not fully formed and therefore is not really a life. It's not really alive.",Prabhupāda," Just see. Therefore one man who is sleeping, he has no soul."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : No one... They do not believe that generally.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : They admit that they are killing.,Prabhupāda, They admit?
BaliMardana; Gurukṛpā,Bali Mardana : That they are killing the child. But they do not care. 'Cause they don't want to take the trouble to raise it.; Just like the rabbit.,Prabhupāda," Rabbit philosophy.

Simply you make propaganda that what is real leadership. Then they will inquire and we shall reply. [break] ...so many things. So we may not create any disruption amongst our solidarity.

I told them it was all wrong and everything, and uh... But there is many, many innocent people who are following.

Satsvarūpa; Hanumān,"Were they chanting, ""Jaya Lord Caitanya , Nityānanda Prabhu ?""; Hanumān : Yes, they also chanting, ""Bhaja śrī - kṛṣṇa - caitanya . "" Yes.

Hanumān; Satsvarūpa,Hanumān : So that's all right.; As long as that Vaiṣṇava is following the principles.,Prabhupāda, But they should not attempt like that in the presence of their spiritual master. That is not good. When you found this?
Satsvarūpa; Hanumān,"When did you find they were doing this?; Hanumān : When I was there. I was in Brazil about three months ago. And the only books they had published is a book written by Siddha - svarūpa Gosvāmī. They had published one book of him, and they were distributing this.",Prabhupāda, What is the name of that book?
Hanumān,"Hanumān : It was an introduction to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, question and answer.",Prabhupāda, You have seen that book?
Hanumān,"Hanumān : Yes, Prabhupāda. I have give to Karandhara.",Prabhupāda, So is there anything awkward against our devotional life?
Karandhara,I can't read it. It's in Portuguese.,Prabhupāda," Oh, it was in Portuguese language."

Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Jaya . Your lecture this morning was brilliant, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your logic could defeat anybody. (Prabhupāda chuckles) The theological rascals, though, they will not accept any authority except their own mind. They are such nonsense.",Prabhupāda," That is called mano - dharmī . In Sanskrit it is called mano - dharmī , mental speculators."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : It's a disease, actually.",Prabhupāda," And therefore, mental speculators, they have been condemned. Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB 5.18.12 ] . Because they carry on, or they are carried by the chariot of mind, manorathena . Manorathena asati . Manoratha , when you drive on the chariot of mind, you cannot get any fixed idea. Because mind is flickering. Saṅkalpa - vikalpa . Mind's business is ""Accept this, and again reject it."" So all these speculators are doing. Somebody is putting forward some theory, and after some years he will himself reject or somebody else will reject. So manorathena , by mental speculation, you remain on the material platform. You cannot get any spiritual idea. Therefore harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad- guṇāḥ . Anyone who is not in the spiritual platform... Spiritual platform means to be a devotee of the Lord. The Māyāvādīs, because they are not devotees of the Lord, they are not on the spiritual platform. They are on the material platform. They are speculating, spirit—""something negation of matter."" That's all. That is mental speculation. It is bad. ""Good means negation of bad."" They are thinking like that. They do not know, in this material world, bad and good are both the same thing. Because it is matter. That they do not know. They think, ""This is bad, this is good."" But they do not know, materially conceived anything, good or bad, they are the same thing. That they do not know."
Bahulāśva,"How is bad and good the same thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Just like we are walking on this street. Sometimes we say, ""This is very good."" And sometimes, ""It is very bad."" But the street is the same. So how it is good and bad? This is simply mental speculation."
Bahulāśva,Sense perception?,Prabhupāda," Eh? Mental speculation. When it is dry... So dryness also, sometimes it is, ""Oh, it is very dry, bad."" And again, say dry, we shall say, ""Oh, today is very good."" It is simply mental speculation."
Devotee,It is like wet stool and dry stool. It is still stool.,Prabhupāda," Eh? Yes. (Chuckles) Yes, that is the example. The dry part of the stool, they say, ""Oh, this part is very nice."" He forgets that, after all, it is stool. So what is the dry or moist? Just like they are making scientific advancement. But the death is there. So what is the use of your advancement or no advancement? One who has not advanced in science, he'll also die. And you'll also die, advanced. Then what is the good? You cannot protect yourself from death. Then what is the meaning of this ""good""? ""This is good. This is advancement, and this is not advancement."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : But the distinction, the good and bad...",Prabhupāda, That is your distinction. You have made such distinction.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : I think that depends on the consciousness of the individual.,Prabhupāda," Relativity, relativity, law of Relativity. What is, what is food for one is death for other, the same thing. So how you can say the food is good or bad? Is it not? ""One man's food, another man's poison."" So how you can distinguish this is food or poison? One man will say, ""No, it is food."" Another man will say, ""It is poison."" So how you'll distinguish? So this good and bad is simply mental speculation. Because it is in the material platform, there is nothing good. Everything is bad. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa said, sarva - dharmān parityajya [Bg. 18.66 ] . In the name of ""dharma, "" so many rascaldom is going on. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya . It is not dharma . And Bhāgavata says, dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo 'tra: [SB 1.1.2 ] ""This cheating type of religious system is rejected from Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam . "" All so-called religions, they're simply cheating. Cheating. Dharmaḥ projjhita - kaitavaḥ . Kaitavaḥ means cheating. Everything is cheating. They say, ""We are advancing."" What you are advancing? The problem, birth-death, is there. So what is the meaning of your advancement? Dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB 1.1.2 ] ."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : This is the only means, then, to get off that manorathena .",Prabhupāda," Manorathena , yes. Manorathena means if you remain on that platform, then you have to reject again. Just they are doing, the so-called scientists, philosophers. They are putting forward some theory, and after some time they reject it. So if you remain on the mental platform, then this business of accepting and rejecting will go on. You'll never come to a conclusion. Therefore one has to rise to the spiritual platform. That is nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre [Bg. 2.20 ] . That is eternal, everlasting."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Not a theory.,Prabhupāda, No. Yes.
Umāpati,They just constantly speculate on the material nature.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,They speculate on the material nature.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,And they can never be spiritual.,Prabhupāda," No, no."
Umāpati,Just always material.,Prabhupāda," Number of zeroes never make one. It is zero. You add thousands of zeroes, one after another, the value will be zero. Not one."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : But there is a theory, Śrīla Prabhupāda... Not theory. It's a fact, that if some number is raised to the power zero, that becomes one. In mathematics.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. But I am speaking that you combine millions of zeroes. That will never become one. That I am speaking. Zero is zero. Zero plus zero equal to zero. Zero minus zero equal to zero. Zero multiplied zero, zero. Zero divided by zero, zero. That's all. Where you get...? And by the side of zero, if you bring one, eko brahma , immediately it will become ten. And add another zero, immediately hundred, ten times increased. That one must be there, one God. Then zero increases value. Similarly, this material world is zero, but if there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it is valuable. Then it is valuable."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : But that manorathena , the chariot of the mind, that is never valuable.",Prabhupāda," No, it has no value."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : The whole western...,Prabhupāda," Manorathena asati dhāvato bahiḥ . By mental speculation, you will remain on this asati , in this temporary field. Asat means ""which will not exist."" Anything in this material world, you take, that will not exist. Anywhere man can say. The skyscraper building is constructed, but everyone knows that it will not exist. Some day it will fall down. Everyone knows. It will never exist. That is explained by Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad- gītā , that ""If you think that by combination of matter, life has come, so life was not there before the combination. And this combination will dismantle. So life, there will be no more life. So why these three period you are lamenting? There is life."" Because according to this theory—""The combination of matter makes life""—so before combination there was no life, and the combination dismantled, there is no life. So beginning and end no life. Why you are lamenting in the middle? Very good reasoning. Just see. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says, māyā - sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB 7.9.43 ] . Māyā - sukhāya , that illusory, illusory happiness. Māyā - sukhāya . And for that reason, they are making huge, gorgeous arrangement and working day and night, which will be zero. It has begun from zero and it will end into zero. In the middle they are busy. Just see. Therefore vimūḍhān ."
Hanumān,Hanumān : In your books you say that the world is like a dream.,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is dream."
Hanumān,Hanumān : How is it a dream?,Prabhupāda," Dream, just like last night you had some dream."
Hanumān,Hanumān : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Well, it has no value. It is gone. And again, this night, when you'll sleep, you'll forget all these things. You'll dream. You don't remember during night, when you are dreaming, that ""I have got my house, I have got my wife I have..."" You all forget. So it is dream."
Hanumān,Hanumān : It is true or is not true?,Prabhupāda," No, no. Where is true? You forget at night. Do you remember when you sleep that you have got your wife and you are sleeping on bed? You have gone some three thousand miles away and seeing something else. Do you remember that you have got a place to reside?"
Hanumān,Hanumān : No.,Prabhupāda," So this is dream at night. And night dream, what you saw at night, that is now dream. So both of them dream. You are simply visitor. That's all. You are seeing this dream and that dream. You are, you are fact, but what you are seeing, that is dream."
Hanumān,"Hanumān : But I have the impression that ""This is true, and my dream is not true."" What is the dif...?",Prabhupāda," No, no. Everything is untrue. How it is true? If it is true, why you forget at night? Why you forget? If it is true. Do you remember at night?"
Hanumān,"Hanumān : No, I don't remember.",Prabhupāda," Then? How it is true? As you don't remember the dreams which you saw last night..., That, therefore we say ""dream."" Similarly this thing, because you forget at night, this is also dream."
Hanumān,Hanumān : But I have...,Prabhupāda," This is day-dream, that is night-dream. That's all."
Bahulāśva,"Jaya . Day-dream and night-dream. And the night-dream, then you perceive that as being real.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Bahulāśva,"When you dream at night, then you think that is real.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is real. You cry... It is dream, but you are crying, ""There is tiger, tiger, tiger!"" Where is tiger? But you are seeing it is fact, tiger. ""I am being killed by a tiger."" But where is tiger. [break] ...in dream you are embracing some beautiful girl. Where is that beautiful girl? But actually this is happening."
Hanumān,Hanumān : Is it happening?,Prabhupāda," It is happening because there is discharge of semina, night pollution. But where is that girl? Is it not dream? So similarly this is also dream. You are having the effect of truthfulness, but it is a dream. Māyā ... Therefore it is called māyā - sukhāya . The same thing, that at night you are dreaming you are embracing nice beautiful girl, as there is no such thing, similarly, in the daytime also, whatever advancement you are making, this is also like that. Māyā - sukhāya . We are happy, we are dreaming, ""This process will make me happy. This process will make me happy."" But the whole process is dream only. You are taking this day-dream as reality because the duration is long. At night, when you dream, the duration is for half an hour. And this is for twelve hours, or more than that. That is the difference. It is a twelve hours' dream, and that is half an hour dream. But actually, both of them are dream. And because it is twelve hours' dream, you are taking it as, accepting it as real. That is called illusion."
Bahulāśva,Illusion.,Prabhupāda," Yes. We are making distinction between animal and ourself, but we're forgetting, we are forgetting, the animal also will die and I will also die. So where is my advancement? Will you remain? You'll also die. So where is your advancement upon animals? That is stated in śāstra : āhāra - nidra - bhaya -maithunaṁ ca samānam etat paśubhir narāṇām . Business—eating, sleeping, sex-life and defending—this is also animal's business. And you are also doing the same. How you are distinct from animal? You'll die. The animal will die. But if you say, ""I'll die after one hundred years, and this ant will die after one hour,"" that does not mean that you are in reality. It is a question of time. Just like this huge universe. It will be all be destroyed. As your body will be destroyed, this will be destroyed, annihilation, dissolution. Nature's way, everything will be dissolved. So therefore it is dream. It is a long duration dream. That's all. Nothing else. But the advantage is that even in this dream you can realize the reality, God. That is the... So if you don't take advantage of this dream, then you are missing."
Hanumān,Hanumān : So I am half asleep.,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is the... Therefore Vedas says, uttiṣṭhata. ""Get up, get up, get up!"" Jāgṛta. ""Become awakened."" Prāpya varaṁ nibodhata . ""Now you have got the opportunity. Utilize it."" This is Vedic injunction. Uttiṣṭhata jāgṛta prāpya varaṁ nibodhata . This is Vedic in... Tamasi mā jyotir gama. These are Vedic injunctions. So we are preaching the same thing, that ""Reality is here, Kṛṣṇa . Don't remain in this darkness. Come to this consciousness."" That is our preaching. Tamasi mā jyotir gama. [break] ...experienced the sunshine, bright day, and this gloomy day. So when you are in darkness, we must have to admit, ""There is light."" Because darkness means absence of light. So as we are in the darkness of this material existence, there must be something life of light. That is spiritual world. That is reality. [break] ... ahaṁ brahmāsmi. ""Oh, I don't belong to this darkness, darkness atmosphere. I belong to the light atmosphere."" That is self-realization. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi."
Hanumān,Hanumān : ...simultaneously in the dream and not in the dream. So when...,Prabhupāda," That is reality, when you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa . That is reality."
Hanumān,Hanumān : But I also see all this.,Prabhupāda," Eh? That is another thing. On the path of reality, you come."
Hanumān,Hanumān : On the path?,Prabhupāda," Yes. It is a process. When the process is complete, then you'll come to the reality. But that is the process. Ceto- darpaṇa - mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12 ]. We cannot distinguish now reality and non-reality because the heart is unclean. So we have to cleanse, and then we come to the reality."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : For that matter, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when one comes to that stage, there is no difference between animate and inanimate. Is that true?",Prabhupāda, Highest stage?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes.,Prabhupāda," Highest stage, everything animate."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes. So a stone... Even a stone has soul.,Prabhupāda," Oh yes, yes. Just like this tree. You cut; it does not protest. The consciousness is not developed. That is the... But it has got life. You scientists, you do not believe that stone has also life?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : No, they say it's just matter.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : They say there's no life there.,Prabhupāda," No, there is life."
Nitāi,Nitāi : Every stone has life?,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, dead stone has no... But there are many mountains, they are increasing. You know, at Benares there is a stone? Tila -bandhesvara. (?)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : I don't know.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That increases. If you go, see today, and go ten years after, you'll see—take the measurement—it has increased. They'll go..."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : But they will say that because of the position of the dust particles the size will increase. Even a small...,Prabhupāda," No, no, no. It is clean. There is no... It is being washed even. Its name is Tila -bandhesvara. (?) So there is no uncleanliness. Still, the body increases. There is still Tila -bandhesvara. (?) There is temple of Tila -bandhesvara. People go to see."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : But the consciousness is covered there.,Prabhupāda," Covered, yes. Dullness means consciousness is covered. You put a child in open air. He'll not feel much cold. You see practically. He'll not feel. Because consciousness is not developed. Animal, they will not feel cold. But we feel."
Bahulāśva,"But Prabhupāda, there are still such things as dead matter?",Prabhupāda, Not dead matter. The soul is there.
Bahulāśva,"Suppose something, well, something like this shoe that I'm wearing...,",Prabhupāda," It is now dead matter. But when you go, the higher understanding, it is a composition of atoms. So we learn from Vedic śāstra that within the atom there is life. Aṇḍāntara- stha - paramāṇu -cayāntara- sthaṁ govindam ādi - puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi [Bs. 5.35] . There is, there. If within the atom there is life, then what to speak of anything else."
Bahulāśva,That's a jīvātmā?,Prabhupāda," No, no. Govinda is there."
Bahulāśva,Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," When Kṛṣṇa is there, then Kṛṣṇa is there with everything. Kṛṣṇa cannot be alone."
Bahulāśva,"This is the real science, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Vijñāna . Yad vijñāna - samanvitam . Jñānaṁ parama - guhyaṁ me yad vijñāna - samanvitam . Is it not? Jñānaṁ me... ""My knowledge is very confidential and it is full of science."" Jñānaṁ parama - guhyaṁ me yad vijñāna - samanvitam . And in the Bhagavad- gītā there is said, ""Knowing this knowledge..."" Yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate . In the Vedas it is said, kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati . So this is the way. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa and everything will be known. [break] ... guhyaṁ pavitraṁ paramam idam . Eh? Bhagavad- gītā . Rāja - vidyā , the knowledge, the king of knowledge. [break]"
Hanumān,"Hanumān : Without your mercy, there's no way out of the dream of material life.",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa's. Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Yes. (pause) [break]
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : ...water is tasteless, but Kṛṣṇa says, ""I am the taste in water."" Science says water is tasteless, no taste in water.",Prabhupāda, Science says.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes.,Prabhupāda, But have you tasted that tasteless water? (laughter)
Gurukṛpā; Karandhara; SvarūpaDāmodara,"If it is so tasteless, why is it quenching?; If someone gives you a glass of water and you drink it, you immediately know what it is.; Svarūpa Dāmodara : They'll say the taste of water depends on the amount of chemicals contained in the water.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. So that is Kṛṣṇa . That is Kṛṣṇa . The tastefulness. Tastefulness of water is Kṛṣṇa . Not the water.
Bahulāśva; Gurukṛpā,"People have such a clouded idea of what is God, Śrīla Prabhupāda. When you explain it, it's very real.; Prabhupāda, the other day you mentioned that during the eating activities, during sex activity, there is increase of breathing.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Gurukṛpā,"Now, when we do the kīrtana , there is much increase of breathing. So what is the difference?",Prabhupāda, The difference is that... [Break] ...why your child is less conscious than yourself?
Gurukṛpā,Because he's not developed.,Prabhupāda," He's also living entity. Why he's foolish, and why you are intelligent? What is the answer?"
Gurukṛpā,Because the consciousness is more developed.,Prabhupāda, Then develop... So you develop your consciousness. Then you will understand Kṛṣṇa .
Gurukṛpā,So I must be more fortunate than the other living entities in my body.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā,The other living entities.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore it is called, human life is so valuable. You are not cats and dogs. You have got the opportunity to understand God, Kṛṣṇa ."
Devotee; Satsvarūpa,"Only by your mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end); We always say that the best way to water the tree is from the root, but he says that the way that nature actually waters is from the top.",Prabhupāda, So wherefrom the top water comes?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : By evaporation of the ocean.,Prabhupāda, And who kept the ocean? You go on.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : By nature.,Prabhupāda," Then you come to somebody. That is foolishness. Then nature is not ultimate. Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate. Because you cannot see Kṛṣṇa , therefore you say, ""Nature."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Kṛṣṇa says, ""Nature is under My control.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : It is just like an equilibrium, Śrīla Prabhupāda. In science it is called equilibrium, means this on and off...",Prabhupāda," It is called cakra . What is that? In Bhagavad- gītā it is said, brahma - cakra , brahma - cakra . Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma . That is realization, that in every action there is brahman . The beginning, by eating food grains, you become strong. The animals become strong. Then, when you become strong, you perform yajña , and from yajña , there is cloud, and from cloud, there is rain, and from rain, there is food grains. This is the cakra ."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : Cycle.,Prabhupāda," Cycle, yes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : That is the symptom of material nature.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So this yajña means to satisfy the Lord. Yajñārthe karma . So when you miss this yajña , then everything becomes disturbed. When you become godless then the whole thing will be disturbed. And practically also, if you pay income tax, then government arrangement is everything, nicely going on. And as soon as stop income tax, then whole thing... There is no finance, there is deficit, this, that, so many things. So yajña is yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra. Everything should be done for the Yajña , for Viṣṇu . Then everything is in order. In Kali - yuga , other, costly yajñas are not possible. Therefore yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana - prāyaiḥ . Saṅkīrtana . But these rascals will not take. If you say that ""This simple yajña , you take it. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra . All problems will be solved,"" they will not believe. They will not take it. They are so misfortunate. Śāstra says, yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana -prāyair yajanti hi su - medhasaḥ [SB 11.5.32] . Su - medhasaḥ . Those who have got good brain, they take up this yajña process. Su - medhasaḥ . And another word is alpa - medhasaḥ , less brain substance. Tad bhavaty alpa - medhasām . Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa - medhasām [Bg. 7.23 ] . They are doing all other things, but not yajña . Therefore alpa - medhasām : their brain substance is small. And here is su - medhasaḥ . Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana -prāyair yajanti hi su - medhasaḥ [SB 11.5.32] . That is the sign of merit: You do something which will produce good result. And if you, cats and dogs, if you simply jump over, what you will do result? That Lilavati Munshi of Bombay, she is the wife of a big man, K. Munshi. So she was asking, ""Swamiji, how you made like this?"" Everyone is surprised because nobody has done like this. I said that ""Because I have taken the proper method, therefore it is done so nicely."" The method must be right. It may be simple, but it must be right method."
Yaśomatīnandana,"She is Gujarati, Lilavati Munshi?",Prabhupāda, Ah yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan .,Prabhupāda," Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan , yes. She invited me this time."
Yaśomatīnandana,"She is writer, I think.",Prabhupāda," Yes. She is very educated. Now, her husband made very great attempt for publishing book, but there is no sufficient customer. Now the press is going to be sold, and nobody customer. That is letter-setting press. Now it is obsolete. So they were perplexed. She wanted that I shall purchase. And what shall I do with this press? Letter setting is now abolished. That is not good job now. There must be litho press or, what is called, offset. Yes."
Devotee; Gurukṛpā,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, if... Since Kṛṣṇa is the power that gives the demigods the ability to render everything, then why is it recommended in the Nectar of Devotion that a Vaiṣṇava should worship Gaṇapati?; When we were just traveling this last time and collecting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, everyday we were offering some incense to Gaṇeśa , and this prayer in the Brahma - saṁhitā , yat - pāda - pallava ...",Prabhupāda, Pallava - yugaṁ vinidhāya kumbha ...
Gurukṛpā; Yaśodānandana,"We were saying this, saying, ""Give us facility to collect nice lakṣmī to use to build the temple in Vṛndāvana .""; To build the temple for Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in Vṛndāvana .",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is good. Whatever possible facility is available from any person, we beg for it for Kṛṣṇa's service, not for our personal benefit. [break] ...they forget Kṛṣṇa . They forget Kṛṣṇa . When they go to worship some other demigod, they forget Kṛṣṇa , kāmais tais tair hṛta - jñānāḥ [Bg. 7.20 ] , because they have got so strong material desires that they forget Kṛṣṇa . That is harmful. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām [Bg. 7.23 ] . They get some benefit out of the demigod, but that will not stay. Alpavat, er, antavat . Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām . But if you take Kṛṣṇa , then it is not antavat , it will go on increasing. If you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it will never end. It will increase. Ānandāmbudhi- vardhanam , increasing. The ocean does not increase, but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a great ocean that it increases only. Ānandāmbudhi- vardhanam ."
Candanācārya,"Is it not better just to say, ""Kṛṣṇa, whatever You decide. Whatever You give me, that I will accept."" Like Kuntī .",Prabhupāda, Why shall I take from Kṛṣṇa ? You should give.
Candanācārya,"No, I mean. Instead of praying to demigods to give me something, saying, ""Whatever you decide Kṛṣṇa .""",Prabhupāda," Oh yes. No. A devotee never prays to Kṛṣṇa . They have to undergo so much trouble; still they never pray to Kṛṣṇa . They know that ""Kṛṣṇa will give us ultimately protection. Let us do our duty."" Tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇaḥ [ SB 10.14.8] . When a devotee is in difficulty, he is not disturbed. He thinks, It is Kṛṣṇa's wish that I should suffer like like this. It is not suffering; it is my pleasure."" Just like when a patient is undergoing surgical operation, there is pain, but he knows, ""It is better for me."" Therefore agrees, ""Yes sir. You go on with your knife."" So when you are surrendered to Kṛṣṇa , and Kṛṣṇa says that ""I shall give you protection,"" so even in our distressed condition we must know that we are being protected by Kṛṣṇa . We should not be disturbed. Because we create so-called distress and happiness. Actually this world is distress. Here the so-called happiness is also distress. So why a devotee should be disturbed by distressed condition? Harer nāma harer nāma [ Cc. Ādi 17.21 ] . [break]"
Candanācārya,"One time you said that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not difficult, but to remain determined, that is difficult. Determination is difficult.",Prabhupāda," That determination comes by tapasya . Therefore we have got rules and regulation. If you follow the rules and regulation, then you will be determined. Otherwise, you will be victim of māyā . The rules and regulation is there just to keep you fixed up in your determination. But if you don't follow, then you fall down. Just like physician says, ""You don't take this along with medicine. You take this."" That is rules and regulation. If you follow, then you do not become victim of disease again. If you don't follow, then you... What the physician will do?"
Candanācārya; Yaśodānandana,"But it also requires determination to follow the tapasya .; ...you mentioned that the vaiśyas, they are considered to be the capitalists and the śūdras, they are considered to be the Communist. And you mentioned that eventually the communists will take over the capitalists. So how long do you think that will happen?",Prabhupāda," What's the use? Why shall I think like that? Let them go to hell, and let us go back to home, back to Godhead. Why shall I waste our time? We can advise them, ""Do this. You will be happy."" If they do not take, then we don't bother anymore. We are not social welfare worker or political worker. We are worker for Kṛṣṇa . [break] ...in this world that people are suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Let us try to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our only interest. Otherwise we have no interest in this material world. Let them do their own duty and suffer or enjoy. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, samo 'haṁ sarva - bhūteṣu [Bg. 9 .29] . Samaḥ . Samatā . We are not social worker or political worker. We are Kṛṣṇa worker. So we give advice to them that ""You become Kṛṣṇa conscious and all problems will be solved."" That is our duty; and to advise him, to convince him, to give him all facilities. Still, if he does not take, then we are not going to see how long he will suffer, how he will stop. Let them do their own business. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja : [Bg. 18.66 ] ""Give up all nonsense engagement. Just become My devotee,"" we say like that. But if somebody does not give, give up, also not, then Kṛṣṇa also does not interfere. Let him suffer. [break] ...how long one suffers. He can stop his suffering immediately, but if he does not take the medicine, then what can be done? Kṛṣṇa says, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66 ] . If Kṛṣṇa withdraws all his sinful activities, then where is the question of suffering? But he will not do. Now, because he is not surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa , so he is suffering from time immemorial, and nobody can say how long he will suffer. He will go on suffering. It cannot stop. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, mūḍha : ""Rascal."" Na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . He does not know, by simply surrendering to Kṛṣṇa , everything will be nice. That he does not know. And if you advise, he will not accept. matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā . That is explained by Prahlāda Mahārāja , that ""These rascals who have got this idea that 'By adjustment, we shall be happy in this material world,' they will never understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They will never understand because their aim is..."" That picture we gave in Back to Godhead, anchor? Yes. Their anchor is to remain here and enjoy. That is their main disease. They do not... Just like the Russian astronaut has gone so high, he was seeing, ""Where is Moscow?"" The anchor is there in the Moscow. Therefore he has to come down. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad- aṅghrayaḥ [SB 10.2.32 ] . So everyone wants to keep this anchor of this material attachment. They say that ""Yes, I am ready to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness, provided Kṛṣṇa gives us so many material..."" Just like in Germany. So many women went to pray in the Second World War, ""Oh, my husband may come back, my father may come back."" But nobody came back. And all of them became atheists. You see? They take Kṛṣṇa , or God, as their servant, not to become servant of Kṛṣṇa , that ""I prayed so much, 'Kṛṣṇa, God, give us our daily bread.' And He did not give. Therefore give it up."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the Vedic explanation of the working principle of the brain, how our brain is working.",Prabhupāda," Brain is working, because you living entity, soul, is there. Just like I am typing, and he is typing. I have got the latest mechanical, improved typist, and he has got old, bygone age typist, similarly, according to our karma , capacity, Kṛṣṇa gives us facility. So brain is that facility. Kṛṣṇa gives us. Not that... So far the brain substance is concerned, a dog's brain and your Professor Einstein's brain is the same. His brain, same. But because Professor Einstein is advanced in knowledge, he is working differently. Otherwise, when Einstein, the soul is off from the body, and the dog is off from the body, you will see the brain, equally the same. So this, your scientists, they do not know."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : They say that there are about nine billion cells. They are called neurons.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. Just like I have given already. Why nine billion cells are there? Because you can work with it. I have given an electric running on typewriter because I know how to work it. Otherwise, this electric machine and the old electric machine, they are made of the same iron, but if I know how to work it, then I can utilize this machinery. But for a layman, it will be all the same. So that is karma . According to karma , we get a body. The body's machinery is also well-equipped, as I can work. This is nature's gift. Not that ""This brain is first-class, that brain is first-class, er last class."" All brain, last class. It is matter. The man who is working, the soul who is working, he is first-class, second-class, third-class. It is said clearly, īśvaraḥ sarva - bhūtānāṁ hṛd - deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati : [Bg. 18.61 ] ""Īśvara, Kṛṣṇa , is situated in everyone's heart."" Bhrāmayan sarva - bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā : [Bg. 18.61 ] ""He is offered a yantra , a machine, made by material energy."" But that is under the direction of Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa has asked the material energy ""Give a good machine; he can work. Good or bad, as He wants, as He wants. That's all. Give him a..."" yantrārūḍhāni māyayā . It is all bad. Either this electric machine or that manual machine. They are all matter. So anything material, that is bad. But he wants it; ""All right, give it."" That is going on. He wants this facility. Now before these motorcars, people were walking on foot. All business was being done. But we wanted a machine like that, so Kṛṣṇa has given us brain to manufacture. That's all. But what you will benefit by this? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, ""You give up all this nonsense proposal."" But they will not do that. They will create another nonsense desire. That desire should be stopped. That is desireless. Because they will go on simply proposing some nonsense desire... That is their material existence. Now, they have discovered this, made this motor, nice... Now there is problem, no power, gasoline. And if the gasoline is stopped, then your whole endeavor is gone. So this is their business. They are manufacturing something which will entangle him more and more. That he does not know."
GopālaKṛṣṇa,Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : Now they have reduced the output of big cars because previously they were making big cars.,Prabhupāda," Just see. Now how the business will... Another problem. The factory... How will so many men...? So they will create problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, ""You give up all this nonsense desire."""
GopālaKṛṣṇa,Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : The airlines have laid off so many thousands of people because there isn't enough gasoline to fly all the aeroplanes. So they are just laying off people. They are becoming unemployed now.,Prabhupāda," Yes, one after another, problem will come."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Coming to the brain again, the, some people are working. Why some people are insane? For example, the mechanism of working the brain, some of the chemical pathways, they say, change, block. So some people become insane.",Prabhupāda," Insane? Then he cannot work. That's all. Even if I give you good machine... Just like I do not know how to work on it, so similarly, if one does not know how to work, then it is useless machine."
Karandhara,They are thinking that by certain types of chemicals they can correct things like depression and unhappiness. They say it's all just a chemical situation in the brain.,Prabhupāda," But that they propose so many nonsense things, but they cannot do anything."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : They are making experiments on rats now.,Prabhupāda, That's all right. They will go on experimenting life after life. That is their foolishness.
Gurukṛpā,Next life they may have to experiment in a dog's body.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And some of our politicians, he has become a dog. Yes. Nehru. He has become a dog, in Stockholm. Yes."
GopālaKṛṣṇa,"Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : I told that to my mother and she would not believe it. You know, people think that if someone is a great politician or something, he can never become something like this.",Prabhupāda," Then why the politician dies? If he has got so good brain, let him live forever."
GopālaKṛṣṇa,Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : People have so much blind faith in people like Nehru and Gandhi .,Prabhupāda," Jawaharlal Nehru did not want to give up his Prime Ministership unless he was collapsed. So why he did not live if he is so intelligent? And Kṛṣṇa says, if you have to believe Bhagavad- gītā , tathā dehāntara - prāptiḥ [Bg. 2.13 ]. ""He has to accept another body."" So why you should disbelieve that he has accepted a dog's body? Because the acceptance of body is not your business. It is the business of higher nature. Daiva - netreṇa . So if the daiva likes that ""You must take this dog's body,"" how can you refuse it? You cannot refuse."
Devotee,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday in the paper I saw a picture. Nixon had his sixty-first birthday, and he had a big cake made, and he offered the first bite, the first lick to his dog.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is good. That is stated in the Bhagavad... ārto 'rthārthī. He is in great distress. Now he is taking shelter of God. Ārto 'rthārthī. Then he is good at least. Catur - vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. Ārtaḥ. Ārtaḥ means very much distressed. He is very much distressed than all the Americans.
Gurukṛpā,"He had a cake for his sixty-first birthday. He gave the first bite to his dog, d-o-g.",Prabhupāda," Oh, not God?"
Devotees; SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, no, dog. (everyone laughing); Svarūpa Dāmodara : Dog has become his God then.",Prabhupāda," Then why he should not become dog? Become yaṁ yaṁ vāpi ... He has great love for dog, and it is said that yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajati [Bg. 8.6 ] , at the time of death, he will think of dog and he will become dog. This is..."
Yaśodānandana; GopālaKṛṣṇa; Karandhara; Candanācārya,"One time I asked one Indian man, ""Why is it that people beat the dogs in India?"" He says, ""Because the English people were ruling for so long. Now they have taken birth as dogs. We beat them.""; Gopāla Kṛṣṇa : In America taking care of the dogs and cats is a very big business. It's a very big business.; They even have cemeteries.; They buy ten thousand dollar necklace for their dog.",Prabhupāda, Just see how much attracted.
Candanācārya,"Yes, when they die, they leave all their money to the dog.",Prabhupāda, So why they refuse to become a dog? Why they refuse to become a dog?
Karandhara; Umāpati,Some of them would like to become.; Some of them think dogs and cats are more intelligent than people.,Prabhupāda," Intelligent, ant is also intelligent than any human being. So they live within the hole of wall, and there is no scarcity. Can you become like that? You live within your apartment and there is no scarcity. Wherefrom he gets food? They are more intelligent than human being. Everyone has got some specific talent, either human being or cats and dogs or ants, everyone. Just like the vultures, they go four miles, five miles above and they can find out where is a corpse, where is a dead body. But you cannot do that. You see? Immediately pounce on it. Hundreds of vulture will come. Did you not see it? So they are intelligent more than human being. Yes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : That is called acintya . Every living entity has some special quality.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (end)
Nitāi; Satsvarūpa,"Nitāi : January 11, 1974. Morning walk. [break]; ...by reading the books, he'd understood that we should become completely desireless. So he wanted more explanation. And in the car coming out Śrīla Prabhupāda just explained that our desire can't go away because that's the symptom of the living entity. We have to have some desire. But real desirelessness means that you have no more material desire. Material desire: someone is always desiring from God, ""Give me this, give me this."" But when we become purified, then our desire is that ""Kṛṣṇa, please take me. Please take me. Whatever service I can render, please accept it."" But when one has not enough information, then he desires... His idea of desirelessness is to become like a dead stone. Simply to... Because desire causes suffering and it's bad, material desire, therefore let me simply stop it and become... That will be desireless. But that is not, that state is not possible because our symptom of life is to have desire. So we answer him in this way, to become purified and simply serve Kṛṣṇa all the time. Not that we stop any activities. Prabhupāda was saying he is working day and night. So you cannot become absorbed in nothing. In order to become purely desireless, you have to have some activity that will always... There is a place, there is a plane of spiritual desire, spiritual activity. So there's... (pause)",Prabhupāda," What do you have to say about this? Do you understand, desireless and desireful?"
Satsvarūpa,"People some... Pseudo transcendentalists, they sometimes criticize us like that. They say, ""Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, you're just too active."" They're think that we're fruitive, always running around, always trying to sell books, always very active. That's because they don't understand that desirelessness. They talk like that, and then they'll smoke a cigarette the next moment as they criticize us. They say, ""You should not have to do anything if you're transcendental. Why do you have to work so hard?"" And then they'll show that they have some very gross desire. (pause) [break]",Prabhupāda," ...therefore they see that this, their conception of Kṛṣṇa , there is mother, there is father, there is friend—""So what is this? Here also we see the mother, father, friend. So how they become free?"" They cannot understand. Their brain is so poor they cannot understand. Therefore they: ""It is also māyā . To think of Kṛṣṇa , the Supreme, having father, mother, friends, playing pastimes, this is also māyā . "" Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. They cannot conceive that in the spiritual world exactly the same things there are, but the position is different. That is absolute, without any designation."
Candanācārya,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Huh ?
Candanācārya,Also this morning you said that we should try to only love Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Candanācārya,And nothing else.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Candanācārya,"But if we love our godbrothers, is that also loving Kṛṣṇa ?",Prabhupāda," Oh yes. Because they are of, of Kṛṣṇa . What are your godbrothers? They are Kṛṣṇa's servant. So if you do not love your godbrothers, that means you reject your part of Kṛṣṇa ."
Candanācārya,"So also our children, like that?",Prabhupāda, Eh? Eh?
Candanācārya,Also...,Prabhupāda," Yes, if you love children for making them Kṛṣṇa conscious, then it is loving Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa wants sarva - dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja [Bg. 18.66 ] . So if you help... What is our movement? Why I have come to your country? Because to make you Kṛṣṇa conscious. So there is love of Kṛṣṇa . Otherwise why what is the business, I have come to you? I have no business. Because I love Kṛṣṇa , I want to see all, everybody in the world to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise why in this old age we are trying so much? Similarly, if you love your children to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious, then produce hundreds of children and make them. That is love of Kṛṣṇa . And if you make them cats and dogs, then one children producing is also sinful. That is also sinful. But if you can make them Kṛṣṇa conscious, then produce hundreds of children. That is Kṛṣṇa's love. The Bhāgavata says, pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt . ""One should not become father, one should not become mother..."" na mocayed yaḥ samupeta - mṛtyum , ""...if he cannot deliver the children from the imminent hands of death."" That is the condition. So if you cannot make... Death cannot be avoided unless one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious. So if you cannot make your children Kṛṣṇa conscious and stop their death, birth and death process, then don't become a father. This is the injunction. And if you can actually do that, then become father of hundreds children. This is the condition. If you cannot make your children... If you can make, that is love of Kṛṣṇa . Because unless you love Kṛṣṇa , why you should be interested to make others Kṛṣṇa conscious? Let them go to hell. Why you should be so much working hard to make them Kṛṣṇa conscious? Unless you love Kṛṣṇa ? This is the sign of love."" I love Kṛṣṇa , but I do nothing for Kṛṣṇa ."" That is nonsense. That is nonsense. Therefore I said that our Guru Mahārāja's brother, he criticizes Guru Mahārāja . But what he has done for Kṛṣṇa ? And what my Guru Mahārāja has done? Unless my Guru Mahārāja had produced me, how this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is going all over the world? And what he has done? Simply criticizing is no use. We want to see practical. Do you understand or not?"
Candanācārya,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You were also given the equal chance. Prabhupāda, my Guru Mahārāja , sat down at Māyāpura. But you were given the place of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's birth place. What, what you have done? It is still jungle. And what is Māyāpura there? All Americans are building a palatial building. So simply by criticizing, one does not become a very confidential devotee. Where is the action? What he has done? That is required. Phalena paricīyate. [break] ...everything. Unless Kṛṣṇa gives opportunity, nobody can serve Kṛṣṇa also. But he gives opportunity to the proper person. That is everywhere. If you want to become manager of a firm, the proprietor of the firm will see whether you are able to do that. Then he will give the chance. ""Yes."" This is reciprocal. Just like this śloka we were studying today. Kṛṣṇa becomes sārathi . Does Kṛṣṇa go to become sārathi of a rascal and fool? He becomes sārathi of Arjuna . That has to be seen. And without any qualification: ""Kṛṣṇa, become my sārathi . "" Kṛṣṇa's not so easy. First of all qualify. First deserve, then desire. First deserve, then desire. So how a Kṛṣṇa conscious person can be desireless? The first is desire. ""I desire to serve Kṛṣṇa ."" That is the beginning. Then Kṛṣṇa will give you chance as you deserve. This is the process. And that is explained: anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [ Brs. 1.1.11] . When you become completely desireless for anything material, then bhakti begins. That is desirelessness. Desirelessness means when becomes free to desire anything except Kṛṣṇa . That is desirelessness. Desirelessness means not to desire anything material. That is desirelessness. Their Māyāvādī philosophy that ""Everything is māyā , and therefore Kṛṣṇa is māyā . "" That is called Māyāvādī . They do not know the distinction between māyā and reality. Everything māyā . Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs."
Gurukṛpā,Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā .,Prabhupāda," Ah. So Kṛṣṇa is also mithyā . That is their philosophy. And therefore in the Bhāgavata it is beginning: paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi . Satyam , not mithyā . Mithyā you can reject. Unless you find out paraṁ satyam . But that they do not know, what is paraṁ satyam . Therefore Bhāgavata gives: oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya , paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi . (pause) The word is anyābhilāṣitā. Anya - abhilāṣa . Anya means ""other than Kṛṣṇa ."" Anyābhilāṣitā- śūnyam [ Brs. 1.1.11] , being completely freed from any other desires, jñāna -karmādy- anāvṛtam ... [Cc. Madhya 19.167 ]. Jñāna , the jñānīs, they also desiring liberation. The jñānīs, they have got desire. How they are desireless? Because they are aspiring after mukti . The yogis, they are aspiring after siddhi . Karmīs, they are aspiring after better condition of life. So these things should be completely free. Then he's desireless. If you are desiring mukti , where is your desirelessness? Just see. How they are bluffing! They want to become mukta , and still, they say ""desirelessness."" Here is your desire. Just see the defect. Eh? Why you are desiring mukti ?"
Gurukṛpā,"Then they argue that you also want to, you desire to serve Kṛṣṇa .",Prabhupāda," No, therefore I say desirelessness means to desire for Kṛṣṇa . That is desirelessness. Even if you... We are not after mukti . We, we can go to the hell to serve Kṛṣṇa ."
Gurukṛpā,Mama janmani janmanīśvare...,Prabhupāda," Ah! Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahai... [Cc. Antya 20.29 , Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]. That is... There is no question of desirelessness. We desire for Kṛṣṇa . That is desirelessness. Just like a diseased man, if he desires for healthy life, is that bad thing? To desire for further disease, that is desire. That is bad. Therefore I say, you cannot give up desire. That is not possible. You have to purify your desires. But when you desire for Kṛṣṇa , that is desirelessness. To become free from disease, that does not mean you have to stop eating. In the diseased condition, you are eating. As soon as you want to desire, that ""Let me, give me this nice food,"" but you cannot eat on your diseased condition. It will be tasteless. You simply desire, but you cannot enjoy. But same you, man, when the disease is gone, you enjoy that same food very nicely. When you are free from disease, you just ask for rasagullā. You'll taste it. But when you are diseased, the same rasagullā will not be tasteful. That is the condition. The desire which gives you happiness, that is wanted. The desire which gives you distress, that is not wanted. Therefore Bhāgavata begins with dharmaḥ projjhita -kaitavo 'tra: [SB 1.1.2 ] ""The cheating type of religion is rejected."" Because in every religion there is some desire for material objective, up to mukti . Bhukti - mukti - siddhi - kāmī . General people, karmīs, they want pleasure, material pleasure. The jñānīs, they want mukti , and the yogis, they want siddhi . They're everyone beggars. And a bhakta kicks them all out. ""We don't want anything. Simply Kṛṣṇa . That's all."" Therefore he's desireless."
Gurukṛpā,Kṛṣṇa - bhakta — niṣkāma ataeva śānta [Cc. Madhya 19.149 ] .,Prabhupāda," Ah! Ataeva śānta . There is śānti . You have to test whether by, by some desire, whether you have become śānta . That is not possible except Kṛṣṇa . When you serve Kṛṣṇa , then you will feel transcendental pleasure. Otherwise you cannot. Sakali aśānta . For mukti they have to do so many things, so many things. So desireless means to desire for Kṛṣṇa . This is the conclusion. That Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching: mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi . This is desire. ""My life after life simply My devotion unto You may be fixed up."" That's all. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the beginning He says, na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jaga ... [Cc. Antya 20.29 , Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]. ""No, no, no, no,"" not this."" Then there must be some positive. And the positive is: mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi . With simply negative, what you'll do? Simply negative? You must give something positive. Then you'll be satisfied. You are serving somewhere. You don't get sufficient salary. So you desire to give up this, this service. Resignation. But if you don't get any better service, then what will be the result of resignation? You'll starve. Again you'll go, ""Master, I did wrong. Please give me that service."" So that is... The Māyāvādīs' position is like that. They want to become merged into the Supreme. But that is not possible. After some time... āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB 10.2.32 ] . They undergo very good auster..., severe austerities and reach the brahmajyoti, but there, everything being vacant, they cannot remain there. And they have no information of Kṛṣṇa . Therefore they again come down. Patanty adhaḥ . He wants enjoyment, but there is no enjoyment. Simply thinking, ""I am Brahman . "" What is the enjoyment there? You think like a rascal Brahman . Yes, you are Brahman already. Why these sputnik wālās, they go...? (Laughter)"
Devotee,Sputnik wālās.,Prabhupāda," They go very high and again come down? Here is... Why you are coming? You have gone so high. There is no shelter. There is no shelter. He must come down. Similarly, to become desireless, there is no shelter. So you must come to this desire, material desire."
Gurukṛpā,It says in the Brahma - saṁhitā that they may go for the speed of...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Gurukṛpā,"...the mind, but...",Prabhupāda," Panthās tu koṭi - śata - vatsara -saṁpragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso muni -puṅgavānām [Bs. 5.34] . Just like child. We are experiencing. As soon as we finish, cries. And give him something. ""All right."" So there must be something positive. Simply taking away, vacant that will not satisfy. He'll have to cry again, ""Oh, I am vacant. I am vacant."" So Māyāvādīs' position is like that. The karmīs, yogis, jñānīs, all they are fools. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, sarva - dharmān parityajya . [Bg. 18.66 ] ""You rascal, you give up all these karmīs, yogis, jñānī , siddhi ... Kick out."" Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja . This is the instruction. ""Only unto Me. Then you'll be satisfied."" Then the karmīs may say, ""Oh..."" Because he has got idea, without working... Just like all these fools and rascals, they are surprised, ""How these people do not work, and how are happy?"" They cannot imagine that without working hard, one can eat, one can sleep. But when they see that our devotees, they do not work, they are nobody's servant, ""How it is possible?"" They cannot think. They cannot think. But it is possible. Therefore the... When Kṛṣṇa says that mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja , that, the karmīs, jñānīs, they are thinking, ""Then how I will live? If I do not..., simply I become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa , how shall I live?"" So therefore Kṛṣṇa assures: ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva -pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66 ] . ""I shall give you protection."" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. ""You first of all surrender unto Me; Then whatever you want, there will be supply."""
Gurukṛpā,"The karmīs, they are always worried.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Gurukṛpā,They are worried. So Kṛṣṇa ...,Prabhupāda, Karandhara? We made the contract to purchase the Bombay land without money. There was no money at that time. When I signed that contract.
Karandhara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So wherefrom the money came?
Devotees,Kṛṣṇa .,Prabhupāda," And not one rupee, two rupees. Eighteen lakhs of rupees. And when I signed the contract, I had no eighteen hundred. (laughter)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : You have to make... We have to add one zero...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara; Gurukṛpā,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : On the right side. You have to add one zero, so that 18 hundred.; And the time when you signed the contract is the time when Madhudviṣa Swami went to Australia. He did not want to stay in Bombay.",Prabhupāda," No, I asked him that ""Whether you can take charge?"" He refused, ""No, I cannot take charge."" You know that?"
Gurukṛpā,"Yes, I heard.",Prabhupāda," Then Brahmānanda give me assurance. ""I can take charge."" Therefore I signed. But factually, he was as good as Madhudviṣa. (laughs) He made a contract with a, that camp, forty thousand rupees. I settled up for ten thousand rupees. So our work is going on in India and money's spent. Fifty percent is spoiled by this American brain. What can be done? There is no... They'll loot. They cheat. Like anything. Just like this camp. It was, it was Brahmānanda and Madhudviṣa combined together made a contract-forty thousand rupees. Then I said that ""Then I am not going to pay you. You go."" In Kumbha Melā also, the contract was ten thousand. So five thousand already paid. So I said, ""I have no money. You have to become satisfied with the ten thousand."" So they began some trouble, but after all, accepted. Because they make five hundred percent profit."
Gurukṛpā,"As soon as they see American, it becomes twice as much.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. Twice not. Five hundred times. (laughter) As soon as they face: ""They're Americans. They have got money."""
Gurukṛpā,Same thing in market. When they go shopping and...,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Damn cheap."" ""Damn cheap, bābu . "" I have told this story, ""Damn cheap, bābu "" ? Eh?"
Gurukṛpā; Nitāi; Prabhupāda: ; Prajāpati,"No. (end); Nitāi : Morning Walk, January 12th, 1974, Los Angeles. [break]; ...accepting a leader, one has to consider what is the position of the leader. They do not take such account. Now they calculate if the leader is very cunning, then he is qualified. They think that politics means cheating, cunning, bluffing. That is good qualification. Lloyd George, sometimes before he came, he said, ""Consistency in politics is the qualification of an ass."" He must be inconsistent. And here, this is defense. Tasya vartamānasya . How he is situated [break] ...as it was everywhere, especially in India, that if one is not God conscious, he is a third-class rascal. That standard is now gone. Now to become God conscious, to talk of God, is a business of primitive fools. They think like that. Is it not?; Prajāpati : Yes. They say they are realistic and we are not realistic.",Prabhupāda, Who is realistic? The rascals?
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : They think that people who believe in God are not realistic.,Prabhupāda, Oh. And what is the realistic?
Satsvarūpa,To work in social reform or politics is realistic.,Prabhupāda, Reform means that continuously reform? Then where is perfection?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : They have no standard.,Prabhupāda," No standard. What is the standard of reform, that they do not know. Wherefrom the swan came?"
Satsvarūpa; SvarūpaDāmodara,Kṛṣṇa .; Svarūpa Dāmodara : When the facilities are there...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : [break] ...from Rūpānuga Mahārāja stating that six devotees around the country now will be running for political offices, hopefully just to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness into the political arena.",Prabhupāda, He is one of them?
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : No, no. Not Rūpānuga Mahārāja . I am one of them in this area, here.",Prabhupāda, So which post you are going to contest?
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : United States Congress.,Prabhupāda, Oh. Senator?
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Well, congressman. There's two offices of the legislature: the Senate and the House of Representatives. For each state there are two senators, no matter what the population, and for the house of representatives, every so many hundred thousand people, there is one representative.",Prabhupāda," That's like in England, House of Commons. And senator, House of Lords."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Yes, that's right. [break] ...have been projected. One is that we preach very boldly and hold no bars, make it known completely what our platform is. The other attitude is one of making up propaganda more palatable by saying if elected we will reinstitute prayers into schools and not tell them much more than that.",Prabhupāda, Why in the school? In every home.
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Well, it was a very big issue several years ago. They used to have a prayer at the beginning of each school day. But then one demoniac lady, one atheist, she, by her, simply by her will-power got the Supreme Court to rule that unconstitutional. Now prayers are not allowed in schools anymore unless we make an amendment to the constitution, saying ""Yes, we can have a prayer in school."" Then it would be allowed.",Prabhupāda," Even prayers are allowed, unless there is scientific knowledge of God, that will not help. The prayer's still going on in the churches, but what improvement? They have become hackneyed. It requires training."
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Then our political campaign should be educating the people in general as much as possible in the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is taking a chance to educate people.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : We may not be successful in the beginning, but it is a good way of preaching, exposing to the general mass.",Prabhupāda, Yes. [break]
Nara-nārāyaṇa,"Nara - nārāyaṇa : As they elect the congressmen generally to solve different social problems which are existing in the society, so in our campaigning process, should we try to show them practical application of the philosophy for solving all their social problems, or should we preach philosophically?",Prabhupāda," No. We should preach that ""Stop these things. No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating."" Practically you teach them. This is the real social problem."
Umāpati,Should we also try to introduce legislation immediately to close the slaughterhouses?,Prabhupāda," No. If you want good men, good leader, you must be free from all these, I mean, sinful activities. Otherwise there is no question of good leader, or good man. There is no question. First principle is this. Just like a patient, he must abide by the prescription, that ""You must do this, you must do not this."" Then there is cure. And simply if he goes on in his own way, then there is no value of consulting a physician. So the first program is that ""If you want really good leader and if you want to become yourself also good, then you must give up these four sinful activities. Otherwise, all your scheme will be failure."""
Umāpati,So we would tell the people that if we were elected we would try to close the slaughterhouses.,Prabhupāda," No, no, that is different thing. Why you should say, revolting something. You say that ""Don't eat meat."" That is slaughterhouse closing. If you say that ""Close your slaughterhouse,"" they will think that these are, what is called?"
Umāpati,Radical.,Prabhupāda," Ideal, radicalist, idealist. But if you can induce them... That is also another process..."
Umāpati,Through influence.,Prabhupāda," They agree. Then automatically, slaughterhouse will be closed. If there is no customer for meat, then slaughterhouse will be closed. Just like Gandhi started this movement, non-cooperation, ""Don't cooperate with the British government."" That was his... Because the Britishers were ruling India with the cooperation of the Indians. Otherwise, how they could rule? The soldiers were Indian, the police were Indian, the secretariat, office, clerks, they were Indians—all Indians. But they manufactured in such a way that they were cooperating. So Gandhi took the route that ""You non-cooperate; then the Britishers will automatically go away."" That was his movement. Similarly, if we educate public that ""You must find out a leader who is free from these sinful activities. Then you will be happy. And you also give up. Otherwise, how you will be able to select such a leader?"" This should be our real propaganda. Otherwise they will think that ""They're against our real joyful life. So these men are useless."" You have to explain that ""If these things, sinful activities, you prolong, then you cannot become happy."""
Umāpati,"People will ask us, if we get into office. What are we going to do? What is the first thing we are going to do? What can we do? Since there are many, many other legislators and many other senators, they say, ""You are only one man. How you can possibly change the country if we elect you?""",Prabhupāda," That I know. That I know, that I am... Therefore we are, internally, we are not after the office; we are after educating people. Yes. Even if you go to office, you cannot do. Even if give manifesto, that you will stop slaughterhouse, and you are elected a senator, you cannot stop. Because they are majority there. If you say they will laugh, ""What this nonsense saying?"" So even if you give any manifesto, you will not be able to carry out it, because their majority is there. Simply you can general way educate them. Or you can give what is there. There is no harm."
Umāpati,"But there are many people in this country that would like to see prayer put back in schools. Even though they don't understand prayer, at least they like the idea. They are sentimentally attached to it. It was one idea that if we at least say that we would try to get prayer put back in schools...",Prabhupāda," But prayer, without these things, background, there is no value of prayer."
Umāpati,"Yet there are a lot of people who would vote for us on sentiment at least, that at least we are for prayer in schools.",Prabhupāda," Then it is all right. Prayer, to advise people to offer prayer is not bad, but unless one is purified, that will not stay. But prayer, they are still going to church, but still, the churches are being closed."
Umāpati,"Still, that could be influenced in the right direction afterward.",Prabhupāda," Well, influenced, to a certain extent. But as soon as you say, ""prayer to God,"" they will laugh, ""What is this God and prayer?"""
Umāpati,"Well, some people won't. Some people still have at least a sentimental attachment to God, and they would like to see at least a semblance of prayer in school.",Prabhupāda," Do something practical. ""Prayer means to chant the holy name of the Lord. If you have no holy name of the Lord, we are giving you. So you have no expenditure, neither you have any loss. So why don't you try this? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa ."" This will be reasonable. Is it not? And if they actually chant Hare Kṛṣṇa , then automatically the prayer and everything will be done."
Umāpati,"But they still would not be allowed to do it in school. There's a law against that, officially, in school.",Prabhupāda, That you can introduce.
Umāpati,We should try to fight that?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Now in the schools, now the senator have fixed up one date for prayer?"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : Yes, one day.",Prabhupāda," Some 30th or 31st April. So if the government wants prayer, why they have prohibited in the schools? This is contradiction. Point out. This law was introduced due to inexperience. Now they are coming to experience that it has not helped us. Therefore they are introducing prayer. So why don't you take it?"
Umāpati,We should ride with that. We should try to get in on that.,Prabhupāda," Otherwise what is the use of introducing prayer again? They have experienced that this without prayer, things have failed. That's a fact. You take this point."
Umāpati,Yes. The schools are falling apart. Delinquency and there's lots of criminal activity amongst the children in school. And even the teachers are walking out of the classrooms because of the violence in the schools and the lack of communication with their students.,Prabhupāda," No, in India, in examination hall there is regularly police. Regularly. I have seen it. So what is the value of this education? There is regular police. Now there is no ordinary guard."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : In fact some people get killed. During the examination hall, people get killed.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Sometimes people want to copy, and those people who are...",Prabhupāda, Guarding.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Yes. They catch them, and sometimes they get killed outside. Still in Calcutta.",Prabhupāda, Yes. There has been case. Yes.
Umāpati; SvarūpaDāmodara,"In Calcutta that way too?; Svarūpa Dāmodara : Oh yes. I was in the examination hall, and in fact, people are very afraid to be caught there. But now I heard that the government of India is going to change the system of examination.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : That they have introduced a grade system just like here in the United States, and then there will be open books, so that they will be not be afraid of copying things. Open book examination.",Prabhupāda," Oh, common sense. (pause) [break] ...man's aeroplane. Just see. Immediately he goes up. And man's aeroplane, oh, you have to takes position, you have to go so many miles like this. Then you can... It is imitation. The aeroplane has also wings, but his wings is collapsed. But that wing you have to keep. Therefore you require so much space."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Svarūpa Dāmodara : Just like, Śrīla Prabhupāda, a vulture. When the vulture wants to take off, he will run just like an aeroplane for a certain distance. They cannot just get up immediately. Vulture.",Prabhupāda," So you scientists, you are like vultures. (laughter) You have imitated vultures."
Umāpati,"The symbol of the United States is an eagle, which is a bird of prey.",Prabhupāda," No, eagle... Our symbol is also Garuḍa , big eagle. Yes. Big eagle, Garuḍa . And you know Garuḍa is not vegetarian. You know that?"
Prajāpati,Prajāpati : Snakes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He is not vegetarian. So if one becomes a sincere devotee like Garuḍa , you can allow him to become non-vegetarian. If he cannot give it up. [break]"
Nara-nārāyaṇa,Nara - nārāyaṇa : Garuḍa is from the jīva - tattva or he is an expansion?,Prabhupāda," No, he is jīva - tattva . Nitya - siddha ."
Nara-nārāyaṇa,Nara - nārāyaṇa : Does that mean that there is some soul who can come under influence of māyā in the spiritual sky and some soul who cannot?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that potency is there always."
Umāpati,Is that the difference between jīva - tattva and Viṣṇu - tattva .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore Viṣṇu - tattva is called acyuta , infallible. [break]"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : ...from politics to the world of theology. One of the most misunderstood passages in the western scriptures, things that are..., most speculation about, is the beginning of the Book of John, where it is said, ""In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God."" And that Greek word is logos. And so many people have said so many different things about that passage. No one really understands it.",Prabhupāda," They cannot understand the Absolute. God and God's word are not different. Otherwise, why we are after Bhagavad- gītā ? Because Bhagavad- gītā is the words of God. So as good as God."
Umāpati,Absolute?,Prabhupāda," Absolute, yes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Svarūpa Dāmodara : We also say that. We say that the beginning the sound vibration oṁ was there. Oṁ .,Prabhupāda," Yes. Śabdād anāvṛtti. In Vedānta - sūtra , śabdād anāvṛtti. Śabdāt. By vibration."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : But it goes on to say, ""Then the word then came down to earth and dwelt with man as Jesus Christ."" They say Lord Jesus Christ was the word incarnate.",Prabhupāda, That's all right.
Umāpati,"Incarnate means flesh, having come down in flesh.",Prabhupāda, That's all right.
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : From our Kṛṣṇa conscious standpoint, this means a person who is jagad- guru , who is fully living śāstra , and therefore non-different from the word of God?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Because he is following the words of God, therefore he is not different from the words of God. It is practical. Just like a lawyer is not different from the law. Therefore he is called lawyer."
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : But like you were mentioning this morning in class, how they are cheaters. They simply say they are lawyers, but instead they are breaking the law.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Nowadays, big lawyer means who can tactfully break the law. That is good lawyer. They will find out some flaw in the law and win the case. A man has committed murder, everyone knows, and if a lawyer can save him, then he is a good lawyer. How to nullify the law, he is a good lawyer."
Umāpati,We find that our administration and our government is composed of about fifty or sixty per cent lawyers.,Prabhupāda, Like Nixon.
Umāpati,Yes. Pretty much so like Nixon.,Prabhupāda, What is the position of Nixon now?
Umāpati,He's getting more popular.,Prabhupāda, How?
Umāpati,"Well, he couldn't get any less popular. So now nothing's happened. So he is the only one available. So he is getting more popular. People forget.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : They are all cheaters. So because he is a cheater, they feel he is one of them.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,That's called representation.,Prabhupāda," Yes. People have become cheaters. Therefore their representative is also cheater. You can make vigorous propaganda that ""This will not help without prayer, offering prayer to Lord. You shall stopped; it is not good. And prayer means you chant the name of God. So there is no loss on your part. If there is some gain, why don't you try it?"" It will be very nice, beneficial."
Umāpati,They have nothing more to lose.,Prabhupāda," ""But if you chant, you will be gainer. So... And what is the harm? You chant and see the result."""
Umāpati,But they must follow the four regulative principles too.,Prabhupāda," You can advise. Even they do not follow, they will later on follow, by chanting. Yes."
Nara-nārāyaṇa,"Nara - nārāyaṇa : At our Sunday program, generally, the guests do not follow the four regulative principles, but when they come, they become very blissful.",Prabhupāda," But one thing. When you make your propaganda, you must have the facility for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa . Or you are simply going to speak? No chanting?"
Prajāpati,"Prajāpati : No, we'll always have chanting. We will not speak without first chanting.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,But still we have to talk to them.,Prabhupāda," No, you can talk. But first of all chanting. And request them to join the chanting."
Umāpati,"We will probably become known as the Hare Kṛṣṇa party, just like we became known as the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. (end)",Prabhupāda, ...one poster [break]

Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam , tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1]. Whatever is Kṛṣṇa's property, you can... You are Kṛṣṇa's son; you can utilize it. But one son is prohibiting, ""No, no, you cannot enter here."" This is the problem. The so-called nationalism is dangerous. Just see how nice flowers, fruits, plant. Everything is there, complete."
Sudāmā,Yes. Jayaśrī is here also.,Prabhupāda, Oh. ( japa ) Thank you. Jayaśrī joined when I first came here?

But you'll find so much water. How the water is transferred there? What is their explanation? They'll use simply some bogus jugglery of words. That's all. But produce it, without pipe, without pump.

BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : They say it is an accident, that the world is going to the...",Prabhupāda," They are rascals. Therefore I always say, ""Kick them on their face with your shoes, so-called scientists."" ""Accident."" There is no question of accident. Mūḍha . Therefore they have been described in the Bhagavad- gītā as mūḍhāḥ , rascals, narādhama. Narādhama, the lowest of the mankind. Because they got this opportunity to appreciate the work of Kṛṣṇa , but they avoid it, they are narādhama. No, they are so big, big graduate, scientists, and..."" māyayāpahṛta- jñānāḥ [Bg. 7.15 ] . Their real knowledge is taken away, simply childish proposing something, so-called scientists. Real knowledge is to see everywhere Kṛṣṇa , mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa - carācaram [Bg. 9.10 ]. The supervision of Kṛṣṇa . That is real knowledge. Not only to appreciate, but to explain it also. Kaniṣṭha - adhikārī will appreciate, but cannot explain how it is being done. Madhyama - adhikārī will explain. That is preacher. And uttama - adhikārī , he thinks that everyone knows, everyone knows. He does not see that somebody knows, somebody does not know. He sees everyone knows. That is uttama - adhikārī . He does not make any distinction."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : He does not preach.,Prabhupāda," Eh? No. He's paramahaṁsa . Does not preach means he preaches, but he comes to the second-class platform. The first-class platform means he does not make any distinction between devotee and nondevotee. He sees everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service."
BaliMardana,Bali Mardana : Does he consciously come from the first-class to second-class.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Just like Jesus Christ says that there was many things to be said by, by..."
BaliMardana,"Bali Mardana : ""There are many things, but I can, but you cannot, I have to tell you, but you cannot bear them now.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, so that means he's first-class, but he comes to the second-class platform or third-class platform to teach the third-class, second-class person. He's first class. Son of God cannot be second-class or third-class. He must be first-class. But... Just like Lord Buddha . He's God Himself, but He said nothing about God because he knew that ""These rascals, they will not be able to... Let them stop meat-eating, that's all. Let them become sinless first of all; then they will be able..."" So his main preaching was ahiṁsā , non-violence, no meat-eating. But still, they violate that. Jesus Christ also preached, ""Thou shall not kill,"" but these rascals, all violating. And still, they are proclaiming as Christian and Buddhist. No religion will, real religion, will allow this kind of violence, no religion. It is cheating religion. Dharmaḥ kaitavaḥ : Any religion committing unnecessary violence to the animals, (it is) third-class. It is not religion, it is cheating. Simply cheating."
Sudāmā,They believe it's very necessary.,Prabhupāda," They believe because they're rascals. Why necessary? We are not meat-eaters, why it is necessary? You have created necessary. Tongue. Tār madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati: ""The tongue is very greedy and it does not satisfy."" Therefore they create their necessity. Civilized human, how they can eat meat?
