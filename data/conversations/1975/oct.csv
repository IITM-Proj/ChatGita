Brahmānanda,...possible to be a scientist and also be God conscious. Why not use science...,Prabhupāda, That is real scientist. These are false scientists.
Cyavana,"...lization, they feel that they need science. They've become dependent upon science. They feel that without science they cannot live.",Prabhupāda, Why?
Cyavana,The scientists have made them dependent.,Prabhupāda," That is their foolishness. These rascals are fools. Therefore they have become dependent. Why science? What for? That is not... Science is required,vijñāna.That is nice. But they are not scientists."
Cyavana,"We ask them if they need eternal life. They say ""No, we don't need that. We need comforts.""",Prabhupāda, They... We are eternal.
Cyavana,"That ""We need our daily bread,"" like that.",Prabhupāda," Where is comfort? You are going to die. Where is your comfort? You are going to be diseased. You are going to be old man like me. Every moment there is some trouble. So where is the comfort, rascal? That means misleading. There is no comfort; still, they are promising comfort. This is misleading. Where is comfort? Eh?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,There is no comfort.,Prabhupāda," Huh? Where is comfort? If you have to die—""Oh, I am dying comfortably""—what is this nonsense? ""I am dying comfortably."""
Indian devotee man (1),"Like yesterday night, that man. I asked him, (Hindi) So he said that ""I am all right."" But he was unable to sit on the chair.",Prabhupāda, So which way?
Cyavana,"To the park, straight.",Prabhupāda," Comfort, where is your comfort? Why you have so many medical men if you are comfortable? Why there are so many drugs, medicine, if you are comfortable? This ismāyā.He is not in comfort; still, he will say that ""I am in comfort."" This is calledmāyā,illusion."
Brahmānanda,"So these drugs, even though one may be feeling pain, he can take the drugs and he won't feel pain.",Prabhupāda," Yes. He will take injection. It is comfort. Daily he will take injection, and it is comfort. (laughter) Just see the fools and rascals.Mūḍha.[break] ...met so many medical men, doctors and quack. ""Die comfortably."" What is the use of this medical man, medicine? What is the use? If your comfort and death is comfortable, then why spend so much money? Die comfortably. Because you cannot check death, then why you are trying to check death? ""Let me live some years more. Let me take this medicine."" Why? Why this struggle? Die comfortably. Suffer disease comfortably."
Cyavana,They've made so much propaganda that life is meant to enjoy. Everywhere...,Prabhupāda," Enjoy, but where is your enjoyment? Come to the practical point. Where is your enjoyment? You are simply suffering. That is their rascaldom. They are suffering; still, they say, ""I am enjoying."" This is called illusion,māyā.Enjoy. That we also say, that we are trying to take you to a certain place, kingdom of God or back..., where you will enjoy. Enjoy...Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12).That enjoy is our aim. But where is your enjoyment here? That is your rascaldom. There is no enjoyment; still, you say, ""We shall enjoy."""
Cyavana,Their propaganda leads people to think that they can enjoy... That it's possible here.,Prabhupāda," They're misleading. That is misleading. We have to check that. That is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness move..., that... They are not enjoying, and these rascals misleading them that they are enjoying. [break] Enjoyment is our aim also—but real enjoyment.Ramanteyogino 'nante satyānande. Satyānanda.Not thisānanda,temporaryānanda."
Cyavana,Eternal.,Prabhupāda," Satyānanda-cid-ātmani.Yogis,bhakti-yogis,they also wantānanda,but not this falseānanda, satyānanda-cid-ātmāni,iti...Therefore they callRāma.Rāmameansramaṇa,enjoyment.Itirāma-padenāsauparaṁbrahmābhidhiyate[Cc.Madhya9.29].They do not know what issatyānanda.They do not understand, as soon as we accept this material body, it is misery, simply misery. The body is constructed within the womb of the mother in a miserable condition. These rascals, they do not understand. In a packed-up way, head down, leg up. And it is enjoyment. The body is created in this troublesome, from miserable condition; still, they say, ""enjoyment."" This is foolishness. This is called illusion."
Brahmānanda,"Sigmund Freud, his philosophy is that that position in the womb was one of great security, and we all want to go back to that position.",Prabhupāda," Where is security? The mother is killing them, abortion. Where is security? The mother, under whose abdomen I have taken shelter, she is killing. Where is security?"
Indian man (1),"OneĀrya-samājīin Nairobi, he was saying that the body is only made in three months, not in seven months in the abdomen of a mother.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Indian man (1),He said the body only...,Prabhupāda, The body is made in one night.
Indian man (1),He said that...,Prabhupāda," No, he said. What he is? Body is made, one night, immediately. After sex it becomes emulsified, two secretion, and immediately a pealike form is there. That is body. And that grows."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Although everyone is suffering, however, they think that ""Because I am not suffering, everyone else is suffering, and that's okay."" They're thinking that the miseries are only for others.",Prabhupāda," That is another ignorance. Everyone is dying. He is thinking, ""I will not die."" This is ignorance. He is running so fast unnecessarily."
Cyavana,He is trying to enjoy that machine.,Prabhupāda," Enjoy means another machine willstrike, and his enjoyment will stop. There is ship, going fast. Where he will go fast?"
Brahmānanda,Around the island.,Prabhupāda," Just like the dog. He goes fast here and there.""Gow! Gow!""(laughter) It is like that. He is going fast. Doggish mentality. That's all, all dogs and cats, no human being. This civilization means they are creating only dogs and cats, animals,go-kharaḥ,cows and asses. They are... We don't take them as human being. All animals."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is that because they don't acknowledge that they're suffering?,Prabhupāda, So many things. So many things. The first ignorance is that accepting this body as self. Everyone.
Cyavana,The capitalists are so anxious for money that they exploit this tendency of the living entity to enjoy by tempting him. Every year they create some new way to entice him.,Prabhupāda," And taxation. And the taxation is divided among them. The tax is meant for public welfare. Instead of public welfare, they divide it amongst themselves and enjoy wine, women, motorcar and flesh. That's all. This is going on. All this income tax-plundering process. This income tax means a plan how to take away everything from the actually earning members of the society. That is income tax. And that is divided amongst administrators. That's all."
Cyavana,"Here it is very prominent. The workers in the fields, they are barely making enough to live from day to day. But the planters who live in France, they are taking millions of rupees and living very comfortably.",Prabhupāda, Therefore Communism is coming. Go this way?
Cyavana,Is it this way? We can go this way. This way. Or better this way. Now he's coming the other way.,Prabhupāda," [break] ...create another danger. Just like airplane. It is comfortable. You can quickly go from one place to another. But as soon as on the plane, immediately your life is at risk. There is no certainty. So this is the way of material world. You create some comfort and you create some greater danger also. Side by side. It cannot be unhampered comfort. That is not possible. You create a motorcar—the same thing—you drive very speedy and you meet accident. Railway, the accident. There was no need. You produce your food locally and produce your milk. Then eat, drink, and live comfortably. ChantHareKṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Make your life successful.Yaduttama-śloka-guṇānuvarṇanam[SB1.5.22].And if you have got education, then describe the glories of the Lord by your scientific and educational qualification.

Brahmānanda,"In theBiblethere are so many things that were... about the world that were mistakes, and then, by their scientific knowledge, they found the real fact. Like they say the earth was flat...",Prabhupāda," Biblemay be wrong, but we are talking generally. So if you are scientist, you can say the right thing. But why should you deny God?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, if the book of God has made mistake, then we don't have any faith...",Prabhupāda," Book of God... Then throw it. Kick it out. But I say that you are scientist. How you can deny God? That is our propaganda. The so-called book of God, you throw away. But you are scientist. How can you deny the existence of God? Why you are misleading?Biblemisleading, that's all right. Why you are misleading? That is our point."
Cyavana,For so many centuries they took theBibleto be the authority.,Prabhupāda," All right, throw it away. You are scientist."
Cyavana,They won't.,Prabhupāda," You are a scientist. How you can deny God? Then what kind of scientist you are? TheBiblehas done wrong. Throw it away. I have no objection. But you are scientist. How you can deny God? And that is our point. Come to this logic, that ""How we can deny God?"" You are speaking that from chemical combination life is formed. Do it in the laboratory. You cannot do it. Why you are propagating false propaganda? What kind of scientist? Then you are also to be kicked out. IfBibleis to be kicked out you are also to be kicked out. Why you are claiming your position? You prove first of all. You combine chemical and produce a life. And you are making false propaganda, so you are to be kicked out. They say, ""We shall do in future."" And what is the future? Then why you are at present making false propaganda. Wait for the future. Post-dated check. ""In future I shall pay."" Who will accept this check? Any nonsense will accept."
Brahmānanda,But this world is so imperfect...,Prabhupāda, The world is not imperfect; you are imperfect rascal. You are rascal; you are imperfect. World is not imperfect.
Brahmānanda,"Well, they have these cyclones. They come...",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. Must come because you are to be killed. You are rascal; you are to be killed. Therefore God has created cyclone. You protect yourself if you are scientist, if you have got power."
Cyavana,Because they are anxious for some...,Prabhupāda," Because God has created cyclone, therefore He is perfect because you are to be killed, blown away with your all paraphernalia, with your all scientific laboratory and instrument. Go. Go to hell. That is perfection."
Cyavana,They are eager to find a solution. Therefore they are forced to speculate because they have no other way...,Prabhupāda, No other way.
Cyavana,"They have no other way to learn, unless they will acceptVeda,which they won't accept. [break] ...sense gratification. They enjoy making so many theories.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes.Mano-ratha:""Chariot of mind."""
Cyavana,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Mano-rathenāsati dhāvatobahiḥ.By his chariot of the mind he will be driven to this material consciousness. [break] ...spiritual knowledge. Therefore, we see, big, big scientists, they are thinking that combination of matter can produce life. In spite of so much advanced learning, they do not know what is life. They cannot create life; still, they will theorize. How foolish they are. And as soon as you catch his throat, ""Produce life."" ""No, we shall do it in future."" Just see."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Sometimes people ask that ""If God is so great, then why doesn't He just come and destroy all the evil?""",Prabhupāda, Because you have to suffer. You are rascal. You must suffer. Therefore evil must be there.
Brahmānanda,Why doesn't He force us to be good?,Prabhupāda," Just like if the criminals and thieves say, ""Why government has created this prisonhouse?"" Is it very good argument? It is for you, rascal. You are criminal. You must suffer. Why it is to be abolished? Otherwise who will suffer? It is for your suffering."
Brahmānanda,Why are we evil? Why doesn't God makes us good?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Brahmānanda,Why are we evil?,Prabhupāda," No, God says that ""You become devotee of Me."" You do not become. That is your fault. Therefore you must... Just like government does not say that you become criminal. Government says, ""You become educated. You become high-court judge, become big officer."" Why you become criminal, pickpocket? Does government give any education for becoming pickpocket? Hm? Is there any institution how to steal, how to become pickpocket? (laughter) Then why do you become? Just see. [break] ...eatables you can collect, and I shall show you how to cook in the cooker. One boy. You also see, because nobody will go there."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Harikeśais getting hisvisatoday.,Prabhupāda, So we can return. [break] Whole educational system is defective because there is no spiritual education. That has made everything impossible.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"One young boy in Johannesburg wanted to join us. He is sixteen years old. So his headmaster said, ""What you will do without an education?"" They think that this is the greatest ignorance. These are the leaders of education, the headmaster. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...spiritual education, he remains an animal. That's all. [break] That isVedānta-sūtra,athātobrahmajijñāsā.To find out the ultimate goal, that is education.Janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1],""Wherefrom everything is coming,"" that is education."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But they may say, ""That is not practical, because we will starve to death with such knowledge.""",Prabhupāda," Then... Then you are useless. Because you cannot go to the ultimate point of education, therefore your education is useless."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But then they will ask, ""You will come and bring me food?""",Prabhupāda," Yes, I will give you food. Food is there. You are not creating food. It is... From the earth it is grown."
Brahmānanda,But we have to work very hard; otherwise we won't get money for buying food.,Prabhupāda, No. You work a very slight three months in a year and get all food. Food is there; milk is there; land is there. You have to work.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is it possible to take the mass of crowlike people and give them the higher taste?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is it possible to take a mass of crowlike people and elevate them?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Human beings, after all, they are. They can be educated. That is the opportunity of human life, that he can be educated. The cats and dogs cannot. [break]"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,Wake up in the morning and get drunk.; They're watching. [break],Prabhupāda," ...prominent. Red, yellow, and blue."
Indian man (1); Cyavana,Blue.; Violet is there.,Prabhupāda," No. The mix, you make a hundred color, but three colors are prominent. Then you mix. You mix the green and yellow..., er, blue and yellow; it become green. You mix the red and yellow; it will become orange. You mix the blue and red; it become violet. Like that. Originally three colors."
Brahmānanda,They say from those three colors they can make actually thousands of different colors.,Prabhupāda," Therefore three modes of material nature by mixture-8,400,000's of species of life, by different mixture. And when you come to the original color, then thebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya...And then you transcend the color; you come to the spiritual life. [break]"
Bhārgava,"...prison. And then when he gets out of prison he has the memory of his punishment, and that acts as a deterrent to him committing the crime again. But if someone is sinful... [break]",Prabhupāda," It istamo-guṇa.He knows everything; still, he is forced to act criminally. That istamo-guṇa.Everyone knows that he will be punished. He has seen that criminal is punished. Still, he acts criminally. That is called ignorance. Heart is unclean. Therefore our first process isceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12],to cleanse the heart."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Pāpa-buddhi,sinful intelligence.",Prabhupāda," To cleanse the heart, beginning of cleanse the heart, that everyone is cats and dogs and so-called human beings... They are under the bodily concept of life. It has to be cleansed, that ""You are not this body."" If he understands that, then he will understand other things. This is the beginning of knowledge. But where is that knowledge? No school, no college, teaches this thing. So they remain in ignorance. What is this education if he remains in ignorance? [break] ...kinds of advertisement."
Cyavana,That is their propaganda. [break],Prabhupāda," There was no... We don't require all these things because we know others are victims. They pay for it. And they work hard for the money and pay to work. That's all. Our men never touch this Coca-cola and cigarette, but others, they aremadafter it."
Brahmānanda,"They say they have to work so hard to get food, but actually they are working hard for this.",Prabhupāda," He'll get food. Food they can grow very easily, but they...Anartha.This is calledanartha.Anarthameans unnecessarily.Ādau śraddhtatasādhu-saṅgo 'thabhajana-kriy tato 'nartha-nivṛttisyāt.Soanartha-nivṛtticivilization, notanarthaincreasing.

But they will eat them, and they will create these motor big, big buses and then petrol, then fight. (baby birds making sounds.)"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,They also want to join thesaṅkīrtanamovement.,Prabhupāda," They are dependent on mother, by nature dependent. Similarly, you should be dependent on the original source of emanation. This is nature. Why they are with the mother?"
Cyavana,Without the mother they cannot survive.,Prabhupāda," No, without, they can survive; still, they are dependent."
Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,"They have to be taught how to live by the mother.; They feel protected with the mother. Safe. People sometimes argue that God is for less intelligent, weak persons.; People who can't protect themselves, for people who cannot protect themselves, then they can have belief...",Prabhupāda, Then you can protect from death? Can you?
Brahmānanda,"But can God protect? Even Jesus Christ, he was killed.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. We are faulty. But you are so advanced. Do you protect yourself from death? We are faulty. That is your decision. That we admit. But what is your position? Protect yourself from death. At any moment death can take place. How you'll protect yourself? Therefore we take protection of God. That ""God, You can kill me at any moment. You can save me also."" Therefore we are intelligent. But you cannot protect from the onslaught of God. We admit God is great, but you do not, although you will not be protected. You cannot protect yourself from birth, death, old age and disease. So what is the meaning of your protection?"
Brahmānanda,"So both the devotee and the nondevotee, they are both in the same position. They both...",Prabhupāda," They... And the devotees know that we are under the control of the Supreme, but you do not know. You are cats and dogs, and the dogs do not know, the cats do not know, you do not know. Therefore you are no better than the cats and dogs. And we know that there is God; there is controller. Therefore we are not cats and dogs. We are equal to the cats and dogs. You do not know; therefore you remain cats and dogs. We know."
Brahmānanda,What is the harm of being a cat or a dog?,Prabhupāda," That is later on. First of all you do not know; we know. That is the difference. If somebody knows there is government, he is better than the outlaws who don't, doesn't care for the government. He is better position, a good citizen. Who accepts that there is government is good citizen. And one who doesn't care for the government, does whimsically everything, he becomes criminal. And then he is punished. That is the difference."
Brahmānanda,So if we all became devotees there would be no punishment.,Prabhupāda," No. He'll be protected.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66]."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,You've given the example that theratin the mouth of the cat and the kitten in the mouth of the cat is two different things. [break],Prabhupāda, ...side.
Cyavana; Devotee (2),"From the hills, from these mountains. There are lakes and reservoirs and it comes down. There's a lot of rainfall on certain parts of the island all year.; Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were speaking ofanarthasand one of the lesser age boys was wondering... He's asking why we shouldn't take tea.",Prabhupāda," Because intoxication. You become addicted. You are asking because you cannot give up tea. Therefore you are asking. Therefore it should be given up. You become servant of tea. Otherwise there is no question of asking. His asking means you want to drink. That means he has become servant of tea. Our original position—we are servant of God. So we are going to be servant of God. So if we remain servant of this material world, we cannot become servant of God. [break] ...unnecessary are advertised and people become victimized."
Indian; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"We are putting our posters here all round and they down immediately. Simply they want advertisement of this. [break]; ...because they are envious.

Then unnecessarily producing so much sugarcane. And the by-product of sugarcane, molasses, you'll have to utilize. Then produce wine, liquor. One after another."
Indian man (3),But our country depends upon sugar.,Prabhupāda," No, that is mistake. Your country, you can produce your own food. That's all. Why you should depend? You produce food grains. You produce milk. Then your all necessities is supplied. Why should you produce unnecessarily?"
Brahmānanda,Here they use powdered milk because they have no cows.,Prabhupāda," Just see. And here even by this sugarcane, what is called? Upper part? This part?"
Indian man (1),We call itag.(?),Prabhupāda," Ag,yes. You can maintain thousand of cows."
Indian man (1),"But that's actually best food, you know. In Punjab they use that. They store it for a year.",Prabhupāda, But you do not know how to be happy.
Indian man (1),"Even this land, here they are producing sugarcane. So that is strong for wheat. They can grow plenty of wheat.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Everything can be grown."
Cyavana; Indian man (1),"If sugarcane will grow, anything will grow. It's very fertile.; Because they don't want to do anything, they simply plant the sugarcane and then they want rest for few months, simply getting money and taking and drinking.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Indian man (1),No work. [break],Prabhupāda," ...getting rice, wheat from outside, they can charge any price because the price of grain is increasing."
Indian man (1),"Any time, they can stop it.",Prabhupāda, You can stop it. (end)
Guest (1) (Indian man),Are you striving for peace in the world? Is it one of your goals?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everyone is trying for peace in the world. I have already referred to the United Nations organization. They are also trying peace of the world. But one must know the right way how to bring peace in the world. So our proposition is that if you keep the human being as good as animal, then how there can be peace? There cannot be any peace among animal society. (aside:)Aiye.Let him...Jaya.This is our proposal. So we are bringing these Europeans, Americans, Africans, Canadians, Australians to this platform of understanding, that ""We are human being; we are not animals."" The... First I have already explained. So long we shall remain in the bodily concept of life, then we remain animal."
Guest (2) (Indian man),What was the necessity of creating thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement?,Prabhupāda," Necessity is that the human form of life is meant for advanced education. Unfortunately, they are being educated to live like animals. That is the mistake. So we want to correct this mistake."
Guest (2),"But the spiritual organizations in India, all the spiritual teachings in India, have always put great emphasis on the fact that we are spiritual beings. So what was the necessity of creating another movement to say the same things?",Prabhupāda," No. We are... You have brought in the question of India. We are talking of the human society, so why you are bringing India? We are not talking about India only. Human being does not mean only Indian. You see, human being—all, outside India, inside India, everywhere. Wherever there is human being, they require this education. And it is the India's duty. Because India has got the opportunity to be spiritually advanced by the grace of learned, saintly persons, so they should first of all make their life perfect by taking education and distribute the knowledge throughout the whole world. That is India's mission. That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mission, that... The exact word is"
Guest (2),Have you had a significant impact on the American society?,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Brahmānanda; Guest (2); Brahmānanda; Guest (2); Brahmānanda,"What is that?; Have you had a significant impact on the American society? The values you preach, have they influenced Americans to a certain degree?; Oh, yes. You can go in America, any country, any city, and everyone will knowHareKṛṣṇa.; That's not what I mean. What I mean is have Americans started to be less violent, for instance, or have they started to be less egotistical or...; Well, not unless they follow our movement. But those who have followed our movement... Recently there was one study that was published by a very eminent sociologist in America from the University of California, the (sic:) Union Theological Center, and he stated in that book that the members of this movement, formerly they were drug-addicted hippies, and now they have become servants ofKṛṣṇaand humanity, loving servants. So he has given proof through intensive interviews that one who follows and joins this movement, dramatically his life becomes changed.",Prabhupāda," Perfect. He is a big professor, and his books are being sold in higher circles. Professor Judah. And he has studied this movement for five years. And... You have got that book?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Show him. So they are appreciating. Appreciation has begun. Formerly they thought it is another edition of hippie movement, but now they are realizing it is not. A cultural. He has given the name of the book,HareKṛṣṇaand Counterculture.He is selling at the cost of twelve dollars; still, all high class, educated class, are purchasing."
Guest (3) (Indian man),Have you any program for the common people?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Common people have joined. Everyone. We are opening centers so that any common man from anycaste, any creed, any nation, they can come and join."
Guest (2),"My friend, perhaps you would like to do... I know you are doing some social work for...",Prabhupāda," This is the best social work. We are making animal into man. Already I have begun this, that because they are not educated how to become human being, so they remain animals. So this is the best social work, that we are bringing animals, two-legged animals, to real human being. If a human being is not properly educated, he remains an animal. So this is the proper education. Therefore we are bringing animals to human being."
Guest (3),Has your movement arranged once any particular event which is a movement in a particular country?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. When we are many in number, then we shall take politics also. Yes. First of all let there be perfect men. If there is no perfect men, the government will be imperfect. If there is perfect men, the government will be perfect."
Guest (4) (Indian man),"Do you think, Swamiji, that man can become perfect?",Prabhupāda," That is the chance of a human being. Therefore in the human society there is school, college, education, culture, not in the animal society, because they can be made into perfect, not the animals. So if they are denied proper education, that is the greatest harm. They got the opportunity, and the authorities are not giving them their opportunity."
Guest (4),"No, but do you mean the perfectness is to become God or to become the man? Then I want...",Prabhupāda, You never become God.
Guest (4),What does perfectness mean?,Prabhupāda, Perfect means to become godly.
Guest (1),Can you be interested directly in politics?,Prabhupāda," Why not?Kṛṣṇa...Kṛṣṇawas in politics. So He instructedArjunato fight. This is politic—for a good cause. WhenArjunadenied that ""Kṛṣṇa, I am not willing to kill my, the other side, my brothers and my uncles,"" He chastised him thatkutastvākaśmalamidaṁviṣamesamupasthitam:""How you are talking like non-Aryan? What is this nonsense?"" He...Kutastvā.First of all... Find out."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Chapter Two,Bhagavad-gītā,text two:",Prabhupāda, And purport?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Purport. ""Kṛṣṇa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore LordKṛṣṇais referred to asBhagavānthroughout theGītā.Bhagavānis the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namelyBrahman, or the impersonal, all-pervasive spirit;Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; andBhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, LordKṛṣṇa. In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:",Prabhupāda, So this movement is to make the people Aryan.
Guest (2),"Telling... (microphone moving) Let's say, people who fight for their rights, the blacks in the United States or...",Prabhupāda," ...for thekṣatriya?Kṣatriyameans one who gives protection from being hurt,kṣat. Kṣatmeans hurting. So suppose if I unnecessarily hurt you, then it is the duty of the government to give you protection. So unless I am also punished by violence, I cannot..., He cannot give you protection. So this is also necessary. Therefore in the society there must bekṣatriya.Thebrāhmaṇasshould be learned; they should give instruction, advice. Thekṣatriyasshould give protection; thevaiśyasshould produce, economic development; and rest, they should assist-śūdras,that's all. This is the program of Aryan society."
Guest (5) (Indian man); Brahmānanda; Guest (5); Brahmānanda; Guest (1); Brahmānanda,How long do you expect to stay in Mauritius?; Prabhupāda is leaving Sunday for Durban and Johannesburg.; And the others?; They will stay here. We're making a center here.; Have you any program of Swamiji for the common mass?; Here in the evenings.,Prabhupāda," Actually I want to speak only to the intelligent... [break] ...the common mass, they will not understand. But we can performkīrtanafor the common men, so that they may be purified."
Guest (1),Excuse me. I mean in your presence there must be some program likekīrtanaor...,Prabhupāda," Anyway, this idea of society, of your culture, general mass of people, especially nowadays, it is very difficult. So if the leaders understand-yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhaḥ[Bg.3.21]—then the common mass will follow."
Guest (3),"Yes, but here in Mauritius, most of the people are of Indian origin. It is easy for them to understandKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda," Therefore I say the Indian, the leading Indians here, if they make a program, the common will follow. And everything is described in theBhagavad-gītā,how society should be conducted."
Guest (3),"But I think, Swamiji, common men follow only swamis, not the leaders or the priests.",Prabhupāda," The idea is: the common men, they expect something, especially Indians, that India has got some spiritual culture. So every human being is seeking after spiritual culture, but unfortunately, at the present moment they are doing something which is not very desirable, the so-called swamis and yogis. I do not wish to describe them."
Guest (2); Brahmānanda,"Does your haircut have any particular significance?; The shaving of the head is a sign of surrender to the spiritual master, and we leave theśikhā...",Prabhupāda," And keep the head light instead of unnecessarily burdened. In theKali-yugathere is a symptom. It is stated in the...Lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam:""In theKali-yugapeople will think by keeping long hairs he has become beautiful."" This is the mentality of this age.Lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam.You can write this.Lāvaṇyammeans luster, andkeśa-dhāraṇammeans keeping hair."
Guest (3),By preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness would you condemn other people's beliefs?,Prabhupāda, We must condemn anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious. We say... I don't condemn;Kṛṣṇacondemns.
Guest (3),"No, suppose someone follower of... (loud static)",Prabhupāda, But he does not know who is the Supreme God.
Guest (3),"But Swamiji, Indian culture, although is (Hindi). Then why you are telling a king...",Prabhupāda," Indian culture is given (Hindi), that to allow them to worship the demigods means at least to accept the authority, and then they gradually come to the supreme authority. Just like for the common man, to give respect to the police constable means giving respect to the government. But the police constable is not the president of the government. So one should know who is the president. That is advancement. If you remain, simply offering respect to the constable, that is not advancement."
Guest (4),Indian philosophy has always taught that light comes from many lamps. But you are preaching that...,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Brahmānanda; Guest (4),He says Indian culture has always taught that light comes from many lamps.; But you are preaching... (loud static),Prabhupāda," Yes. That is the supreme light. There are degrees of light. There is sunlight, and there is this light. You cannot compare this light with sun. (laughter) Light are so many, but that does not mean the sunlight and this light is the same."
Guest (4),"No, what I...",Prabhupāda, First of all you understand this. You have questioned about the light. First of all you understand there are degrees of light. You cannot say this light and the sunlight is the same.
Guest (4),"By this, you mean that those who adopt the teachings coming from the Koran or from the Bible is lesser light than from theGītā?",Prabhupāda," That is your business. That is your business. But we give you the idea that light comes from everywhere. There is one glowworm. That light also light, and the sunlight is also light. You cannot think that the glowworm's light and the sunlight is the same. Now it is your business to see which is glowworm light and which is sunlight. That is your business."
Guest (6) (Indian man); Brahmānanda,It has been eloquently argued particularly in Third World countries that your movement is under the wing of a certain imperialist countries. Do you...?; He said that there is some allegation that our movement is connected with certain imperialistic countries.,Prabhupāda," Let them say all nonsense. What can I do? Every nonsense will speak something nonsense. How can I check it? There are so many nonsenses, and therefore we are trying to make all these nonsense into human beings. That is our program. So long he is a nonsense, he will go on speaking nonsense. What can I do?"
Guest (4),"Swamiji, one thing I want to know. Thisśloka,from where you have got it, thisśloka, lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam? Thisśloka, lāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam.",Prabhupāda," Yes. It is in the third chapter of Twelfth Canto ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Have you got ourBhāgavata,Twelfth Canto?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,I don't have it with me.,Prabhupāda," So you can note down. There are many things, that, thatdāmpatyeratimevahi:""A family life means sex life."" Andlāvaṇyaṁkeśa-dhāraṇam.All these symptoms which are now going on, that is foretold five thousand years ago in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Svīkāraevahiudvāhe:""Marriage will be by agreement."" These things are there. That I have..."
Indian man,(indistinct-loud static),Prabhupāda," No, but just like you know in the rainy season there will be heavy rainfall, but you can protect yourself. You can get raincoat, you can get umbrella. Then you will... [break] So you cannot stop the rainy season, but you can protect yourself. [break] ...so many Africans. We have many Africans, devotees."
Guest (3),Yes. Americans.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Have you got any picture?
Brahmānanda; Cyavana; Brahmānanda; Cyavana; Brahmānanda,"We have photographs of our temples in Kenya.; We have about thirty disciples in Nairobi, Africans.; You should see the film.; Yes.; If you come this evening, we have a nice film about our movement all over the world.",Prabhupāda, Yes. We go interior to African village.
Guest (4),"Swamiji, can I ask a question? How old are you, or, maybe I should say, how young are you?",Prabhupāda, Eighty years old. Eighty.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Here is one black American, asannyāsīin the renounced order of life. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...the bodily concept of life, he is no more African, no more American. He is spirit soul. [break]"
Guest (2),"...Swamiji, a very personal question. How would you react when people give you a godly reception?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Brahmānanda,"He asks, ""When you get a godly reception, when you come to a place, how does your..., receive it?""",Prabhupāda," Because I am representative of God, therefore they must give me godly reception. It is reception to God. Just like if you receive one ambassador from a country, then that means giving honor to that country. It is not my personal reception; it is acknowledging the glories of the Lord.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādaḥ**.It is said, ""If you please God's representative, then God is pleased."""
Guest (2),"Thank you, Swamiji.",Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa. (end)
Cyavana,The slightest tinge of a material desire will force him to take another body. Is that it?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Kṛṣṇawill give him full advantage of enjoying this material world. Unless he is disgusted, he cannot. He'll not become disgusted. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays, ""Give up this."" Personally, he is not going to be disgusted.māyā.ThereforeKṛṣṇapersonally asks him, ""Give up this business.""Sarva-dharmānparityajya[Bg.18.66].But we are thinking, ""Eh! Why this man asking like this?Sarva-dharmānparityajya.I shall give up my business, I shall give up my family, I shall give up my country and simply surrender to Him? Oh, it is too much. Sophisticated."" What is called? ""Sophistry."" What is sophistry?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Sophistry?,Prabhupāda, Yes?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,"Half wise, half foolish.; Sophistry means some...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,... philosophy that is not sound. Superficial.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is... That is the remark of Dr. Rādhākrishnan, whenKṛṣṇasaid like that. That means ""He... Too much,"" because he thinks, ""Kṛṣṇa is..., may be a very big man, but He's a man. Why He is asking like that?"" [break] ...first business is to give him always miseries so that he may be disgusted. But he is so foolish, he is not becoming disgusted. Everyone knows this is very troublesome world, but nobody is disgusted."
Cyavana,"He's like the horse who chases after the carrot. He never gets it, but still, he keeps trying for it. He never gives up. He keeps trying.",Prabhupāda," There are many examples.Matirnakṛṣṇeparataḥsvatovā.Only for this fault,gṛha-vratānām—""I shall be happy in this material world."" In Delhi, we established that center. You had been there?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Ananda...
Brahmānanda,AnandaNiketan.,Prabhupāda, Full of foreign embassies. So nobody came.
Brahmānanda,"They came the first night, and that was it.",Prabhupāda, Nobody came.
Brahmānanda,Neither were they very friendly.,Prabhupāda," They thought that ""We are living so nicely, embassy and ambassador, and living in such a nice house, comfortably. What is this nonsense, God?"" All these embassies and the ambassadors, they are prized post. It has no use."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"They're what, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Prized post only. Governors, the embassies, this is... These are invented to satisfy the agitators, politicians, because the opposite party will agitate."
Brahmānanda,So give them some house and some post.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Give them some. That's all. It has no use. They do not do anything. Simply hold that post and get nice house, nice salary, servants, honor, and sometimes they are called and make some speech. That's all. And whatever nonsense he may be, if he is governor, then everyone will respect him. That's all. And as soon as the same man is not governor, nobody goes to kick on his face. I have seen so many governors. When they retire, nobody... (aside:) Where is that cap? Nobody cares."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is this desire for material happiness the cause of material attachment?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Kṛṣṇabhuliyajīvabhogavāñchākare.When they forget to serveKṛṣṇaand wants to enjoy this material world... Don't you see that theseMāyāvādīphilosophers are trying for liberation, and still, they are expecting to become God. That is another desire.Daridra-nārāyaṇa.The high ambition, to become God or equal to God, that is going on, struggle for existence."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"What about these rascals like Sai Baba? They use Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, and then they twist it in such a way that it becomesMāyāvāda.",Prabhupāda," No, no. He's a cheater. People want to be cheated. They come tosādhufor some material benefit. Don't you see that people are so much anxious to touch the feet of asādhu?What is the reason? Reason is that if he gets some favor of thesādhu,""Then I shall be happy materially."" That's all. They have no idea, becoming servant ofKṛṣṇa.Āśīrvāda(Hindi)."
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Swami(?) Deji(?) once told me he once wanted yourāśīrvāda.I didn't know what the word meant. He was shocked. ""You don't know whatāśīrvādais?"" It was like I did not know anything because I did not know that. It means to take the benefit from theguru.; But if he's a realguru, then the real benefit will be there.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa,"To be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.; Do you want another cover, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," No. This is all right. [break] ...the male, that one."
Brahmānanda,The red one?,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is also male. [break] ...for their family.Gṛha-vratānām.Wife, children, they are also enjoying.Viṣayaḥkhalu...This wife and children and material happiness he will get in any form of life. So if the human life is also the same thing, then where is the benefit? But they are proud that ""The... They are loitering on the..., without any home. We have constructed this home. Therefore we are advanced."" This is their philosophy. The business is the same. ""That's all right. But we are improved."" This is advancement. Business is thepunaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30],the same sex, same eating, the same sleeping, same defending, but in an improved way. Even in the heavenly planet, wherever you go, the same thing, simply... Just like this country and Europe, the standard of living different, but the business is the same. And the... When they improve or so-call improve the standard of living, they think, ""Now we are advanced."" And what about your death? (aside:) Stop. The chicken is also dying; you are also dying. What is your improvement? That they cannot say. Real problem they cannot solve. Simply a little high standard of living, and they think this is advancement. And the Western civilization is influencing all other parts of the world in that way—""Improve the standard of living."" There is no improvement, but it ismāyā;they are thinking, ""This is improvement."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Progress.,Prabhupāda," Progress, yes. The progress is that they have got motorcar, and they have progressed how to die quickly. This is the progress. At any moment he can die. As soon as he on the car, 70 miles speed, that means taking the risk of dying at any moment. This is the progress. Formerly people were going in bullock cart or horse carriage from one village to another. ""That was primitive. Now we can go hundred miles away from home for earning money and taking risk to die at any moment. That is progress."" Is it not?"
Brahmānanda,"Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda," Formerly they were satisfied by tilling the ground, getting food grains. Now they have started factories. At the cost of thousands of men's labor, some director is getting money and enjoying life. That is progress. And these rascals, laborers, they are thinking that ""These men are getting the profit, cream of this business. We are working. Why not take ourself?"" That is Communism."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"There is one small coal mining town we didsaṅkīrtanaat, an Indian community. And they were thinking that ""The coal mine is doing everything for us. They're giving us schools, they're giving us medicine, they're giving us... Without the coal mine where would we be?""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,Here they think it's sugarcane. The sugarcane is everything.,Prabhupāda, Giving everything.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Why can't people understand to depend onKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda, There ismāyā.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Just like air that we breathe.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That ismāyā,no education. ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means we are giving intelligence; therefore they are understanding. But there is no such propaganda. There was no such propaganda."
Brahmānanda,"One of those reporters yesterday was saying ""Well, there's so many philosophies from India. Why have you started this one?"" But actually no other philosophy has given this message.",Prabhupāda," Therefore I said that ""Why you are bringing India? The whole world is in darkness."" (to passerby:)HareKṛṣṇa. Good morning."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"There's a verse in theBhāgavatam,Prabhupāda.Yenātmāsuprasīdati:""By rendering devotional service to the transcendental Lord, one becomes completely satisfied."" So what happens? These people in material life, they come to the temples and they chant a little bit. But they find that the standard of pure devotional service is so high that they're not able to grasp it. They don't feel the complete satisfaction. They're still attached to the material world.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is compared with the jaundice disease. Jaundice disease, for jaundice, sugarcane is the medicine. But they taste sugarcane as bitter. Sugarcane... One who is suffering in jaundice will taste sugarcane as bitter. That is the test. So that is the medicine. So he has to take the sugarcane. And by taking, when he is cured he will find, ""Oh, it is very sweet."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,So then he has to recognize there is some problem living in this material world.,Prabhupāda, No. He does not find any happiness on account of his too much materialistic mind.
Brahmānanda,That is the disease.,Prabhupāda," That is the disease. So it has to be cured by thisbhakti-yoga.So in thebhakti-yoga,in the beginning, it will taste bitter. Therefore they do not come. But if they take tobhakti-yoga,then the material disease will be cured and they will find it is very sweet."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. So the more people try to enjoy materially, they become more and more unhappy.",Prabhupāda," We are in the material world means everyone is diseased. [break]māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ,duṣkṛtinaḥ[Bg.7.15].This is described. This is the material disease. I explained how they are committing sinful life: slaughterhouse, this liquor house and so many things, simply sinful. And they do not know they are going to suffer again in another body. He's going to be slaughtered next life. ""Life for life."" You are taking life, so many lives; you have to give so many times life. Take birth and become killed. Take birth and become killed."" There is no knowledge."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Sometimes people ask, Prabhupāda, that if one falls down into lower species of life like plants or animals, how then do they come again to the human form of life?",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is nature's way. Give them again chance to develop. From trees they become flies. That is the beginning of movement. Then from flies to birds, birds to beast, and beast to animal, er, human being. This is great chastisement. You cannot move even. Suffer torrents of rain, cyclone, scorching heat, pinching cold. Stand up for hundreds and thousands of years. Then, when the punishment is finished, then he becomes moving. If there is scorching heat he can move to some shelter. But he cannot move. They do not study all this science, why there are so many varieties of life, of different grades. Wherefrom they are coming?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The living entity, then, in the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The living entity inside the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.,Prabhupāda," Not advanced consciousness, but he is conscious. He feels. He feels."
Harikeśa,"It shocked a lot of people when they made the test of bringing a scissor to a plant, and they put some electrodes on it and they found that the plant was reacting with fear.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. That machine has been discovered by Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. He discovered this wireless telegram, radio. But Marconi took from him, and British government helped him."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The British again.,Prabhupāda," Britishers were advertising outside India that ""Indians are uncivilized. Therefore we are making them civilized. Therefore we should stay there. Don't object."" Because United Nations, they were asking, ""Why you are occupying India?"" So they used to forward this argument, that ""These people are uncivilized. We are making them civilized."" (laughter) Now, how there should be Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose? Therefore they used to suppress always. Everything Indian wanted to do, they would suppress: big businesses, this mining... They would suppress. This Morarji, Sumati Morarji, her father-in-law started that... He had to face so many impediments from the Britishers to start the shipping company. Formerly there was no shipping company, Indian. Now, before that, there was shipping, not shipping company, but navigation was there from India toRome, Greece, Turkey, there was regular business of spices and fine cloth. Later on, this large-scale shipping industry, that was done by the Europeans. So when Indian wanted to start, they would supress. TheTatairon industry, he had to face so many difficulties. Formerly, even if you wanted to bring some iron frame, it would come from Sheffield."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,From where?,Prabhupāda, Sheffield.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Oh, England.",Prabhupāda," England. So everything Indian required, they would supply, and they would govern and they would exploit. Therefore they became so rich—simply by exploiting India. And Indian soldiers, they expanded empire-Africa, Burma. That's all, all Indian exploitation, Indian men, money, and exploitation. As soon as they lost India, they lost whole empire."
Cyavana,Now they are also suffering.,Prabhupāda," Eh? That... That must be. They will be suffering more and more. They will be beggars. They have done so much sinful activities for expanding their empire. Now they will have to become beggars. And within two hundred years, everything finished. They started their exploitation from seventeenth, eighteenth century. And in the twentieth century, everything finished. The French people and the English people... This is also one of the examples. Both the nations came here to exploit. That was the competition in... The French people and the English people, they would go for colonization, fight, and establi... America was also that, Canada, everywhere. But because they were their own men, they were given dominion status. Almost free."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,Greedy. Very greedy.; At one time all of Africa was controlled by the European nations. Completely.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Mainly these French and...
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"French, British, Germans, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish.; In South Africa, the British also tried to take over South Africa. There was a war called the Boer War.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"So during World War I and World War II many of the South Africans, they actually sided with the Germans because they were against the English so much.",Prabhupāda, African means black Africans. No?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"No. South Africans, they were Europeans. The British started the first concentration camp. They took these ""Afrikaners"" as they call them, Europeans. They put them on an island called St. Helena. That was actually the first concentration camp, by the British.",Prabhupāda," This is going on. Still, even the opposite party, they are not disgusted—""This material life is not very peaceful."" They are not disgusted."
Brahmānanda,"Now they are thinking, ""We'll be independent...""",Prabhupāda," Yes. That... They are trying to be independent. And India... Just like India has got independent, and now the position is ""emergency."" They do not think in this way, that ""Independence or dependence, we are actually dependent under the laws of nature."" That they do not think. They are thinking... The same example as I gave, that ""This boil is here. Why not here? It is very painful,"" like that. They have no sense that so-called dependence or independence, he has to suffer. That he does not know.Mūḍhanābhijānāti."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"In theBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇaexplains,vāsudevasarvamiti,that He is everything and that He is everywhere.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"So this verse,mūḍho 'ya nābhijānāti,that themūḍhas,they can't perceiveKṛṣṇa. So actually it's simply that we're covered, isn't it? ButKṛṣṇais always there.",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇais always there, butyogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ.He does not knowKṛṣṇaon account of being covered by the curtain ofyogamāyā. Nāhaṁprakāśaḥsarvasyayogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ[Bg.7.25].But we can make them all happy byKṛṣṇaconsciousness, if they follow our instruction, even in this material world.Pūrṇaṁsukhāyate.Full happiness we can give them if they follow our principle."
Cyavana,They have so many doubts.,Prabhupāda," What is the doubt? Doubt means they cannot drink, they cannot continue slaughterhouse, they cannot continue brothels. That's all. This is their doubt, that ""How these things will be maintained? This is our life."" That is doubt, and that is the difficulty. As soon as we say, ""No this,"" oh, they are in danger. Even Marquis of Zetland, ""Oh, it is impossible to give up. This is our life."" There is the difficulty. Otherwise, there is no difficulty. They cannot think of, especially the Westerners, that without these things one can live. So many, our disciples, left. Rāyarāma left: ""Oh, Swamiji is denying the preliminary necessities of life."" This is the preliminary necessities of life: illicit sex, meat-eating, drinking, gambling. They cannot think that a man can live without these things. Therefore people are wonderful, that ""How he is turning these Europeans, Americans to this standard?"" That is their wonder. Nobody can think of, that these things can be given up and one can avoid it. It is dream. Your government, American government, is also surprised that ""We have spent so much money for stopping this LSD, and this man by saying his disciples, they are giving up."" Judah has also mentioned that. That is their surprise—""How these things can be given up? It is impossible."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,You once said in Geneva that no one has died by giving up smoking.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Actually that is the fact. You have given up these four bad things, and what is your wrong, harm? Rather, you have become bright-faced. But they will not give it up. They think, ""It is impossible."""
Brahmānanda,"They say we have just undergone some religious conversion and become fanatical, and therefore we have given up.",Prabhupāda," No, why don't you become fanatical? (laughter)"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Although it says in theBibleeven that one should praise the Lord's name with cymbals and drums...,Prabhupāda," They have no concern withBibleand God and everything. They are simply after sense gratification. What is the use of quoting aboutBible?They don't care forBible.The Europeans, Americans, they have rejected, thrown away, kicked outBiblebecause (it is) unscientific. Actually they do not accept. Although they call themselves Christian, they do not accept anything ofBible.That is...Bibleis finished. There is no meaning ofBible.Simply for their sectarian prestige, they say""Bible.""But actually they have nothing to do withBible.What do you think?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Yes, it's true.",Prabhupāda," They do not go to the church, but they come to us for arguing withBible.Just see. What is the meaning? Their churches have closed, nobody goes, and they come to argue with us withBible.That means ""The Devil cites scripture."" They are devils, and they are quoting fromBible."
Devotee (2),"So many people who come to our program, they are Christians. There may be 75% who come. They are all Christians.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. We don't discriminate whether he is Christian. We take everyone as human being, welcome. So what do they say? They also quoteBible?"
Devotee (2),"They say that their priests tell them, ""You just listen to me and forget about theBible.""",Prabhupāda," And who are you? Then I can say also, ""You hear me. Forget aboutBible."" Anyone can say. Why the priest? Wherefrom the priest has come? Has he dropped from the sky? (laughter) That's it. Everyone can say, ""My dear priest, you hear me. Don't talk of yourself. You hear me."" Everyone can say. Then? How things will be adjusted? The priest is also a man; I am also man. If he can say like that, I can say like that. Then who will make adjustment? Who is correct? Hm? How it will be adjusted? If everyone will propose something, and who will say, ""Now, out of so many proposals, this is correct."" That means chaotic condition. If everyone says, ""What I say, you hear."" Then who will hear? Everyone will say only. Who will hear? That is going on actually. And rascal Vivekananda says, ""Everyone's opinion is good."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Yathāmattathāpath.,Prabhupāda," Yathāmattathāpath.This is going on. Everyone will say something, and it is all right. However nonsense it may be, it is all right. EvenGandhifollowed that philosophy. Therefore he invented one, another philosophy, nonviolence, which is impossible. When Hindus approached him, that ""You have got so much influence over the Mohammedans, so why not stop cow killing?"" he said, ""It is their religious principle. How can I interfere?"" Just see."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya.Kṛṣṇaorders inBhagavad-gītā, go-rakṣya.",Prabhupāda," And he is considered to be a great scholar inBhagavad-gītā,and when cow protection was requested, he said that ""How can I do it? It is their religious principle."" And he is a great big scholar inBhagavad-gītā.All nonsense, going on. Whole world is full of nonsense,mūḍhas,beginning fromGandhito any rascal, all of them, rascals. Perhaps it is the first time we are detecting, ""Here are all rascals."" It is first time. Then we are enemy of everyone. We call everyone rascal-Gandhirascal, Vivekananda rascal, Aurobindo rascal. So actually they are, but people are thinking, ""These people say all big, big men rascals? Therefore they are rascals."""
Cyavana,The average man doesn't have the intelligence to discriminate between an intelligent man and a fool. He will listen to anyone.,Prabhupāda," No, we have got this from the standard test tube,Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who is notKṛṣṇaconscious, he isduṣkṛtina,mūḍha.That's all. We have no difficulty. Just like that urine test? We have got... One who has got that testing paper, red, yellow and so on, so on... So we have got this testing paper,Bhagavad-gītā."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"[break] Prabhupāda, Lord Caitanya's weapons were His associates. LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu's weapons were His associates.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Sāṅgopāngāstra-pārṣadam.Therefore NarottamadāsaṬhākura said,gaurāṅgerasaṅgi-gaṇe,nitya-siddhakorimāne:""All the associates of LordCaitanya, they are ever liberated.""Nitya-siddhakorimāne.""Anyone accepts the assistants of LordCaitanyaas ever liberated—he also becomes liberated, simply by accepting the associates of LordCaitanyaMahāprabhuwho is helpingCaitanyaMahāprabhu's mission, simply by accepting this, the man who is accepting, he becomes liberated.""Sejāy brajendra-nandapāś.Gaurāṅgerasaṅgi-gaṇe,nitya-siddhakorimāne,sejāy brajendra-nandapāś."
Cyavana,This is the way to go up.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] ...this is a fact, that ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the topmostyoga, and preach it. This is a fact. Except we,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, nobody knows anything—allmūḍhas.Any association, any religion—allmūḍhas.But you must prove yourself. Otherwise it will be bigotry. If you simply say that ""We are only first class"" without any knowledge... You have to defend yourself. There will be so many opposing elements. Then you become first class. Your position is first class, but you have to maintain it. Otherwise, they will say ""religious fanatics."" Any opposition party, you have to meet. That is required."

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa,"[break] (Devotees have been teasingPuṣṭaKṛṣṇain background regarding his suggestion) He said, ""Don't bring milk when water is required."" I was just asking, you know.; Don't bring milk when water is required. You have given the example.",Prabhupāda, Don't bring milk?
Devotees,When water is required.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But he was thinking that it would be very nice to sit there with Śrīla Prabhupāda.; No, no. No, I wasn't. I was thinking of Prabhupāda's satisfaction. You're thinking what I'm thinking...",Prabhupāda," You are right. He was right. That is service. Before wanting, that is... That is all right. ""Now let the master refuse it."" But service is: before he asks, the thing should be offered. That is service. After asking, offering something, that is second-class service. First-class service, before he wants, ""Here is the thing, ready."" That is first-class service. Now it is his liking. He may not like that. He may ask something else. But the service must be offered. And your example, milk and water, is not applicable here. I did not ask him either milk or water. (laughter) So your example is futile."
Cyavana,Perfect.,Prabhupāda, So don't be discouraged.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"No, Prabhupāda. I'll never leave your lotus feet. They asked you about other movements yesterday at the press conference...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"...this movement and that movement. You said, ""This is Kṛṣṇa's movement."" So this should be our line of argument, because especially amongst the Indian community, when they question us about this swami and that swami...",Prabhupāda," They replied that in everything there is light. And yes, the light of, what is called, glowworm and the light of sun is not the same. Everything is light; that doesn't... We haven't got to accept so-called lights. Even there is light, when there is sunlight, why you should aspire after glow of light? (People chanting in background) Who is chantingHareKṛṣṇa?"
Cyavana,Everyone is sayingHareKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, HareRāmaHareRāma. (laughter)
Devotee (2),So all those sinful activities of these people have been eradicted now by sayingHareRāma?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Immediately. That is the special advantage of this age.Kirtanādevakṛṣṇasyamukta-saṅgaḥ[SB12.3.51].Immediately becomes free,mukta-saṅga.Without becomingmukta-saṅga,they cannot chant even. Why others are not chanting, they are chanting?"
Devotee (2),But the same... That means they will make more sinful activities?,Prabhupāda," If he does, that is another thing. Otherwise, for the time being, he is freed from all the reaction of sinful, immediately.Sadyaḥsavanāyakalpate. Sadya,immediately. Immediately he becomesbrāhmaṇa."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is pious activity on the material platform?,Prabhupāda," No, no. It is transcendental, above pious activity. By accumulation of pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental position.Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ[SB10.12.11].Puṇyameans pious activities. After doing for many, many years simply pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental platform. So pious activities cannot be compared with transcendental activities. But it may help in the long run. Therefore transcendental activities does not depend on pious activity. It is not dependent. Then it will take long, long years. But automatically he becomes pious, achieves the result of pious activities."
Cyavana,"[break] ...the standard of morality, Arjuna's activity of killing was immoral.",Prabhupāda," Morality, immorality, this is all creation of mind. Real purpose of life, to serve the order ofKṛṣṇa, that is real morality."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"I think that we must all bekṛpa-siddhi,because by your mercy you have lifted us out of hellish conditions of life.",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa's mercy. You have accepted Kṛṣṇa's mercy. This is the... [break] This empirical policy was very good, provided it would have been done forKṛṣṇa. Then they could unite the whole world."
Brahmānanda,They had very good managing talent.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. But the whole thing was planned for their own sense gratification."
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Exploitation.; If we ever had any kind of power like that and tried to do something like that, they would accuse that this is like the Crusades.",Prabhupāda," Now, Crusades, even... If they could expand the ideas of Christian, love of Godhead, that was nice. But that was not the purpose. It is exploitation."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Even by force?,Prabhupāda," Yes. By force if you give some good medicine, that is good for him. In my childhood I would not take medicine. Exactly like this, now also. (laughter) So I was given medicine by force in the spoon. Two men will catch me and my mother take me on the lap and then force and I shall take. I never agreed to take any medicine."
Harikeśa,"Should we do that now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Then you'll kill me.
Harikeśa,You would not go to school either.,Prabhupāda, I don't like... Yes.
Harikeśa,"You were telling us last year, you wanted to playmṛdaṅga.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The bus is coming.,Prabhupāda," [break] ...disagreement between my father and mother. My father would give me all independence, and mother was going that ""You are spoiling the child by giving too much independence."""
Harikeśa; Prahupada; Brahmānanda; Cyavana,"Just see.; That is going on. Just like motherYaśodā. She would chastiseKṛṣṇa. But you will never findNandaMahārājais ever chastising. Rather, whenKṛṣṇawas chastised,NandaMahārājawould come back and take Him on the lap: ""All right, I shall punish Your mother,"" and call him (her?), chastise. And thenKṛṣṇawill stop His mouth: ""No, no. Don't do this."" It is natural that when the child is in the lower stage, minor stage, the mother takes more care. That is natural. [break] Such a big planet, sun, six months rotating on the northern side of the equator, six months on the southern side. It is never changed. Why?; It's an accident. (laughs); The sun doesn't change?",Prabhupāda," No, theuttarāyana.Now it is passing on the northern..."
Brahmānanda,Now it's on the southern?,Prabhupāda," Southern side,dakṣiṇāyana,yes."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The scientists say that the earth is actually tilting back and forth like this, that the sun is not...",Prabhupāda," Why it is tilting, rascal? Stop it."
Cyavana,No. Every time is perfect.,Prabhupāda," That is my question. That is answered inBrahma... Yasyājñayā,by the order ofGovindait is being done."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The seasons are changing.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Yasyājñayābhramatisambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.The orbit fixed up to the sun by the order ofGovinda, that is being followed by him."
Devotee (2),Does the heat of the sun increase or decrease through the ages?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Everything is in the hand ofKṛṣṇa.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,But they are thinking He is just a historical figure.,Prabhupāda, Therefore they're rascals. Why do you say like that?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda; Cyavana,"Avajānantimāṁmūḍhāḥ[Bg.9.11].; All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end); ...convert the Hindus to Christianity, the children.

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Finding new suckers. In South Africa they put up bigpaṇḍāls,and because the Indian people, they have no entertainment in the evening, so they go there and they are entertained, and they learn how to sing the hymns that they have. Then you find that the children are singing the hymns because that's the songs that they're learning. If we can provide entertainment like that in the form ofsaṅkīrtana,then they'll also singHareKṛṣṇaand become devotees ofKṛṣṇa. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...own Christian priests, they asked me that ""Why Christianity is dwindling? What we have done?"" So I told them, ""What you have not done?"" (laughter)"
Cyavana,Yes.,Prabhupāda," ""You have violated from the very beginning the orders of Christ, 'Thou shall not kill,' and you are killing, only killing. So what you have not done?"""
Devotee 1,They say that man has to dominate over the animals. They should...,Prabhupāda," Therefore you should kill and eat them. Very good reasoning. ""The father should dominate over children; therefore the children should be killed and eaten up."" So rascals, and they are professing religious leaders."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Prabhupāda, if every moment we are killing in breathing and walking and doing so many things, and then it says, ""Thou shalt not kill,"" so then hasn't God given us an instruction which is impossible?",Prabhupāda," No. Conscientiously you should not. But unconsciously, if you do, that is excused. [break] ...napunarbaddhyate(?). Āhlādinī-śakti,it is pleasure potency. So pleasure potency is not painful toKṛṣṇa. But it is painful. It is painful to us, conditioned souls. This Golden Moon (name of a bar?), everyone comes there for pleasure, but he is becoming implicated in sinful activities. Therefore it is not pleasure. It will give him pain, so many aftereffects. Sex life, even it is not illicit, still, it is painful, aftereffects. You'll have to take care of the children. You have to bear children. That is painful. You have to pay to the hospital for delivery, then education, then doctor's bill—so many painful. So this pleasure, sex pleasure, is followed by so many painful things.Tāpa-karī.The same pleasure potency is there in the living being in little quantity, and as soon as they utilize it, it becomes painful. And the same pleasure potency in the spiritual world, Kṛṣṇa's dancing withgopīs,that is not painful. That is pleasing. [break] ...man, if he takes nice foodstuff it is painful. If a diseased man, if he takes..."
Cyavana,He becomes more sick.,Prabhupāda," More sick. Therefore this life is meant fortapasya,not to accept-voluntarily reject. Then it is nice. [break]"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,...ments today are supporting the most outrageous sinful activities.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The governments today are supporting the most outrageous, sinful activities. So how is it possible to reform the general mass of people?",Prabhupāda, Do you mean to say the government is perfect?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,No.,Prabhupāda," Then? They must be moved. Government means, nowadays, all rascals. They are elected by rascals and they are rascals. That is the difficulty. Everywhere you go, you will meet only rascals.Manda.The definition is given,manda.Even in our camp there are so many rascals. Just see the report. Even they have come to be reformed, they are rascals. They cannot give up their rascal habits. Therefore it has been generalized,manda:""all bad."" But only difference is that in our camp the bad's are being reformed; outside there is no reforming. There is hope of their being good, but outside there is no hope. That is the difference. Otherwise everyone is bad. Without any discrimination you can say.Mandāḥsumanda-matayo [SB1.1.10].Now, how the government will be good? This is also bad. Mahāprabhu's name isPatita-pāvana; He is delivering all bad men. In theKali-yugathere is no good men at all—all bad. Strong you will have to become to deal with all bad men.

Cyavana,Yes. It's coral. It's from coral.,Prabhupāda, An animal.

Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"When you were speaking with those two boys last night, that was the Minister of Youth who was sitting with the High Commissioner. He was appreciating that they were coming to challenge, that they were understanding. They cannot understand their own so-called culture. They have not been able to get the young people here to adopt it. Instead they are trying to imitate the West.; Blind leading the blind.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes. Did you understand the words, ""The blind leading the blind""? Do you agree? [break] ...culture, the basic principle is mistaken, bodily concept of life. How it can be perfect? [break] ... world's present so-called culture based on misconception. Therefore it cannot be perfect. Whatever they are doing, it is failure."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Can't satisfy anyone. Now people are under the conception that culture means that you can satisfy anything you like, any desire. Therefore there is birth control and so many things. So they are thinking that ""If we can satisfy all of our desires, it is very nice culture.""",Prabhupāda, But where is satisfaction?
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"They think that unhappiness comes from repression of one's desires.; Yes. They think that actually that we're suffering from so many desires, that we must be very poor creatures because we become devotees.",Prabhupāda," So why so many desires? Because one desire is not complete, therefore you desire next. Therefore the process of desiring is defective, and our process is to purify the desires, not to remain in the imperfect platform of desiring, but whatever desire you have got, just purify it. Then it will be satisfied. So desire produced by bodily concept of life will never be satisfied. Therefore some of them are trying to become desireless, the impersonalists.Nirvāṇa."
Brahmānanda,That is also impossible.,Prabhupāda, That is not possible.
Indian man 3,"Still there is a desire to become desireless. [break] ...nice example for Mr. Seller, amurghee(?).He thinks the rains are getting under and then cutting his slack.",Prabhupāda, Expensive. [break]

Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The size has changed. It has grown, increased.; It looks different, completely... It looks different. There is no similarity.",Prabhupāda," Yes. There is no similarity. Why the child... There was no mustaches. Why you have mustaches? How you can say ""The same body""? You shall have to give your own argument. Child had no mustaches; you have got now mustaches. How you can say the same body? The child had no sex desire; now you have got sex desire."
Brahmānanda,"They would say all these things are dormant within the child's body, and now they are coming out.",Prabhupāda," That we also say, but that body not... That ""dormant"" means dormant in the soul, not in the body. That is the knowledge. Dormant it is, but dormant in the soul, not in the body."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"They have to admit that it's a different body because if the body is simply made of food and they are eating so much and evacuating so much, then it has to be a different body.",Prabhupāda," No, it is different body, undoubtedly. If they foolishly argue, that is different thing. Therefore rascal. Their argument has no value. How you can be the same body? So many changes. The body is changed. (to Indian man:) What is that? It was notgaram?"
Indian man (1),"No,garamnot.",Prabhupāda," So this argument, how he can refute, that he has died twenty-two years?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,"Well, he can also say that he has lived twenty-two years, because he has no perception of any life before that time. He can't remember living before.; ""Before, I was not alive. Now I am alive, so I have lived for twenty-two years. Before, I was dead; I was not alive. Now I am alive, so I've been alive for twenty-two years.""",Prabhupāda," So before, you were not alive. Then how your life came?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The combination of...,Prabhupāda," Do it. Again foolishness. These rascals... (laughs) Then, if you can create life, then where is the question of dead body? You create again. Give life again. If you are so competent that you can give life, combination, then this dead body is there. You bring chemicals and inject."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The same chemicals are there, too. The same chemicals, living body, dead body—five minutes before, five after—is the same chemicals. But they can't explain why there is such a drastic difference.",Prabhupāda, What is that same chemical?

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Let him try and make life. Not possible.,Prabhupāda," If you know the chemical, then you bring it. Chemical is available. Why this is dead? What they will answer? What this chemical is wanting, that it is dead?"

PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The same chemical is there. Two minutes before death and two minutes after death, the body chemistry has not changed so much.",Prabhupāda, No. What is that missing that it is dead?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,They can't answer.,Prabhupāda, Therefore they are fool. You cannot answer.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Because it's not a question of chemical. Actually they don't know what life is.,Prabhupāda," Therefore they are foolish. Therefore he has to take knowledge fromKṛṣṇa:dehino 'sminyathā...""Within this body there is soul."""
Brahmānanda,"You say there's a soul, but we've never seen a soul. It may be your imagination.",Prabhupāda," You may not see. You have not seen your forefather. That does not mean... This is all bad argument. Why do you believe? Your eyes are so imperfect; still, you say, ""I did not see. I want to see."" What is the value of your eyes? You see the sun globe—a small disc. But is it so? Then how do you know that it is so big?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,By hearing.,Prabhupāda," By hearing. That is important, not by seeing. Thereforeśruti,Veda,is important, not your eyes."
Harikeśa,"When people die, though, there is usually some cause. Like they have a heart attack or they get hit by a car or some disease. So that death is caused by the disease...",Prabhupāda," That is not the cause. That is the effect. You foolish, do not know. You are taking it, cause."
Harikeśa,"Well, when you get hit by a car, that's a cause.",Prabhupāda," Just like one man becomes insolvent, loses everything. So he said that ""I had no money. Therefore I become insolvent."" But that is not the fact. He could not manage; therefore there was scarcity of money and he became failure. So that is effect. On account of his bad management, he came to a position that he could not pay to his creditor, and his business is failure. So that insolvency is not the cause. It is the effect."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Bhīṣmawas able to remain in his body even on a bed of arrows.,Prabhupāda," So when you are going to die, these are the... On account of imminent death, these are the effects."
Harikeśa,But that means that the body breaks down.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,The body breaks down.,Prabhupāda, At a certain period it will break.
Harikeśa,"So that is the cause, the body breaking down.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So you say heart failure is the cause. No. The body is breaking; therefore heart failure.
Harikeśa,So death means the body breaks.,Prabhupāda," No, no. First of all your answer... You say the heart failure is the cause. The man is dying. I say that because the man is dying, the heart is failure. So heart failure is not the cause. It is the effect."
Harikeśa; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,"That's very difficult...; Because hiskarmain that body is running out, he has to leave.; But if I can get some machine that will make the heart keep on beating, then the man won't die.",Prabhupāda," No. That you are failure. You have got so many machines. You go on, keeping the heart going on. That is not possible."
Harikeśa,Finally they just pull out the plug. The doctor kicks the plug one day.,Prabhupāda, (laughs) Yes.
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"At the present moment, I was reading, there is one girl in America, New Jersey, teenage girl. And for some unknown reason she went to sleep one night, and in the morning she did not wake up. So they then rushed her to the hospital, and they have an artificial machine that is keeping her alive, and this has been going on for one month. All of her bodily functions are becoming more and more diminished, but still, by this machine, she is alive. Now this has gone on for one month. So now they don't know what to do with her. Should they keep her like this, just running on the machine, or should they stop the machine and then she will die? This is a big legal problem. They don't know what... If they stop the machine, they'll be accused of manslaughter.; Some Catholic priest said that better to let her die, because this is God's way.",Prabhupāda, Then he has to accept the God's way and give up the machine.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But in a situation like that, isn't it more valuable to preserve human life because there's the chance...",Prabhupāda, What is the use?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"There's a chance that somehow or another, they might be...",Prabhupāda," Why should you take the chance? You are perplexed with overpopulation. And why you want to stay? One side, you are perplexed with overpopulation. Let him die."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,But they can use the argument that you're saying that human life is simply forKṛṣṇaconsciousness or God consciousness.,Prabhupāda," No, from his argument, why should you try to keep it? Let him die."
Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,"They are afraid of death. No one wants to die.; They are afraid someone will take them off the machine, too.; We want to live as long as we can.",Prabhupāda," Then you have to accept that your killing child, abortion, that is sinful."
Cyavana,"It's easier for the mind to accept what is apparent to the senses. For example, to accept that I am this body is easier for my mind than to accept a philosophy which you say that we are not this body. That is very difficult for my mind to accept, whereas I can accept very immediately that I am this body.",Prabhupāda," Because it is difficult, therefore you are a fool. That proves that you are a fool."
Cyavana,"Why should I strive for something so difficult, such a philosophical understanding, when I can live very happily with this body?",Prabhupāda, But because you do not want to die. You want happiness.
Cyavana,So I can enjoy this body.,Prabhupāda," You cannot. That is the difficulty. You want, but you cannot. You want. That I know. But you cannot do it."
Harikeśa,You never see happy people.,Prabhupāda, That is their ignorance. They are accepting unhappiness as happiness.
Brahmānanda,"Well, in this world there has to be some unhappiness and there has to be some happiness.",Prabhupāda," But we are trying to give you happiness only, no unhappiness."
Cyavana; Brahmānanda,But that's not possible.; That's artificial.,Prabhupāda," That you say, but we know."
Cyavana,We cannot see.,Prabhupāda," You cannot see, but you will see if you be trained up. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement."
Cyavana,"But it is easier for us to remain here and enjoy a little bit and accept a little suffering, accept this body.",Prabhupāda," ThereforeKṛṣṇasaid that ""Bhagavad-gītāshould be discussed amongst My devotees, not amongst the rascals."" It will be waste of time.Yaimaṁparamaṁguhyaṁmad-bhakteṣvabhidhāsyati.Find out this verse."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,,Prabhupāda," Not to the fools and rascals. So first of all, to give them chance, let them come to the temple, takeprasādam,hearsaṅkīrtana,offer obeisances by imitating others. In this way, when they become little devotee, then instruct. Otherwise it will be useless. You'll waste your time by arguing."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"You have given the example that the field has to be plowed before the seed is sown, cultivated.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Cyavana,The mind has to want that higher taste.,Prabhupāda," Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12].So this process... Bring the... Invite them. ChantHareKṛṣṇa, dance, give themprasādam.Everyone will take part in this way, not immediately instructing that ""You are not this body; you are soul."" He will not be able to."
Cyavana,It's too difficult.,Prabhupāda," Therefore this process is recommended.CaitanyaMahāprabhuargued withSarvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya,PrakāśānandaSarasvatī, not with ordinary public. Ordinary public—""Go on chantingHareKṛṣṇaand dancing."" Never argued, neither He discussedBhāgavatam.For ordinary public-four hours'kīrtana,chanting and dancing,bas.And then give them sufficientprasādam:""Takeprasāda."" This process... Because unless he has got littleśraddhā,he will simply put some false argument and waste your time. Not in the beginning.Mad-bhakteṣvabhidhāsyati.First of all create him a devotee a little. ChantHareKṛṣṇa-harernāmaharernāmaharernāmaivakevalam[Cc. Ādi17.21]—only. Because this isKali-yuga,people are so fallen, so downtrodden, so rascal, cats and dogs. It is very difficult. But this process—chanting ofHareKṛṣṇamahā-mantra,giving them chance to hear it and takeprasādam—that will cure. And that is easily accepted by anyone. It doesn't matter what he is. Anyone will accept. To chant and dance and takeprasādam—no one will disagree. So this is the process. When they come to the temple... Just like these boys. You are offering obeisances; they are also offering. But that will go to their credit, to becomebhakta.This process should be adopted. Not in the beginning, but in the beginning give themprasādam,chantHareKṛṣṇa. And try to sell some book. You pay something. That means he is giving some service, the hard-earned money. That will also go to his credit. And then, when he'll concerned that ""I have paid for it. Let me see what this nonsense has written. All right. Read."" And that will also convince him. This is the way. He'll keep this body, book, and show some friend, so the infection will go on."
Cyavana,"We can see in some of our boys in Kenya. Practically they have no education and very little intelligence, but still, they are doing everything. They're falling down. They are offering all the prayers. They are takingprasādam.They are chanting. They are doing everything, even they don't have the intelligence to understand why.",Prabhupāda, You said that no chemical is missing.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,No chemical difference.,Prabhupāda, But why it is dead?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The body is dead? Well, they haven't been able to determine that yet.",Prabhupāda, Then they are rascals. There is no argument because you do not know.
Cyavana,"They say ""fate."" They say ""There is fate.""",Prabhupāda," Faith we have got, but you have no faith."
Cyavana,Not faith. Fate.,Prabhupāda, What is that fate?
Cyavana,"Predetermined, predestined.",Prabhupāda," Who made it, the predestination?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Prahupada; Cyavana,"Higher controller.; Then you have to accept some higher authority, God.; But he is not a person. He is not a person.",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be. That is another thing. That is another question. But you have to accept some superior authority. As soon as you accept fate, destiny, then you have to accept superior authority."
Cyavana,"They also say ""nature."" They say ""by nature.""",Prabhupāda, Whatever it... Whatever it may be. You have to accept some superior authority. That means you are not independent. You are under the control of the superior authority.
Harikeśa,Time. Time is...,Prabhupāda, Whatever it may be. You call by any name. That is another thing.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"These bodies are a reaction, effect, isn't it? These bodies are an effect.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,So then death also must be some effect.,Prabhupāda," So who has made this law, cause and effect? Some way or other, you have to accept that you are not independent."
Harikeśa,"Their arguments are so foolish, it's hard to think of them.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Thereforemūḍha,they have been described.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15].They are being kicked, punished; still, he says, ""Oh, I don't care for anybody."" I kick on your face. ""Yes, I don't care for you."" Like that. This is their argument."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,"Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.; But because everything in this world appears to be disordered, it is difficult to accept...",Prabhupāda, The world is not in disorder.
Cyavana; Brahmānanda,But it appears to be.; Man makes order.,Prabhupāda, Man makes order?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Is... Your idea is that he conceives of the order. But actually there is no order, but he...",Prabhupāda," When there is cyclone, man can stop?"
Cyavana,For example this beach is all disorder. There is so much rubbish there. There is no order to this world. So how can there be any higher authority...,Prabhupāda, So what you can do?
Cyavana,"I cannot accept that there is a higher authority when everything is simply disorganized. These trees are broken, the...",Prabhupāda," It is organized. It is organized. For thousands of years the sea is there, the beach is there. So sea cannot come here. This is order."
Cyavana,But the line of the beach is all crooked and...,Prabhupāda, That is your imperfect vision. It is perfect.
Harikeśa,"People think, ""Straight and corners, that is very nice. If everything has corners...""",Prabhupāda, That is your concoction.
Cyavana,"Like a building, straight.",Prabhupāda," Just like if you think that ""Why keep to the left? Why not right?"" You think like that, but that is ordered by the superior. You can think in your own way."
Cyavana,"Because it appears that way to my senses, therefore I think that...",Prabhupāda," Therefore it is authority. You can think like anything, but it will not be done according to your desire. It will be done by the authority's desire. That is authority. You cannot dictate the authority that ""You do like this."" That is not authority. You think any way; that is your business. But authority will do in their own way."
Harikeśa,"Actually, nobody cares about philosophy. Nobody follows philosophy.",Prabhupāda," No. He cares for death. That is the ultimate philosophy, that they have to die. Say, ""I don't care for this order. I'll not die."" Then your disobedience is all right. But you have to die. You have to become old man. How you can disobey?"
Cyavana,"So if death is imminent, then I should simply try to enjoy myself as long as I can.",Prabhupāda, Enjoy. What is that enjoyment if you are going to die?
Harikeśa; Brahmānanda,"It's so incredible how crazy everything is.; Well, at least before I die, I can get as much pleasure as I can.",Prabhupāda," Nobody can, if he is actually afraid of death. Suppose if you are given a beautiful woman—""Enjoy, and as soon as you come out I will shoot you."" (laughter) Will you enjoy?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,That's a great example. That example would change the world.,Prabhupāda," That is the difference between a man of knowledge and a fool. Man of knowledge, that is that he knows he has to die. ""But I don't wish to die. So what is the solution?"" That is man of knowledge."
Harikeśa,"Sometimes they say ""Well, why worry about death? It's gotta happen anyway, so why should we worry?""",Prabhupāda," But you... You... Because you are rascal number one, you don't worry, but that is the psychology. This is the example."
Harikeśa,But I want to enjoy right now.,Prabhupāda, Suppose that you enjoy this woman for few minutes. Then you will be shot down. Then will you be able to enjoy?
Brahmānanda; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,Actually they do that. When some man is to be executed in the prison they give him one woman the night before as a special consolation.; They finish him off completely. They ruin him. (laughing); But death is very far away from me. I am only thirty years old. I don't have to worry about death.,Prabhupāda, What is the guarantee that you will live thirty-one years? What is the guarantee that you will live thirty-one years? There is no guarantee.
Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But everyone else around me appears to be having fun and enjoying.; They can use this argument though, Prabhupāda. I've heard it before, that ""So God has placed us in this world. Okay, there is God, and He has placed us in this world, and He has created the world also, and He has made these things very, very enjoyable, sex life, and this and that. So why not enjoy if God has created it?""",Prabhupāda," That is foolishness. That is foolishness. It is not enjoyable. That is... If a criminal says, ""The prisonhouse is very enjoyable,"" it is like that."
Cyavana,"But all the travel brochures and the advertisements, they say it's nice here. All the advertising and travel brochures, they say it is nice.",Prabhupāda," Let him say, but prisonhouse, is it nice? That is foolishness."
Cyavana,But everyone else says it's nice.,Prabhupāda, Everyone? I don't say.
Cyavana,You are the only one who says it is not nice.,Prabhupāda, I am the only intelligent person. (laughter) That's a fact.Mūḍho nābhijānāti.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Kṛṣṇasays,antavattuphalaṁteṣāṁtadbhavatyalpa-medhasām: [Bg.7.23] ""Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary."" So does this mean that these less intelligent people who are simply interested in temporary benefit... Even they don't worship demigods perse, it could be anyone.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Demigods... Yes. Just like one who is trying to get some good service. So they are worshiping this boss, that boss. That is also demigod, because without flattering some boss he cannot get some good job; without flattering the voters he cannot get the ministership. That is demigod worship. They have to flatter somebody. Why this Ram Gulab has gone to...? He has to flatter there. This is going on. The big bosses in the United Nation, they are demigods, supposed to be. He thinks, ""If I flatter them, then I will be able to keep my position."" But he does not think that this position will be lost after some years.Tadbhavatyalpa-medhasām.He has forgotten his eternal life,Kṛṣṇa, and he is flattering these demigods. That's all. What he will gain? He will die. That's all. At the time of death what these United Nation leaders will do?"
Cyavana,"But we can improve the standard for future generations, for our children.",Prabhupāda," First of all you improve your own condition; then think of future generation. You are going to hell and thinking of future generation. You are going to die, and you are thinking of future generation. Who is your future generation? That is another foolishness. This is asuric civilization. Asuric civilization."
Cyavana,Hope against hope.,Prabhupāda," Hope, that is also foolishness. Apart from future generation, you have got sons. So you are taking very great care. Does it mean that his life is guaranteed? So what you can do? You cannot do anything for your present generation, what to speak of future generation. You cannot do. Suppose your son is sick. As father, you have given first-class medicine, first-class physician. Does it guarantee that he will live? Then what can you do? Is it in your control that your son will live because you have given good physician, good medicine? Is it guarantee that your son will live? Then what can you do? You cannot do anything for your present generation, and you are thinking of future generation, which you do not know, who is your future generation. At the present moment you know this is your generation, you cannot do anything, and you are thinking of future generation. How foolish you are."
Cyavana,"Well, we may have to accept the laws of nature, but at least we can...",Prabhupāda," And therefore, what is the meaning of taking care of future generation or this generation?"
Cyavana,At least we can make it comfortable in this world.,Prabhupāda," No. That is not possible. You have already given good medicine, good physician. And why he is dying? You cannot do anything. That is your position. You may try to do, but that is futile. Ultimate is different."
Cyavana,"So by giving him medicine, maybe I can give him a better chance...",Prabhupāda," ""Maybe"" can be, but it is not guaranteed. You cannot do anything."
Cyavana,But at least I should try.,Prabhupāda," Try. Foolishly you try whatever you like. That is another thing. But it is not under your control. You can try. That is your... Of course, you must try as a dutiful father, but you should know that you cannot take any guarantee or do anything, good or bad. That you have already said, ""the destiny."" That is prominent. That is prominent, not you."
Cyavana,The tendency of the humans...,Prabhupāda," You can do the best to train your child to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. That is in your power. That you can do. That is the best service, not anything else. That is not possible. If you become yourselfKṛṣṇaconscious, and if you try to make your sonKṛṣṇaconscious, that you can do. And that is the duty, real duty. Other things, you cannot do anything. That is destiny. And if you make himKṛṣṇaconscious, then destiny can also be changed. This is the concession ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Destiny also can be changed.Karmāṇinirdahatikintucabhakti-bhājām[Bs.5.54].One who comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, hiskarmais also changed."
Cyavana,Is thatkarmadovetailed?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Cyavana,It's still there.,Prabhupāda," Still can be changed bybhakti.Just like one man is condemned to death. Nobody can change it, but the king can change it. Only by the mercy of king he can be saved, not otherwise. Even the judge who has punished him, he cannot do it. Whatever is ordered, there is order. He cannot change it. Similarly, if you become devotee, then your destiny can be changed. A devotee never is anxious to change his destiny. That is devotee's..."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,"LikeMahārājaParīkṣit.; But if his destiny takes him away fromKṛṣṇa, then he is not...",Prabhupāda," That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. IfKṛṣṇadesires, He can do anything. So a devotee does not interfere with Kṛṣṇa's desire."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,We know thatKṛṣṇadesires everyone to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that is...Kṛṣṇasays. That is His desire.Sarva-dharmānpa...,māmekāṁśaraṇaṁvraja.That is Kṛṣṇa's desire."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,SoKṛṣṇais not causing everyone to forget Him.,Prabhupāda," No. Kṛṣṇa's desire is open to everyone. We don't accept it. That is our obstinacy.Kṛṣṇasays ""There is soul."" We do not say. ""No, there is no soul."" This is our position.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Within this body there is soul,"" and we don't accept. We'll argue. This is our position. He is giving direct instruction, ""Yes, there is soul,"" but we don't accept. Disobedient."
Cyavana,"But ifKṛṣṇaknows that we will suffer in this material world, why does He let us go away from Him? Why doesn't He keep us there?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Cyavana,"IfKṛṣṇaknows that we will suffer here in this material world if we come here, why does He let us go?",Prabhupāda," Why the thief goes to the prisonhouse? He knows that ""If I go to the prisonhouse, I will be put into distress."""
Cyavana,"But the government is not strong enough to force him not to go, not to steal.",Prabhupāda, Why government is not strong enough?
Cyavana,The government doesn't have the power to control everyone. ButKṛṣṇacan...,Prabhupāda," No. Even if he's strong enough, you disobey. The government has made so many things that you cannot steal, the iron chest, but still, you are clever enough that you do."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The independence is there. Sometimes people ask, Prabhupāda, that if the spiritual world isānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12),full of bliss, then how is it that, somehow or another, we've left that blissful situation and come into this hellish...",Prabhupāda, This argument we have talked many times. Everyone knows that out of prisonhouse freedom is there. Why he goes to the prisonhouse? Everyone knows it. Why does he go to the prisonhouse?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,"Not by choice. He is placed there.; Kṛṣṇais the supreme controller. If He wanted to check us from going there, He could check us from going into the prison, from offending.",Prabhupāda," No.Kṛṣṇahas given you independence. So you are.... By mentality, you have to suffer. Suppose if a child wants to do something, play, if you check it, check it, then he will gomad. Just like motherYasodawas showing stick toKṛṣṇa, and whenKṛṣṇabecame so much afraid, he (she) became immediately anxious: ""Oh,Kṛṣṇahas too much anxiety. He may fall sick."" So immediately throw away. So this is father-mother's affection."
Cyavana,"So actually it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy that He allows us to come here, free ourselves from...",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. He has given you little freedom. He doesn't want to take your freedom.
Harikeśa,"You gave two examples in Los Angeles about the master, big master, like president of DuPont walking his dog. The president of DuPont is walking his dog in Central Park. The dog makes him go this way and this way and this way. And you said we are just passing stool and urine in the material world, andKṛṣṇais just letting us run here and there.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Anumantā.In theBhagavad-gītāit is said,anumantā,upadraṣṭā."
Cyavana; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"In theCaitanya-caritāmṛtain one of your purports you gave the example ofParamātmābeing compared to when there is a circus in a village the government sends one inspector to watch over the activities. Then, when the circus goes, he is no longer there. Could you explain it? (pause); Prabhupāda, ifKṛṣṇais the reservoir of pleasure, then what does He need us for? IfKṛṣṇais all blissful, then what... We're so, it seems, incapable of pleasingKṛṣṇa. He is so magnanimous. What does He need us for?",Prabhupāda," He does not ask for Himself. For you. If you come toKṛṣṇaand enjoy with Him, that is your good. He is self-sufficient. He doesn't require."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Sometimes, Prabhupāda, when they see yourBhagavad-gītā,they say, ""Oh, it is too big for me to read."" They don't know that the purport.... They've never read.",Prabhupāda," Therefore I say that bring them, let them chant and dance and takeprasādam.That, everyone will hear, agree."
Harikeśa,"One who does that, he is preaching? One who arranges for chanting and dancing and takingprasādam,that is as good as preaching?",Prabhupāda," Yes.Śravaṇam,kīrtanam,arcanam—anything."
Harikeśa,These festival programs are very important.,Prabhupāda, (pause) You have to spend or waste gallons of blood before you can convert a person toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. It is so difficult task.
Cyavana,You have to spend?,Prabhupāda," Gallons of blood, waste."
Cyavana,In what way?,Prabhupāda," By talking with him, with the rascal and foolish. You tax your brain and spoil your energy, blood."
Harikeśa; Cyavana,Spend so much food.; So we should do that.,Prabhupāda," Unless you are not a preacher. You should be prepared. Yes. They cuts, sacrifices life, what to speak of wasting blood. Wasting life. This is preacher. Then he is recognized byKṛṣṇa: ""He has done so much for Me."""
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇawill give more and more energy.,Prabhupāda," He is going to die forKṛṣṇa, and therefore he is recognized.Nacatasmānmanuṣyeṣukaścin mepriya-kṛttamaḥ[Bg.18.69].You become immediately very dear toKṛṣṇa. Your business is how to become very intimate toKṛṣṇa. That will be served by preaching."
Cyavana,Would you like to hear this verse?,Prabhupāda, Who?Yaidaṁpara...
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"""For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to me.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Sometimes... I've had one person. He complained, ""Why is there no purport for this verse, 'There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear'?""",Prabhupāda, No purport?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Yes. They have mentioned that there is no purport for this verse.,Prabhupāda, It is already explained. Anyone who is preaching...
Harikeśa; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,That verse is self-effulgent.; Yes.; You are the purport.; Simply people are trying to find out ways that they don't have to surrender to perfect knowledge. They can go on enjoying in the material world.,Prabhupāda, Wanted... (indistinct) A little... (indistinct)
Harikeśa,I think you should preach every breakfast. Your appetite is very good.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,Every breakfast you should preach. Then your appetite will be very good.,Prabhupāda," No, appetite or no appetite, I preach. (laughter) I do not preach for increasing appetite."
Devotee 2,Do you want this?,Prabhupāda, Hm? Yes. What is that?
Brahmānanda,This islavaṇa-bhāskara[āyur-vedic medicine for increasing appetite].,Prabhupāda," Lavaṇa-bhāskara,it is? No. Yes. Yesterday night what did I take?"
Harikeśa,"At night you're supposed to take tripolin(?), no?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa; Prahupada; Brahmānanda,At night Prabhupāda takes tripolin(?). After meals he takes thisBhāskara-lavaṇa.; But...; At night you took this one?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"No, at night he's supposed to take tripolin.",Prabhupāda, You follow. (end)
Cyavana,"Yes, gradually. They are attracted.",Prabhupāda, Hm? You are reading books?
Indian boy (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Cyavana,"One boy last night, he said he was ready to move into ourāśrama.",Prabhupāda, Let him.
Cyavana,Yes?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Let him move. But he is going to cut his hair?

Cyavana,They are very interested in our philosophy.,Prabhupāda, The leaders?
Cyavana,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So why do they not accept it?
Cyavana,"Gradually they will. They are attracted. They will accept. [break] ...only here I have seen. All the islands on the Pacific and Indian Ocean are all potential. Philippines, very... The Philippine boys, I saw, very nice. They are not guided. Fiji also.",Prabhupāda," Fiji. Fiji also. Fiji, mostly Indian, but the original Fiji Fijians, they are also very nice."
Cyavana,What aboutBali? There are also many...,Prabhupāda," Bali, there are practically Hindus. Yes. Everywhere. The soul is pure. They have been made impure by misleading."
Cyavana,All the outside influences are also here trying to make propaganda.,Prabhupāda," Just like here, this ismāyāinfluence. These things should be stopped."
Cyavana,The Chinese come and make propaganda. The Russians come and make propaganda. The Americans come and make propaganda. They become confused what to do.,Prabhupāda," The climate is nice. There is good potential for producing food, keeping cows. Everything nice."
Devotee,"It is all volcanic. The soil here is all from volcano, volcanic soil, very rich.",Prabhupāda," Oh? Volcanic or not volcanic,pūrṇamidam[Īśopaniṣad,Invocation].When it is created by Lord, it is complete. You are originally from India? No."
Indian boy (2); Indian boy (1),"No, Mauritius.; Our father from India.",Prabhupāda, All of you? Bihar? No.
Indian boy (1),"Bihar, yes, Bihar.",Prabhupāda," [break] ...is also known asMagadha.Magadha. That is the... Candragupta and others, they were reigning in Bihar, emperor of India.Jarāsandhaalso belonged to Bihar. [break] ...a great scientist?"
Cyavana,"Yes, I studied.",Prabhupāda, How this sand is made?
Cyavana,From the rocks it is... They call it weathering. The weather makes it ground up from the rocks. This is their theory.,Prabhupāda, No.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa; Cyavana,"Isn't it shells from the animals?; Some. Some from rocks, coral.",Prabhupāda, It is made from salt. It is called sodium silicate. (laughter)
Cyavana,"They say this is combination of shells, coral, and rocks, ground up.",Prabhupāda," No, no."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But if it's salt, Prabhupāda, our experience of salt is generally that it dissolves in water, isn't it?",Prabhupāda, Silicate there is.
Indian boy (2),Salt and silicate.,Prabhupāda, You know something of science?
Indian boy (2),Some.,Prabhupāda, It is melted in fire and glass is made.
Cyavana,It becomes clear.,Prabhupāda," No, that you have to add chemicals."
Cyavana,Oh. [break],Prabhupāda," Hawaii, on the beach side, there are many, many coconut, eh?"
Harikeśa; Cyavana,"Hm.; Many of them have been ripped up by the cyclone, pine trees and coconut trees.",Prabhupāda," In Hawaii there is no cyclone, I think. Hm?"
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda, Why?
Harikeśa,They have a volcano on one island. There is one volcano that goes every twelve years.,Prabhupāda," Here there is any volcano, on this island?"
Cyavana; Indian boy (2); Cyavana; Indian boy (2); Cyavana; Indian boy (2); Indian man (3); Cyavana; Indian man (3); Indian boy (2),"Nothing left.; Only once. Once we had.

There was a volcano here?; Yes.; When?Huh?; A crater, it...; We are not so sure.; Recently it came up?; No, we are not so sure because before human settlement in Mauritius.; No, but it is...

Indian boy (2),"Creation, how... About the creation. I have read it fromBibletoo, aboutAdamand Eve. Do you think that it's true?",Prabhupāda, What is the idea ofAdam?
Indian boy (2),God has created him.,Prabhupāda," So the same process is mentioned inVedas.God createdBrahmā, and he created this universe."
Indian boy (2),All which we can see on the earth have been created by...,Prabhupāda, Brahmā.
Indian boy (2),Brahmā. Who isBrahmā?,Prabhupāda," Brahmāis the first creature in the universe, created by God. He came from the navel."
Indian boy (2),"Therefore, by himself he could create everything, Swamijī?",Prabhupāda, Who?
Indian boy (2),Brahmāhimself? He is only one...,Prabhupāda, Yes. He was empowered.
Indian boy (2),He was only one person.,Prabhupāda," Empowered by God. God createdBrahmā, and he was empowered to create the universe."
Indian boy (2),"There should not have been two people, a female and male?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Indian boy (2),"There should not have been two people, a male and a female, to create everything?",Prabhupāda," Yes, male and female."
Indian boy (2),"Then, apart fromBrahmā, there would have been something else.",Prabhupāda," No,Brahmācreated male and female."
Indian boy (2),"Oh, he himself created it from...?",Prabhupāda," From his ear, from his eyes, from his..., like that. From many parts of his body."
Indian man (3),"Swamijī, there is something quite confusing.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Indian man (3),"LordKṛṣṇacreated LordViṣṇu, and LordViṣṇuin His turn created LordBrahmā. So...",Prabhupāda," Not created, expanded. Just like one candle is burning, and youlitup another candle. So this candle is not created, it is simply power transfer. Expansion. You can call it expansion.Dīpārcirevahidaśāntaramabhyupetya[Bs. 5.46].Expansion of the light. This is, contains iodine, this ship. Iodine. That ship is going or coming?"
Cyavana,Going. But he's sitting.,Prabhupāda," Oh, it is standing."
Cyavana; Indian boy (2),"It's sitting, yes.; Swamijī, do you think thatBible,about theAdam,AdamisBrahmā? It has been copied from the Indian philosophy to put it there in different name?",Prabhupāda," From historical point of view it is copied becauseVedasare created byBrahmālong, long, many millions, millions of years, andBibleis created two thousand years. So we have to take the original. All religious system of the world, they are taken fromVedas,from different parts. Therefore they are not complete. The age ofBibleis not more than two thousand years. The age ofVedayou cannot calculate, millions and millions of years."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Why is it, Prabhupāda, that in earlier parts of theKali-yugano one like yourself came throughout the rest of the world and preachedKṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda, Huh? Preached?CaitanyaMahāprabhupreached. His descendant preached. Why do you say no one preached?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But throughout the rest of the world, places likeJapanand Australia...",Prabhupāda," Your calculation of the world. If it is preached anywhere, that is preached on the world. It was not spread, you can say, but it was preached."
Cyavana,The seed was planted.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,They were saving it for you.,Prabhupāda, For you also.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"I think they had their hands full with India. They had their hands full with India, all of the preachers.",Prabhupāda, Yes. What they are collecting?
Harikeśa; Indian man (4),"Crabs, I think. Crabs.; Swamijī? It is prohibited to consume, consume flesh, meat. It's because there is soul in the body and if we kill it, therefore we are doing a sin. I think it's because that we can't consume meat according to the Vedic literature. But what about plants, Swamijī?",Prabhupāda," Plants also, you... They are also killed. They are also killed. But this is... Plants are killed by the order ofKṛṣṇa. Therefore you are not responsible."
Indian man (4),"Therefore, if we say that we can kill some animal by the order ofKṛṣṇa...",Prabhupāda," Yes, then you are not responsible. Suppose I kill one snake by the stick. The stick is not responsible; I am responsible."
Indian man (4),When do you think that you'd know thatKṛṣṇais responsible and not our...,Prabhupāda," You learn from theśāstra.You learn fromBhagavad-gītāwhatKṛṣṇasays and do it. Then you are not responsible for anything. Just like there is lawbook. If you act... (aside:) Don't keep so near. ...act according to lawbook, then you are not criminal. If you violate the lawbook, then you are criminal. Similarly, whatKṛṣṇasays, that is recorded in theśāstra,especially in theBhagavad-gītā.So you act what is said in theBhagavad-gītā;then you remain free from all sinful reaction.Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra lokoyakarma-bandhanaḥ. Yajñārthātmeans forKṛṣṇa. Whatever you do, that's all right. Otherwise you are become bound up by the reaction.Anyatrakarma-bandhanaḥ.Karma-bandhanaḥmeans you are bound up by the reaction. So therefore you have to act according toKṛṣṇa. That isKṛṣṇaconscious. If you act differently, then you are responsible."
Indian man (4),"How would you know what to consume and what not, Swamijī?",Prabhupāda," That is stated in theśāstra.Kṛṣṇasays,patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].Patrammeans vegetable, leaves;puṣpam,flower. In this way, whatever He says, you collect and offer to Him and takeprasādam.Then you are not responsible. And if you collect for yourself evenpatramwithout offering toKṛṣṇa, if you take, you are responsible for killing. It doesn't matter whether you kill a big animal or a small plant. You are responsible. Just like a soldier. He kills hundreds and thousands of men and he is given gold medal. And as soon as he kills one man for his sense gratification he is hanged. Eh? Is it not? He can say, ""I have killed so many men. At that time I was not hanged. I was given gold medal. How is that? (laughter) I have killed only one man. I am going to be hanged?"" That is law. You cannot do anything on your own account, sense gratification. Then you are responsible.Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yakarma-bandhanaḥ.Everything is stated. ReadBhagavad-gītāvery thoroughly and try to understand. Then everything will be clear, how to live, how to organize society. We have to live. The same thing: we are also working, we are also eating, we are sleeping, we are also marrying—but according to Kṛṣṇa's direction. Then it isKṛṣṇaconscious life and perfect life. And as soon as you do anything whimsically, at your will, then you are responsible.Kṛṣṇaor His representative.Kṛṣṇais giving instruction, and His representative is explaining. In both waysKṛṣṇais helping. So even so much facility being offered to you, if you don't take advantage, then you are committing suicide.Ātmahā. Ātmahā.Just like the sea is now calm and quiet. If you want to go somewhere, take advantage of it. And if you start your boat while it is cyclone, then you'll be drowned. SoKṛṣṇahas left the book of instruction,Bhagavad-gītā.It is favorable condition. And the spiritual master is the captain, and you take advantage. Your, this human body is a good boat. So good boat, favorable condition, good captain—take advantage of crossing this ocean. Otherwise you are committing suicide.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].It is very difficult to cross over this ocean of nescience, but these are the favorable conditions. One should take advantage of these favorable conditions and cross over this ocean of nescience."
Devotee (5),"Many people, they don't want to accept a captain. They want to go all alone.",Prabhupāda," Let them be drowned. Who can check them? If they do not accept good captain, let them be drowned. There is no regret for them. Let them go to hell. They are going, actually. For their dog's obstinacy they are going to hell.Adānta-gobhirviṣatāṁtamiśram[SB7.5.30].This is stated. Because they cannot control their senses they are going to hell."
Indian man (4),"Swamijī, is there any hell, or rather this is hell...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Why not? Why not?"
Indian man (4),Above the world or in the world?,Prabhupāda," Huh? You know everything, where, what is where? Do you know? Then why do you ask this question? There is. There is. There is planet, hellish planet."
Indian man (4),"I don't know, I have thought about this, that the hell of thepradas(?)exists only in this world itself.",Prabhupāda," Because you are the frog of the well. The frog of the well thinks, ""This well is everything."" And if you say, ""There is Atlantic Ocean,"" he cannot imagine, the frog of the well. You know frog of the well?"
Indian man (4),"Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda," A three-feet well, and a frog is there and he is thinking, ""This is everything."" And some friend comes and informs, ""Oh, I have seen very big water, Atlantic."" He simply imagines, ""Oh? It's big? How much big? One feet more? All right, two feet. All right, three feet,"" like that. So the frogs in the well, they cannot understand. You should be not a frog in the well; you should be liberal to hear from the authorities,Vedas.Then you will understand. And if you remain a frog in the well... All these rascal scientists, they are all frog in the well. They have got little calculation of this planet, and they have no information of... There are so many millions of planets. What do they know? They cannot, could not study even this moon planet. Wrongly study. The moon planet is above the sun planet, 1,000,600,000 miles above. What do they know? They are thinking the moon planet is in between the earth and the... So the all wrong calculation."
Indian man (4),"Swamijī, it has been said just as we act... We take birth according to our action. So if we have done something we must take birth according to the law of God.",Prabhupāda, You must take birth. That is a fact. You cannot avoid it. But according to yourkarmayou have to take birth.
Indian man (4),"This means that you pay what you have wrote. Yes, eh? Therefore do you think that...",Prabhupāda," Suppose when your, this shirt is torn, you have to purchase one shirt. Now, that shirt you have to purchase according to your price. If you have good price, then you get a good shirt. If you have no money, then you get a bad shirt. That's all."
Indian man (4),"I wanted to say this, Swamijī, that hell also is situated in this world itself, because where do you think that we can pay our debt?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Indian man (4),"The sin, the debt of our sin. Where do you think that we pay it? In the hell, which is not...",Prabhupāda, Hell is the place for your punishment.
Indian man (4),Therefore it is on the earth itself.,Prabhupāda, Why earth?
Indian man (4),"In the planet earth, no?",Prabhupāda, No. It can be...
Indian man (4),In any planets?,Prabhupāda, ...many millions miles away.
Indian man (4),"But it is not locate... Only hell is located in one place or aprada(?)is located in another place? Do you think so, Swamijī?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes. There are different planets.
Indian man (4),There are many people who suffer in this world itself.,Prabhupāda, So they are first of all trained up in that hellish planet and then they come here to suffer the same standard of life.
Indian man (4),"When our soul gets out from our body, it goes to the hell or...",Prabhupāda, Hellish planet.
Indian,...hemisphere or it take birth immediately afterwards?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Those who are sinful, they do not take immediately birth. They first of all trained up in the hellish planet how to suffer to become accustomed and then they are taken birth, then suffer. Just like you pass I.A.S. Then you become an assistant to the magistrate. You learn. Then you are posted as magistrate. Even if you are fit for going back to home, back to Godhead, you are first of all transferred to the universe whereKṛṣṇais now present, and there you become accustomed. Then you go to realVṛndāvana."
Indian man (4),"Therefore, after our death...",Prabhupāda," Every arrangement by God is perfect.Pūrṇam.Pūrṇamadaḥpūrṇamidaṁpūrṇātpūrṇam.. [Īśopaniṣad,Invocation].Whatever is created by God, that is perfect."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,All the associates of LordCaitanyaalso were in the same position.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Liberated souls. Does LordCaitanyaalways appear just afterKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda, Hm.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,In every universe.,Prabhupāda, Hm. [break] All questions are answered or not yet? Make it clear.
Indian,Yes. I am thinking about it.,Prabhupāda, [break] ...the science ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness and educate your men on this island and be happy. There is good potency for this island.
Cyavana,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Don't be misled by the misleaders.
Cyavana,There are many of them here also.,Prabhupāda, [break] ...here in the understanding and help your people. That is good service.
Devotee (6),"Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was asked a question by a man. He asked that Lord Śiva... LordRāmacandrawas praying to Lord Śiva in theRāmāyaṇa,and so he's taking Lord Śiva as being God. And we didn't have a clear answer to him.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (6),"Could you just instruct us on this matter, why...",Prabhupāda," LordRāmacandraworshiped His devotees. Just like sometimesKṛṣṇaworships Rādhārāṇī and touched His feet..., Her feet. That does not mean thatKṛṣṇa... Just likeKṛṣṇawas tolerating ear pulling by motherYaśodā. That does not mean that motherYaśodāis the Supreme. Hm?Kṛṣṇawas carrying the wooden shoes ofNandaMahārāja. So that does not meanNandaMahārājais greater thanKṛṣṇa. It is Kṛṣṇa's pleasure. Just like sometimes a father takes the son on the shoulder, carries. Does it mean the father is inferior than the son? So this is third-class man's conclusion. They do not know what isKṛṣṇa, what isRāma.Kṛṣṇasays thatahamādirhidevānām[Bg10.2].So He is the origin of Lord Śiva. So how Śiva can be the Supreme? We have to consultśāstra.Kṛṣṇadoes not say that Śiva is Supreme. So if a third-class man says Śiva is Supreme, we have to accept it? We are preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness. WhateverKṛṣṇasays, that is Supreme, not a third-class man's version. Is it clear? Yes. We should not take a third-class, fourth-class man's version. We should take from theśāstra."
