Viśāla,(in background) Glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.[Break] It is the grace of Providence you do not see that it is properly cleansed.
Viśāla,I'm sorry. I will see to that...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viśāla,Your Divine Grace. That is my fault.,Prabhupāda," Why there is water? This water means the shoes, dirt, it will be dirty. So you have no eyes to see?"
Viśāla,I am blind. I am sorry. I will see that it is cleaned for you.,Prabhupāda," Then become with eyes. Simply praying, what you will do? Do something practical."
Harikeśa,"This is the argument people always throw against us. ""Simply praying, what will you do? Do something practical."" They say this all the time.",Prabhupāda, Everyone will say that.
Devotee orVraja-vāsī,Haribol!,Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.So they are guests. They are coming.Kṛṣṇasays everything practical. He never says that ""You press your nose and everything will come."" He never said like that. ""You become ayogiby pressing your nose, and keep your head downward, and then you'll become perfect and everything will come."" He never says. AndArjunaalso never accepts anything impractical. That isBhagavad-gītā.As soon asKṛṣṇasaid that ""You practiceyogaby this way "" immediatelyKṛṣṇasaid ""My dearKṛṣṇait is not possible, for me. I cannot control my mind.""Vāyorevasuduskara.""It is impossible as to control the air."" If somebody says, ""I shall control the air..."" So these things are there in theBhagavad-gītā,all practical.Kṛṣṇawas accepted the Supreme Lord by His practical instruction and practical features. They are not followingKṛṣṇathemselves also. That is the difficulty. [break] What is going on here? [Break] Private.Huh?"
Indian man,Rudra-yajña.(Bengali),Prabhupāda, Somebody is exploiting.Rudra-yajña.[break] ...any mention ofRudra-yajña?In theBhagavad-gītāthe word isyajña.Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra.Where isRudra-yajña?(Hindi)
Harikeśa,How does one stop cheating in a world of cheats?,Prabhupāda," This material world is meant for cheating. You cheat, and others will cheat you. That's all. This is material world. It is not ""how?"" If you inquire, ""How it is cold?""... The season is cold. There is no question of how. The place is for cheating and cheaters. So there is no question, ""How it is cheating?"""
Harikeśa,So you can't stop the cold.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,You can't stop the cheaters.,Prabhupāda," No. Yes, it is not possible. But you can do everything by becomingKṛṣṇaconscious. That is the advantage ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66].You cannot get out of sinful action, butKṛṣṇacan do it. Therefore He says, ""I'll get you released."" You cannot get released; therefore He says, ""I'll do that."""
Harikeśa,So bringing it to a practical platform...,Prabhupāda," Practical means it will be done byKṛṣṇa. Your only business is to surrender toKṛṣṇa. You cannot do anything. And as soon as you think that ""I shall be able to do it,"" then you are a rascal. Immediately you are rascal."
Harikeśa,So only a fully surrendered soul can do everything perfectly.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,A fully surrendered soul is the only one who can do things perfectly.,Prabhupāda," He cannot do anything, even in his... Everything is to be done byKṛṣṇa. But he has to apply his intelligence byKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Even if he is intelligent, he cannot do anything."
Harikeśa,Except surrender.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He can surrender, andKṛṣṇawill do everything. You have to act very sincerely under the direction ofKṛṣṇa, and then the war will be successful, asArjunadid."
Harikeśa,So imperfect activity is a sign of lack of surrender.,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break]...avaśyarakṣibekṛṣṇa.Rakṣiṣyatiitiviśvāsa-pālanam.You work sincerely, devoutly, and have faith that ""Kṛṣṇa will save me from all dangers.""Rakṣiṣyatiitiviśvāsa-pālanam.""I have surrendered toKṛṣṇasincerely. NowKṛṣṇawill give me all protection."" This faith, that is the beginning of devotional life. (aside:)HareKṛṣṇa. Faith."
Harikeśa,"So this faith, is thisśraddhāorniṣṭha?",Prabhupāda," Śraddhā.Beginning,śraddhā.Then, when he is advanced, then he becomes fixed up. ""Yes,Kṛṣṇais protecting me."" [break] ...that here is some goddessKali, and nobody is living here."
Harikeśa,"No, and then they worship in that temple. That's a temple there.",Prabhupāda," Oh. (aside:)HareKṛṣṇa. No, the road is, er,gateis closed. [break] People in general, they take that ""There is no God, and if there is God, He is now dead."" This is general impression."
Harikeśa,"There is one nice thing I saw on one wall. It says, ""God is dead. Nietzche ""And then right underneath it somebody wrote, ""Nietzche is dead. God.""",Prabhupāda, Nietzche? Nietzche means?
Harikeśa,"Nietzche, that philosopher. He was the one who first...",Prabhupāda, (Aside:)HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.Yes.
Harikeśa,"Nietzche first brought up the philosophy of ""Everything is nothing,"" for the Western people. ""It's all nothing. It all ultimately boils down to nothing. So there is no possibility of God.""",Prabhupāda," Śūnyavādī. Śūnyavādī.That isśūnyavādī.Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādī. Śūnyavādī,they say, ""There is no God, and there is nothing, fact. Everything is combination of some illusory things."" This isśūnyavādī.And theMāyāvādī,they say, ""Yes, there is God, but He has no form."" Therefore we have to kill both of them.Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavād-pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe.The whole Western world are filled up with theseśūnyavādiand impersonalists. India is also nowadays, but there are, still there are devotees in theācārya-sampradāya.They are fighting againstśunyavādaandnirviśeṣa."
Harikeśa,In South India I think a lot of the Rāmānuja followers are.,Prabhupāda, Yes. [break]
Akṣayānanda,"If everything was void, then there would be no hope for living. So might as well die.",Prabhupāda," No. By combination, permutation, you create, and if you don't want it, then avoid this combination. [break] Even in four o'clock time, visiting, if he comes at four o'clock, you let him come in. [break] ...Gurukula we require teachers for teaching the small children. So our, these girls, they cannot take this charge of teaching?"
Akṣayānanda,"Yes, one is already teaching now. One is already teaching children now, one girl.",Prabhupāda, Who is he?
Akṣayānanda,Her name is Ruth. She's English. Every afternoon she teaches the children.,Prabhupāda, Indian?
Akṣayānanda; GopālaKṛṣṇa,"No, English.; There's also one in Bombay. She used to be a public school teacher in England. After the school is open she can come over here. And there's one in Māyāpur, but she's teaching in Māyāpur.",Prabhupāda," Similarly, other girls, they can take up this."
Akṣayānanda,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda," ...our guest. Because somebody is guest, paying guest, therefore we shall admit anyone in any kind of dress?"
Akṣayānanda; GopālaKṛṣṇa; Akṣayānanda,"No.; We don't admit people who look like hippies or something.; That girl, I told her she had to wear asari.And she did for some time, but then again she stopped.",Prabhupāda," That I am speaking, thatsayadikrīyaterāja."
Akṣayānanda,Due to habit.,Prabhupāda," Sakrn nasnuta pahanam(?) That is the difficulty. It will be very bad example. People will think... They already thinking that ""These are all hippies."" That will minimize the prestige of the temple. [break] Jaipuria House they do not allow any hippies. You know that?"
GopālaKṛṣṇa; Akṣayānanda,"Jaipuria does not allow any foreigners at all. They don't allow any foreigners at all, even if somebody is decently dressed.; One boy came a couple of weeks ago. He had long hair. But the next day he came back and shaved up. He's a devotee now. He's doing nicely.",Prabhupāda, That's nice.
Akṣayānanda,So they will still come. They can become devotees. It's all right then.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa. [break]
Akṣayānanda,"...doing, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If they come and they have long hair but if there's a chance they might become devotees, I tell them they must tie up their hair in such a way that you cannot see it.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. If many comes like that to become devotee, then it becomes a devotee place, er, hippie place. You give them chance to become a devotee. In the meantime, it will be known as a hippie resort."
Harikeśa,That's always been a problem here.,Prabhupāda," It is no problem. You can allow for three days only. If he does not change his habit, then he must go."
Akṣayānanda,Yes. all right. [break],Prabhupāda," ...was in the beginning allowing, but they saw some disadvantage. Therefore they have stopped. [break] ...ourDhanañjaya?"
GopālaKṛṣṇa,He's sick.,Prabhupāda, Every morning he is sick.
Harikeśa,He had typhoid.,Prabhupāda, Typhoid?
Harikeśa; Bhāvānanda,Yes. (end); Someone had mentioned that we should start up in Bihar and come down into Bengal.,Prabhupāda, Do you think if they go to Orissa it will be nice? No? Thesaṅkīrtanaparty.
Akṣayānanda,Orissa will be nice?,Prabhupāda, So you talk with him.
Bhāvānanda; Akṣayānanda,"Yes. [break]; ...say to me what do I think of Pāgal Bābā? And I would say, ""Well, ourGuruMahārājadoes not approve of us smoking cigarettes."" And they will say, ""But he smokes cigarettes."" And I would say, ""That is because he ispāgal."" And they would agree. [break]",Prabhupāda," These four principles will make so many bogusbābāsas useless, simply if you follow these four principles. [break]"
Akṣayānanda,...thatRāmacandraate meat. Some people have said to me...,Prabhupāda," Rāmacandracan eat you and the whole universe. (laughter) Can you do that? By... EvenRāmacandraused to eat meat, so you can simply imitate for meat-eating. But why don't you imitate how to construct a bridge over the ocean? Why don't you say thatRāmacandraconstructed a bridge on the ocean. Can you do that?"
Akṣayānanda,No.,Prabhupāda, Then you are rascal.
Akṣayānanda,"But in theBhagavad-gītāit says,yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhas[Bg.3.21].Whatever the great men do, you must follow in their footsteps.",Prabhupāda," Yes. By their instruction, not by their activities. You should follow the instruction, not the activities. HasKṛṣṇasaid anything that ""You also actrāsa-līlālike Me?"" Has said?"
Akṣayānanda,Never.,Prabhupāda," Then how you can? These rascals, theseMāyāvādīs,they playrāsa-līlā.[break] ...ācaratiśreṣṭhasmeans thatśreṣṭhais ordinary person, but notBhagavān.Bhagavāncan act any way. And still,Bhagavānhas never instructed you that ""You imitate Me in raising theGovardhanaHill."" Has He said like that, that ""You also raise theGovardhanaHill like Me""? [break] ...ordersman-manābhavamad-bhaktoṁad-yājīmām.That is for you. Always think of Him. Always become His devotee. Worship Him. Offer your obeisances. That's all. That is for you. Yasodamayi was askingKṛṣṇa, ""My dearKṛṣṇa, can you bring the slipper of Your father?"" He could not. He was a small child. Still, with great difficulty He could raise that. But the person who can raise theGovardhanaHill, He was feeling difficulty to raise the slipper? Why? If at that time He becomes likeGovardhana, Giridhārī, then thelīlābetween father and son will be damaged. He plays just like a child. Although He can raise even in that age, to raise the hill. One should understandKṛṣṇa. Everyone compares Him with ordinary man: ""Kṛṣṇa has done this? Then I shall do.""Kṛṣṇahas done so many other things. Why don't you do it? This rascal... Anyone who imitatesKṛṣṇaon the plea that ""Kṛṣṇa has played this; therefore we shall do."" He can do anything. He can eat meat and He can eat the whole universe. That was shown to His mother: ""Mother, you are angry because I have eaten dirt. Now see within My mouth the whole universe is in. So what is the question of dirt and sea and ocean? I can eat everything."" [break] ...samnadoṣāya.Just like this sun. It dry up this urine. It is not infected. But you lick up this urine and let us see how powerful you are.Tejasaṁnadoṣāya.Who is powerful, he can do anything and everything, whatever he likes. You cannot do that. [break] ...example. This urine, within an hour it will be dried up. How it is dried up? Due to the sun. But the sun is not polluted. But you try to dry up and see the result."
Hari-śauri,Śrīla Prabhupāda? Wasn't it Lord Rāmacandra's purpose to actually display by His activity how a perfect human being should act?,Prabhupāda, Who said?
Hari-śauri,"Well, I understood that that verse,yadyadācaratiśreṣṭhas[Bg.3.21],that was referring to LordRāmacandra.",Prabhupāda," Everyone is referred, but whateverRāmacandrasays, you should do that. You should not imitate. There are two words: following and imitating. Imitation is not good. Following is good.Yadyadācaratizreṣ...You can... That I have already explained. Can you construct a bridge on the ocean? You are claiming,yadyadacarati. Can you do this? Then why do you say like that? You cannot imitate. You can follow only. ""BecauseRāmacandraate meat, so I am eating meat. I becomeRāmacandra."" And why don't you construct a bridge on the ocean?"
Akṣayānanda,"So actually, perfect kings, they may have eaten meat? Perfect kings...",Prabhupāda," No, perfect king must follow the Vedic injunction."
Akṣayānanda,"They would never eat meat, even though they arekṣatriyas.",Prabhupāda," No,kṣatriyasare allowed. That is by hunting, not otherwise. Oryajña.Everything is there in theśāstra.[break] ...candra, even He was eating meat, is there any instance in the templeRāmacandrais offered meat? Then why do you claim, ""Rāmacandra used to eat meat, therefore I shall eat""? All rascals.Kṛṣṇa, He ate fire,khāṇḍava-dāna.But what He asked you to offer? Does He says that ""You offer Me fire""? He says,patraṁpuṣpaṁphalaṁtoyaṁyo mebhaktyāprayacchati[Bg.9.26].Does He say that ""You give Me fire. I shall eat""?"
Akṣayānanda,You mean He eats fire in His representation as the fire-god?,Prabhupāda," No representation. As He is. He never assumed as fire-god. He was boy and playing, and there was fire and He ate it. That is God, not that He became a fire-god. What is fire-god? Thousands of fire-gods are staying on the nail of His feet. Why He should become a fire-god?Mahat-padam.Kṛṣṇa's another name ismahat-padam.The whole energy of material world is on His feet.Samāsrityepada-pallava-plavamahat-padapuṇya-yaśomurāreḥ.So they attendmaṅgala-arati?"
Guṇārṇava,Yes.,Prabhupāda, They do?
Devotee,"Yes, they do.",Prabhupāda, Very good. [break] ...there are cycles. The cycles are more dangerous than the motor car.
Haṁsadūta,Because you can't hear them.,Prabhupāda," No, no, hear... Gives you dash. You see? From the behind.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] ...God, they do like that. They give this example, ""In such and suchyajña, ṛṣiswere eating meat; therefore we shall eat meat."" In the Rāmakrishna Mission,sannyāsīs,they say like that. (end)"
Aksayānanda,"...fromAgracame yesterday, Prabhupāda. He wants to live with us. He knows Hindi. He's a teacher. He's a doctor. He's a writer. He's very, very nice. I'll bring him to you today.",Prabhupāda, He knows English also?
Aksayānanda,"English very well. Very humble and he wants to teach. If he can stay inVṛndāvanaI think it will be very, very beneficial for us.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Aksayānanda,Wonderful. I'll bring him this morning if it's all right.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Aksayānanda,"Jaya.He bows down. He paysdandavats.He said, ""You're asannyāsī,so I must respect. I'm only agṛhastha.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is the duty."
Aksayānanda,And he is also very intelligent. He's not just doing it out of sentiment. Very nice man. Older man.,Prabhupāda," If asannyāsīis not offered respect, the punishment is that he should fast one day. That is śāstric injunction."
Gunarnava,What is the punishment if one doesn't fast?,Prabhupāda, You must go to hell. (laughter) [break]
Aksayānanda,"...also come two or three times before over the months, so I know he is serious.",Prabhupāda, Let him come.
Aksayānanda,"Yes, he's very nice.",Prabhupāda, What is his age?
Aksayānanda,"I think he's about... He's getting on. He's fifty, sixty.",Prabhupāda, That is all right. Then he should retire.
Aksayānanda,"Yes. His wife has, I think, expired, so he has no problem there. And he looked in ourāśrama,and he likes it inside there. He's prepared to live withbrahmacārīsand so on. Very good man. His name is Mr.Ugrasena. [break] ...much colder today.",Prabhupāda," Yes, and it will increase. Yes. In December January it will be very cold."
Aksayānanda,Yes. It'll be almost twice as cold. [break],Prabhupāda," ...middle of January, there will be cloud, rain. You have no experience, last winter, anyone?Huh?"
Aksayānanda,"Yes, I have. Still, if we're sincere we'll stay inVṛndāvanaeven if blood and stool comes from the sky, if you want.",Prabhupāda," Why do you expect that? [break] ...capati, you apply little ghee?"
Aksayānanda,For the guests.,Prabhupāda, And not for you?
Aksayānanda,No.,Prabhupāda, Why?
Aksayānanda,Because it's very expensive and not necessary.,Prabhupāda, No.
Aksayānanda,"If you say it is necessary, we will do.",Prabhupāda," No, in this season it is necessary."
Aksayānanda,Very nice. We'll do. That is nice. A little more ghee should be there.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Aksayānanda,"A little more grain. Even little grain at night is all right, I think.",Prabhupāda," No, you must eat properly."
Aksayānanda,Yes. Then we'll do it.,Prabhupāda, And try to keep some cows.
Aksayānanda,Accha.,Prabhupāda," Yes. On the other land. Make a shed immediately and keep some cows. AndViśvambhara, he is experienced. He will help. [break] ...necessaryvairāgya,there is no need. We don't approve that.Yuktāhāra-vihārasca.What you require for keeping health but not to eat too much. But what is absolutely required must be done."
Aksayānanda,I heard that if you pass stool more than once a day you become abhogī?You are called abhogī?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Aksayānanda,Does that mean a serious devotee should only pass stool once a day?,Prabhupāda, Don't artificially do that. (laughter) First of all becomeyogi. Then do it.
Aksayānanda,"Yes. Of course, it can only be done by Kṛṣṇa's mercy, but one should at least try for that.",Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa.Jaya.Don't try for passing stool once. (laughter) That does not make you ayogi.
Bhavananda,Yogināmapisarveṣāṁmad-gatenāntarātmanā [Bg.6.47].,Prabhupāda," Antara...Yes. That makes youyogi, not by passing stool. (laughter)HareKṛṣṇa. [break]Huh?"
Harikesa,That will be it? The scientist and the egg?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikesa,Okay.,Prabhupāda, You know that? What is that article?
Aksayānanda,The one you heard last night?,Prabhupāda, No. When I was in South America I saw that...
Harikesa,South Africa.,Prabhupāda," South Africa. There are many factories for chicken killing. So I suggested that the egg, you can analyze, find out the chemicals and..."
Aksayānanda,Create one.,Prabhupāda, Create one egg. That was my proposal. So he is going to create. (laughter) He'll explain how to create egg from...
Aksayānanda; Jnana; Harikesa,"From chemicals.; And make chicken.; Calcium phosphate and a little sulphur for the yellow, make some color, and cover it in plastic and put it in an incubator and let a chicken grow.",Prabhupāda, And you eat.
Aksayānanda; Harikesa; Aksayānanda,"That will be a nice article.; And if they can, they can beat us on the face with shoes, and if they can't, we can beat them on the face with shoes.; Well, that's another thing. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...ly regret is that these rascals are going as scientists and big men. Simply talk. They cannot create. It is very simple thing. Put some chemicals together and if you know the chemicals, then why don't you put it? And incubator put, then you don't require to kill so many chicken. [break]"
Alanath; Prahupada; Alanath,"In Sweden when you go on the street and you preach, ""Everybody must suffer here,"" they don't believe because everybody got an apartment. They have never seen a poor man or a starving cow.; But he is himself a poor man.; In Sweden...",Prabhupāda, But he has no knowledge to understand it. Why he is falling down from the skyscraper and killing himself? Why? A poor man commits suicide. So if he is committing suicide he is a poor man. He is a poor man. He falsely thinking that he is rich man.
Alanath,We're printing now a book there with all the talks according to the scientists and according to the Christian philosophy what was lately in theBack to Godheadsin America.,Prabhupāda," Don't write anything nonsense. It must be very solid. Otherwise, you'll be laughing stock. What you'll say, it must..."
Alanath; Aksayānanda,"No, just the talks you make. Just your conversations.; Your lectures only.",Prabhupāda," Oh. That's all right. One must be confident before challenging others. Not that theoretical. Challenge is no good. In all stages he must be able to defend himself from the opposing elements. Then such challenge is all right. [break] We are confident that this soul cannot be manufactured by any material combination. Therefore we can challenge. And I can defend ourself in any stage. [break]Cānā,cānā?"
Aksayānanda,Channā?,Prabhupāda, Notcchanabutcānā. Cānaka dāhl?

Aksayānanda,Chick peadahlfor winter.,Prabhupāda," Mixed with littleuraḍ dāhl,then it will be very palatable and very beneficial."

Aksayānanda,Yes. Very good. [break] ...dāhlwill give you as much energy as eggs will any time.,Prabhupāda, Yes.

Harikesa,"Actually it's a wonderful challenge. This big, big scientist, big, big brain...",Prabhupāda," Big, big monkey. (laughter) ""Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy."""
Harikesa,And we walk in and put an egg in front of him.,Prabhupāda," You do not know this?Baro baro bandolel, baro baro peṭlaṅkādingate, matakare het.(?)(laughter) This translation was done by one big professor, of President's College, Professor Rowe. He was a big professor in the President's College. So these professors required to learn Bengali, so he translated, ""Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping melancholy."" [break]"
Alanath,There's some countries in Europe where they have absolute laws against selling books in the street. In these countries do we have to make something secret to sell your books?,Prabhupāda, Secret? Why?
Alanath,Because otherwise they would immediately put you in prison.,Prabhupāda, Where? Here in India?
Alanath,"No. In Europe, like in Switzerland. But when we go there for selling books people take them like anything, but you have to hide before the police very carefully.",Prabhupāda, Why? Why don't you take permission from the court?
Alanath; Akṣayānanda; Alanath,No. It's not possible.; Have you applied?; They have very strict laws. It's also been applied for.,Prabhupāda," No, you have to prove: ""This is very important book of knowledge, so allow us a special."""
Alanath; Akṣayānanda; Alanath,"It's especially different if foreigners try to sell a book there. And we have... Like in Austria we have no Austrian devotees there.; They think it's an invasion.; Yes. We used to go there sometimes, and it was very good. People took many many books, but sometimes they caught us, so...",Prabhupāda," No, if they caught, go to the jail and when there is trial you should explain that ""This is very important book. The government should allow to sell."""
Alanath,"If the policemen liked us, but the law is strict.",Prabhupāda," Therefore you have to take defense from the law. You present in the court the professors' opinion, how they are giving standing order. Why the state should restrain distributing knowledge? Do they want to keep their men in darkness? You have to preach like that. [break]...University is the most important university in Europe. They read our books. They order standing order. So why this loafer state prohibit?"
Alanath,"...these explanations, they always argue, ""If we allow you to sell your books, then we must allow everybody to sell on the street.""",Prabhupāda, No. But you must consider the importance of... [break] Everybody submits application for becoming high-court judge. Will it be granted? There must be discrimination. [break] Thank you very much for your kindness. Yes. I am very pleased. Thank you. (end)
Akṣayānanda,Sometimes I think our big building is too much Westernized. Disturbs the atmosphere.,Prabhupāda, Hm.
Akṣayānanda,"Like you wrote in theCaitanya-caritāmṛtathat whenCaitanyaMahāprabhuhad many disciples behind him, He was criticized that He should not take them toVṛndāvana. It might disturb the nice atmosphere. We have to be careful that we don't disturb with our big buildings and things. [break]",Prabhupāda, ...transform into a nice park this space. [break]

Harikesa,[break]...and went back to civilized life. (Hindi) (end),Prabhupāda," The rascals should not do that. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says,nāmāśrayakarithākahaāpanakārye.You do your work but take shelter ofhari-nama.That is wanted."

Akṣayānanda,I was recently told by one devotee that theācāryadoes not have to be a pure devotee.,Prabhupāda, What?
Akṣayānanda,That theācāryadoes not have to be a pure devotee.,Prabhupāda, Who is that rascal?
Akṣayānanda,"Well, he said it. Who said it?",Prabhupāda, Who said? Who is that rascal? Theācāryadoes not require to be a pure devotee?
Akṣayānanda,"He said it.Nitāisaid it. He said it in this context. He said that Lord Brahm is theācāryain theBrahma-sampradāya,but yet he is sometimes afflicted by passion. So therefore he is saying that it appears that theācāryadoes not have to be a pure devotee. So it does not seem right.",Prabhupāda, So who is that rascal? I want to know who has said.
Akṣayānanda; Harikeśa,Nitāi.Nitāidāsa.; Nitāisaid that?,Prabhupāda, Who isNitāidāsa?
Harikeśa; Akṣayānanda,OurNitāi.; Nitāi.,Prabhupāda," Oh, ourNitāi? Oh."
Akṣayānanda,"He said he couldn't understand it, but he thought, he said that he thought...",Prabhupāda, He manufactured his idea. Therefore he's a rascal. Therefore he's a rascal.Nitāihas become an authority?
Akṣayānanda,"No, actually he said that he thought...",Prabhupāda," He thought something rascaldom, and he is expressing that. Therefore he is more rascal. These things are going on. As soon as he reads some books, he becomes anācārya,whatever rascal he may be."
Akṣayānanda,So there's no doubt that Lord Brahm is a pure devotee?,Prabhupāda," Whatever he may be, he isācārya.So you...

Indian man,"But the rascal philosophers, they have put in their book that you don't need to go to a spiritual master. Like one lady, she is staying in our temple now. She is a life member from, I think from Kanpur. So I was discussing with her yesterday. She said that ""Your devotees, they are forcing me,"" that she should accept Śrīla Prabhupāda as spiritual master. She said, ""No. I knowKṛṣṇa. I am readingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.""

Indian man,"He don't give any commentary on verses, even important commentary, he speak all nonsense.",Prabhupāda," No, therefore you say, ""This head is not required. You are talking nonsense,"" and cut his head."

Devotee (2),"Yes, he is beingguru. He is teaching them to do without aguru.",Prabhupāda, Let everyone become hisguru. Why you write books?
Indian man,...one book that one should not write a book without the permission of a spiritual master.,Prabhupāda," Yes.

And from the lesson we understand you are rascal number one."" That's all."
Indian man,"Tilaka's(?) wife, she told me... She was very upset you know. One day she, when she came to see you and that one rascalyogiwas there and he said that in the Vedas everything is mentioned that we can drink and woman and the man have equal right. Then you answered her, and she was also saying the same thing and you answered her, ""Okay, if woman and the man have equal right, then why not your husband begot the children... Why not you begot the children in the womb of your husband?"" And she was very upset, you know. She said, ""Prabhupāda sometimes say the things like that which are unreasonable, you know.""",Prabhupāda," It may require... No, I said that ""If you are equal rights, then make some arrangement: sometimes you become pregnant; sometimes he becomes pregnant. Why there is not right, equal right?"""
Indian man; Devotee (2),"She was telling me when... She... I said that ""Prabhupāda sometimes says these things that we feel all ashamed, you know, because...""; The medicine is not always palatable for these people.",Prabhupāda," But in speaking spiritual understanding we cannot make any compromise. What to speak of in Mauritius, in Chicago I told. There was great agitation in papers."
Harikeśa; Indian man; Devotee (2),"In the TV, on television.; Same thing?; In France also.",Prabhupāda," They were very upset. And when I was coming, I think, in Chicago, in the airplane, one of the host girl, she was seeing... (laughter) I asked her to supply one 7-up. And, ""I have no key."" She was so angry. But all the captains and others, they gathered around me. (laughter)"
Harikeśa,"I think that was the same stewardess who came in the back and asked us, ""Why the Swamiji doesn't like women?""",Prabhupāda," No, no, I don't say that I don't like women, but I cannot say that equal rights. How can I say? First of all show that you equal rights—your husband becomes sometimes pregnant and then you become pregnant, alternately."
Akṣayānanda,That doesn't mean you don't like them.,Prabhupāda," No, it is truth. I am speaking the truth, that ""If you have equal right, then let your husband become pregnant. Make some arrangement."""
Harikeśa,"Viśākhāwas preaching to her. She said that ""Actually we are less intelligent."" (laughter) That started a big scandal...",Prabhupāda," Yes. And that isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. [break] They are in equal right, then... Nowadays, of course, they are thinking like that, that man should remain independent, and they'll have homosex, and the woman also independent and they will make some... This is most immoral things."
Indian man,If only people think that they have equal right...,Prabhupāda," Where is equal right? Even in Russia there is no equal rights. They have created some of them are managers, and some of them are workers. Why? If equal rights, then everyone should be manager."
Harikeśa,"Well, in America they have women senators now.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Harikeśa; Indian man,"Women senators, women are in charge of companies sometimes.; No, in India there are two women. They are high commissioners of India to the foreign countries.",Prabhupāda," No, that is possible. That it requires education. That is another... By nature the woman's body is different from man's."
Indian man,Women are subordinate.,Prabhupāda," Not subordinate actually. The occupations are different. It does not mean... That is another mistake. Just like the leg is walking, and the head is directing, so although the occupation is different, both of them are important. We require the head and leg also. If simply head is there, if there is no leg, then who'll walk? This is the understanding, not equal. Everyone must have his separate duties to serve the whole. That is the arrangement. This is real understanding. The most important part of the body is head, but that does not mean the leg is not important. Leg is important in its work, and head is important in its work. So we require both, head and tail both, not that simply leg or simply head. But when we make comparative study, we can understand that head is more important than the leg. If you cut your leg, you can live, but if you cut your head, you'll die. Therefore the conclusion is: head is more important than the leg. Comparative study. Otherwise head is also required and leg is also required. You collect some flowers, nice flowers, and, add with it some green foliage, it becomes more beautiful. Simply flower is not so beautiful. When it is arrayed with some green foliage, then it becomes more beautiful. So we have to take in that sense. But comparatively, the flower is more important than the foliage. But the both of them are required."
Harikeśa,The foliage also becomes beautiful because of the flower.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is God's creation. Just like these trees. They are condemned, but still, with trees we can make a beautiful garden and that is very enjoyable. That is God's arrangement. Even insignificant... Kṣūdrādapipradhānasyajāyateparamaṁhitam. One is very insignificant and other is very important, but both of them combined together becomes beneficial. [break]"
Viśāla,"I remember over five years ago you telling me about, ""If you read the first nine cantos ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,you become fullyKṛṣṇaconscious."" Would you kindly tell me what does it mean to be fullyKṛṣṇaconscious?",Prabhupāda," What do you understand, fullyKṛṣṇaconscious?"
Viśāla,What does it mean to be fullyKṛṣṇaconscious?,Prabhupāda," No, what you mean, first of all let me know."
Harikeśa; Viśāla,What do you think fullyKṛṣṇaconcious means? You tell Prabhupāda.; It's to seeKṛṣṇaface to face?,Prabhupāda," That meansKṛṣṇaconscious? Everyone is seeingKṛṣṇaface to face. When you go to the templeKṛṣṇais there, and you are seeing. Does it mean everyone isKṛṣṇaconscious?"
Viśāla,No.,Prabhupāda, Then what is the meaning ofKṛṣṇaconscious?
Indian man,Brahma-bhūtaḥprasannātmānaśocatinakāṅkṣati[Bg.18.54].,Prabhupāda," Hm, that is part ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness,brahṁabhūtaḥ.RealKṛṣṇaconsciousness is: ""Kṛṣṇa is master, I am servant."" This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Viśāla,To understand that you're the servant andKṛṣṇais the master. I see.,Prabhupāda," When you fully understand, that is yourKṛṣṇa... That isKṛṣṇaconscious. [break] So long you think that ""I can also become likeKṛṣṇa,"" then you are notKṛṣṇaconscious."
Viśāla,"In other words, if you still have material desires you can't be fullyKṛṣṇaconscious.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is the beginning ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness,anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam[Brs.1.1.11].Make all your material desires zero."
Viśāla,Thank you very much.,Prabhupāda, That isKṛṣṇaconscious. You should only desire to serveKṛṣṇa. [break] ...clear or not?
Viśāla; Harikeśa,"Very clear. Thank you very much.; What if a person doesn't desire material enjoyment, but still, there is so much dirt?",Prabhupāda, Hm? Who is that person who has no material desires?
Harikeśa,"A person really wants to beKṛṣṇaconscious, but somehow or another, so much dirts gets in the way.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Dirt means it is not yet zero. I said that all material desires should be made zero.Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam[Brs.1.1.11].
Harikeśa,"As soon as the desires completely change, then everything else is purified.",Prabhupāda," Yes. AsArjunasaid,kariṣyevacanatava, naṣṭomohaḥ: ""Now my illusion is over. I agree to act as you say."" This isKṛṣṇaconscious.Naṣṭomohasmṛtir labdhtvatprasādānmadhusūdana.[break] Themohais there.Mohameans these desires are illusion, like dreaming. In dream we see so many things. They are all false. In dreaming I am seeing that somebody is coming to kill me but there is nobody, but still, I am dreaming. This is calledmoha.So when one is free frommoha,then he'sKṛṣṇaconscious. The whole material world is going on under such illusion. Therefore it is calledmāyā.HareKṛṣṇa. Thank you. (end)"

Akṣayānanda Swami,No. That's what I thought. I wasn't sure about that.,Prabhupāda, Why they want to join?
Akṣayānanda Swami,"Because in their centers there's no, there doesn't seem to be so much transcendental activity like you have given us. They don't get that. And if they come and see us they see the devotees are dancing and happy and engaged. The conditions are clean and so on...",Prabhupāda," So, you can try one or two. If you find that they're alright..."
Akṣayānanda Swami,Yes. Doesn't matter.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (pause) We can purchase some of those fields but where is the man? We can grow our own food.

Harikeśa,Well we know how they interact. We may not know how they got here but we know what they do once they are here.,Prabhupāda," No... Knowledge means to find out the source. That is knowledge.

Smarahari,They say there are many suns... but...,Prabhupāda," That's alright. Make you one sun, if you know! Many suns but you have not made anyone of them. You just try to make one, then I shall see your intelligence.Huh? What do you say? Anybody?"

If you have not enough power there must be somebody powerful than you—you have to admit that—who has made all these things. But you are rascal you have not... You are simply, ahh, what is called? Speculating. That in future we shall be powerful. But the powerful is already there. What is your credit? More powerful-) you cannot conceive even how powerful He a scientist.Huh? Is that alright? What is your value? The already powerful is there, who has manufactured these things. And you are expecting in future you'll be powerful; therefore you are more powerful. Just see their folly. If you are powerful then make it, another imitation sun."

Devotee (2),"Scientists aren't very intelligent because today he big thing in the country politically is that whole world thinks they are running out of energy on one hand, and on the other hand the whole world believes that the scientists can solve all the problems and get to know the absolute truth but if they...",Prabhupāda, They are creating problems.
Devotee (2),"Yes, they're creating problems.",Prabhupāda," (sounds of lots of birds in background) (stops) Birds and beasts, they're living without any scientists—they're more happy."
Harikeśa,But they're freezing in the cold and they're...,Prabhupāda," No, no one is freezing. That is you are speaking but they are not freezing. Even int the coldest part of the country, Greenland, the animals are living quite nicely. The birds and many animals."
Hari-śauri,"But if we preach like that to them, then they'll say 'then what's wrong with becoming an animal then'?",Prabhupāda," Huh? But you are less than an animal. Talking nonsense. Put forward the problems, summarisejanma-mṛtyu-jar-vyādhisolve these problems."
Harikeśa,Well we can solve the problem of birth by just killing all the children.,Prabhupāda," (laughing) That is not solving, the birth is already there, therefore you are killing. (everyone laughing)"
Akṣayānanda Swami,Birth is still there.,Prabhupāda, No. Because there is birth therefore you are killing. So birth problem is not solved.
Harikeśa,"No, no, no. We're killing before birth.",Prabhupāda, What is this before birth. The child is already there... mother's womb.
Harikeśa,It's a lump.,Prabhupāda, ...they cannot understand. Does a dead child grow? Simply speaking nonsense!
Harikeśa,That's their whole argument for abortion.,Prabhupāda, That's alright but...
Harikeśa,You just finished it! (laughing),Prabhupāda," ...but our point is, the birth problem is not solved. If there are unwanted population, you kill them that does not mean the population problem is solved."
Hari-śauri,They're not actually seeing the actual causes of the problems.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Hari-śauri,They're not actually seeing the causes of the problems so they're trying to adjust to them.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Hari-śauri,They're simply trying to make so many adjustments to the problems but they are not solving the cause.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That adjustment is not solution.
Akṣayānanda Swami,"You said once, putting the weight from your head to your shoulder.",Prabhupāda, Ha?
Akṣayānanda Swami,"You are carrying a heavy weight I remember you said once. You're carrying heavy weight here, to take the pain you put it here. Then again back here. But still the weight is there.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,The scientists came up with another one for enjoyment. That they cut this little cord that makes the sperm come into the semen and in this way they can have sex life like anything and they're actually not killing. (Man shouts greeting in background),Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa.Jai!Jaya.Semen, what is that?"
Harikeśa,"Well they say anyway, that... into the semen so they cut this little cord, that tube or something, that has the semen go into the sperm, so the sperm never gets into the semen. So therefore they can have sex life but they'll be no reproduction.",Prabhupāda," So one may check, two may check, what about millions? Supposing they can check in that way, it may be possible for one or two, or a dozen, but what about millions and millions? Nature's way."
Harikeśa,"That's if they, they're doing this in...",Prabhupāda, In future. That will solve in future.
Harikeśa,They were giving prizes to people who are doing this.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Like TV sets.,Prabhupāda," Mutual 'present' society. (everyone laughing) (front bell of temple ringing as Prabhupāda enters grounds) Hiraṇyakaśipu civilization, and we are presentingPrahlādacivilization. So this is a struggle, but ultimatelyPrahlādawill come out triumphant.HareKṛṣṇa(to bystander) and Hiraṇyakaṣipu will be killed.Jaya!(Walks into temple) (end)."
Harikeśa; Akṣayānanda; Harikeśa,"We can see there's life in the air, there are fishes in the water and birds in the air. And in the earth there are so many worms and crabs and things like that. We see life in these forms but why is it not true that we can see life in fire? We can't see life in fire because we haven't the experience. But because there's life in...; If you don't have the experience, it doesn't mean there's no life.; Because there's life...",Prabhupāda, Hm? Hm?
Akṣayānanda,Because we have not experienced it doesn't mean that there's no life.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That I have already explained. That, you'll see in big, big factories, there is fire. Flame is coming. By seeing the flame, if you think there is no life, is that not nonsense?"
Harikeśa,"Oh, you gave the example last night of...",Prabhupāda," So many example. You go to theTatairon factory, from distance you'll see so many fire flames. Does it mean there is no life? That is nonsense."
Akṣayānanda,Another point is somebody had to light the fire.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Akṣayānanda,"Somebody must havelitthat fire. So similarly the light of the sun, who has started that light?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Akṣayānanda,"Somebody has started that light, that fire.",Prabhupāda, So in this way the nonsense scientists are going on. What do you think? Eh?
Harikeśa; Akṣayānanda,"So this idea of friction causing electricity, so is electricity—this electrical energy—the source of fire? That's what the scientists think sometimes too, that the lightning bolt came down and made a fire. And that was man's first experience of fire as a caveman.; So where did the lightning bolt come from?",Prabhupāda," Yes. How the lightning was manufactured, rascal?"
Harikeśa,"Well, there were some positive charges in the clouds and some negative charges in the ground.",Prabhupāda, That's alright. Who made that positive charge and negative charge?
Akṣayānanda,So let them manufacture lightning bolts in theTatafactory.,Prabhupāda," How the electricity is produced unless there is some arrangement? Just put counter-argument and argument, try to understand. You have to preach. So your argument stopped?"
Harikeśa,I don't know anything about this. (laughter),Prabhupāda," You cannot... Yourmalador masjid(?).Arguments are there, so whether there is life in the sun globe?"
Indian man,"(Hindi—discussion with Śrīla Prabhupāda and other Indian men aboutśāstra,scientists,agni,and the example of the iron factory)",Prabhupāda, Jaya.
Devotees; Harikeśa,HareKṛṣṇa!; But the fire and the life is different in theTatafactory.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,The fire is different from the life. The fire is produced.,Prabhupāda, The fire is the same. There is fire. Fire is the same. In the life the fire is not different.
Harikeśa,"No, what I mean to say in the example, that the people are there and the fire is also there...",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Harikeśa,"So, in a...",Prabhupāda, Exactly the same way. In the factory there is big fire and there are workers also.
Harikeśa,But the life is the workers not the fire.,Prabhupāda," No. I mean to say, in the midst of fire, the living entity can live. That is my argument."
Akṣayānanda,But they can't jump in the fire and live. They will die.,Prabhupāda," No. That is material body. Spiritual... In theBhagavad-gītāthere is, (it says that) it does not burn into fire, in the fire.Adāhyaḥ,adāhyaḥ.So living entity is never burnt. Even if he's in the fire. So he may have a body of fire but he does not burn."
Akṣayānanda,"But why should we accept that, because to make our factory we did not needBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Akṣayānanda,To make our factory we did not needBhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Akṣayānanda,"To make the factory... We have made such a nice factory for fire, so we did not need to consultBhagavad-gītāfor that.",Prabhupāda, I do not follow what he is saying.
Harikeśa,He's saying he built a factory but he didn't useBhagavad-gītāto do it.,Prabhupāda, So who says that withoutBhagavad-gītāyou cannot ignite fire?
Akṣayānanda,So why should we accept that the living entity will not die.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that is authority. If you do not accept, then this is the example, argument. That the factory surrounded by fire, it does not mean there is no life. From distance, you are seeing the sun from a very, very, 95 or 93 million miles away. Fiery it is undoubtedly, but it is exactly like that: that you see from a distant place, the iron factory, it is simply fiery. Your experience is from distance. You have not gone there. So the distance experience is like this, that you see there is fire, big fire, but still there are life. You have to accept this argument."
Harikeśa,Actually it is perfectly reasonable.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,In the fire there's fiery bodies.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,But then that must mean in the water there's watery bodies.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"And earth, earthy bodies.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is God's creation. Take, take out one fish, within five minutes, he'll die. And you put yourself in the water, within five minutes you will die. But you are living entity, he is also living entity. His external body is different, your external body is different."
Harikeśa,But my body is ninety percent water.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,My body is ninety per cent water. The scientists say that this material body is ninety percent water.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Human body. So I've got a watery body...,Prabhupāda, Ninety percent water?
Harikeśa,That's what they say.,Prabhupāda," They say. They are rascals. (laughter) So much bones and flesh and so many things, others. And ninety percent water."
Harikeśa,"Well, they take a cell and they say in the cell...",Prabhupāda," ""They take,"" they... Don't quote them, they are all rascals. You come to your own reason. They say, then you accept them as authority. Then why don't you accept authority ofBhagavad-gītā,rascal? You are quoting some rascals and fools, and I am quoting fromBhagavad-gītā.Then whose quotation is favorable? ""They say."" And when we say, ""Kṛṣṇa says,"" that is nothing! Just see, how foolish. ""They say."" These rascals, meat eaters,huh? Bachelor daddies, (laughter) they say something, that is authority. And (if)Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says, (then) ""Oh, that we cannot accept."" Just see nonsense. That I... This argument I put forward with Professor Kotovsky that, ""After all, we have to follow leader. So your leader is Lenin. And my leader isKṛṣṇa. So where is the difference between the process? You have to accept some authority. Now it is to be seen whether Lenin is perfect orKṛṣṇais perfect. That is another thing, but you have to follow some authority. So you are stopped."""
Harikeśa,But in science...,Prabhupāda, Again science.
Harikeśa,"No, as far as the process goes, they are very proud of the fact that there's no authority.",Prabhupāda," But why you are following? Why you are quoting Newton? You are quoting this scientist, that scientist, why you are quoting?"
Harikeśa; Harikeśa,"Well, Newtonsatthere, and saw the apple falling...Prabhupāda:If you don't follow authority, then why you quote so many previous scientists? What is the use of quoting if there is no authority?; But the trend is, because Newton speculated the law of gravity...",Prabhupāda," No, no, first of all you settle up. Don't go away from the point. (laughter) The point is that there is no need of authority. Then why you quote this scientist, that scientist? You stop this nonsense. There is no authority. Hm?"
Harikeśa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Haṁsadūta?
Haṁsadūta,Hm.,Prabhupāda," If there is no authority, why do you quote so many rascals? Then come to reason, argument, that's all. If you quote authority, I have got my authority."
Harikeśa,So this fire... That makes sense.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Harikeśa,"This fire, it makes sense. That there's life in fire.",Prabhupāda," Yes. This is argument. When you do not accept authority, there must be reason and argument."
Harikeśa,But this ether thing is very troublesome.,Prabhupāda, Troublesome for you! (laughter)
Harikeśa,Yes. You said sound is in the ether.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,But I couldn't understand how air...,Prabhupāda, You have to gain that intelligence.
Harikeśa,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Sound is the proof that there is ether.Śabda.Now, I am talking, you are hearing. How you are hearing? Ethereal transportation. Otherwise how you can hear? I am talking here, and why you are hearing? This is ethereal. The sound is being produced, somehow or other the ether is passing, just (like) tele... What is called? Radio."
Harikeśa,"They heard, people on the earth, talking on the moon.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"So it went through the air, it went through the space, sounds.",Prabhupāda," The moon (astronaut) says that ""There is no life."" Then who is speaking? Nonsense. (laughter) They talk in the moon, and they hear from here, and ""There is no life."" And we have to take these authorities. (laughter)"
Akṣayānanda,I remember once you said that we may not live in the water but that doesn't mean there's no such thing as a fish.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Akṣayānanda; Harikeśa,"So that is also a very good argument. I remember you gave that one.; So the air is coming from the ether, so...",Prabhupāda, Because in the air there is sound. Therefore ether is there. It is a production of the ether.
Harikeśa,"So would it be beneficial to try to understand the process of production? Like the example of the earth coming from the water. Because the water evaporates, there is left over minerals and salts and all these things...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"And the fire producing the water from excess heat. Like in the summer season and then the monsoon comes. And fire from air, from the friction generating electric current. But the air from the ether needs an example.",Prabhupāda," Air from the ether because when the air blows, you find the sound, sshhhh. That is ether."
Hari-śauri; Harikeśa,"Yeah, like some...; But the example's got to go the other way. From the ether comes the air.",Prabhupāda," That you found out, example. But this is the proof there is ether within the air. That example is given many times inBhagavad-gītā."
Passerby,Haribol!,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa!
Haṁsadūta,Does it mean beyond the ether there's no sound?,Prabhupāda," Beyond the ether there is mind, there is mind."
Haṁsadūta,There's no sound?,Prabhupāda," No, what is the sound of the mind? Everyone knows you have mind, I have mind, but where is the sound of the mind?"
Harikeśa,There's subtle and the gross has no realm in the subtle?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is finer."
Harikeśa,"So is that example of the space, then the thinner air, and the air, and the water, and the earth, and in between electricity...",Prabhupāda," The grosser, grosser..."
Harikeśa,Is that a good example?,Prabhupāda," Everything is coming from the subtle form, finer. Finer than the ether is the mind, and finer than the mind is intelligence."
Harikeśa,"Oh, and in theBhāgavatamit also says that because the universal form desired to hear, that sound was created and then the organ for hearing. Like that.",Prabhupāda, That is also created.
Harikeśa,So...,Prabhupāda," Just like from ether, sound is created.Śabda,sparśa. Śabda,sparśa,rūpa,rasa,gandhaḥ,these are the fiveparmatra(?), object of sense perception.Budh,pañcaparmatra,ten senses, the mind, and three modes, the material nature. This is the ingredient of the whole creation."
Harikeśa,So the basic element is the soul's...,Prabhupāda, Basic element isKṛṣṇa.
Harikeśa,And then the spirit soul's desire.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,AndKṛṣṇafulfills everyone's desire.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta; Harikeśa,By manipulating the energy.; So the most subtle form...,Prabhupāda, He is also... The living entity is creating different body for different enjoyment.
Haṁsadūta,The living entity?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,But he can't do it withoutKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," That is, he is subordinate."
Haṁsadūta,"Just like our hair grows, but we don't know how it's happening.",Prabhupāda, It is sanctioned.Mattaḥsarvaṁpravartate.Everything fromKṛṣṇa.
Harikeśa,Is the most subtle form of creation the desire of the living entity to enjoy this material world?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,And thenKṛṣṇa...,Prabhupāda, Supplies ingredients. Yes.
Harikeśa,"So that desire, that is equivalent, or is that the...",Prabhupāda," A child wants to play, and the father and mother gives the toys for that play. So without getting help from the father and mother, the child cannot enjoy. Similarly, we may desire but unlessKṛṣṇahelps us we cannot fulfill our desire."
Harikeśa,Is desire a function of consciousness?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Unless there is desire, how it is living? It is dead body. Stone, stone has no desire."
Harikeśa,The spirit soul is...,Prabhupāda," Therefore, spirit soul is described as superior energy. He desires and he manipulates the matter.Yayedaṁdhāryatejagat[Bg.7.5]."
Harikeśa,"It's very logical, step by step by step by step. Actually when it's seen from the point of view of the desire of the living entity, it makes perfect sense because he's got these senses and the sound, and then in order to hear, there has to be a vehicle for the sound, and then there has to be an instrument. And then in order to touch there has to be the vehicle and the...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"So therefore, from that point of view, it's very logical.",Prabhupāda," This is the point, you have to..."
Harikeśa,Trying to do it the other way is impossible. From the...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee; Harikeśa,I don't know if that's the right word.; Inductive reasoning? Deductive reasoning. Impossible.,Prabhupāda," Deductive reason is possible.Kṛṣṇasays thatnajāyatenamriyatevā.This is deductive: you hear fromKṛṣṇa, and this is fact. And if you want to make research, how that living entity never takes birth, then it will take time and at the same it may not be perfect."
Harikeśa,I finally understood why you were always talking toSvarūpaDāmodaraabout inductive and deductive reasoning.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Because it's just not possible to go the other way.,Prabhupāda, By inductive reason you cannot reach the truth perfectly.
Harikeśa,Because it's beyond the material creation and you have to use the material senses and mind to understand. It's not possible.,Prabhupāda," Therefore, our point is deductive. WhatKṛṣṇasays, that is perfect."
Harikeśa,So first prove the existence of God and the existence of the spirit soul...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,"...and then, they'll just have to explain...",Prabhupāda, And then it's creation.
Harikeśa,And that it's creation. They'll just have to accept they have desires.,Prabhupāda," Ahamevāsam evāgre.This is theBhāgavata'sfirst instruction toBrahma.Ahamevāsamagre.Agremeans in the beginning. So in the beginningKṛṣṇawas there, then creation took place. Similarly in the beginning of this body, ""I am spirit soul,"" was there. Then the body comes out. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais there, therefore the whole cosmic manifestation has come about.Ahamevāsamagre.And at the end of the creation,Kṛṣṇais there. Similarly at the end of this body, I am there. Again I'll create another body. This is going on."
Harikeśa,It's Kṛṣṇa's trick just to give us this facility.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Harikeśa,This is Kṛṣṇa's trick just to give us facility.,Prabhupāda," And because I wanted it.Kṛṣṇadoesn't want it. But because you are rascals we wanted it.Kṛṣṇa(says,) ""Alright, do it."""
Harikeśa,"So therefore, in the beginningKṛṣṇagives you the big post,Brahmā.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Now you're in charge of creating a whole universe.,Prabhupāda," Yes. If you want lord it over, ""Alright you becomeBrahma."" He gives so much facility."
Harikeśa,"And then thisBrahmācreates so many different desires, and then he goes through all the different bodies.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Akṣayānanda,Everyone becomesBrahmāfirst?,Prabhupāda, Hm? Yes. Or if you want to be a cat you can become.
Harikeśa,How can they say this isn't science? This is so incredible.,Prabhupāda," Desire is there. Desire is there. Just like in your country, the nudism going on. The desire is, ""Ah, I shall remain free, naked."" SoKṛṣṇais giving you facility, ""Alright, you stand here for thousands of years as tree, naked, nobody will criticize. You want to remain naked on the public street and you want to enjoy in that way, alright you become tree."""
Harikeśa,"Because desire is a function of consciousness, which is a symptom of the spirit soul, it's very powerful.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,Because it's spiritual actually.,Prabhupāda," Therefore it is said,anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam[Brs.1.1.11]. Abhilāṣmeans desire.Anyameans ""except service ofKṛṣṇa."" That is beginning ofbhakti.As soon as he desires something material for enjoyment he has to come to Me.Manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].The mind and the senses; with these things he is struggling for existence. Otherwise he is part and parcel of Krs...,mamaivāṁśojīva-bhutaḥjīva-lokasanātana[Bg.15.7].He is eternal but because he is influenced by the mind, desires, and the senses, sense enjoyment, he is struggling. This is it, a struggle. So when he is too much fatigued,Kṛṣṇacomes and gives you good counsel. ""You rascal give up these all desires. Surrender to Me, I give you protection."" But he'll not do that. And if he agrees thenanyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam[Brs.1.1.11],all material desires, zero. Thenbhaktibegins. And if you have got a little pinch of material desires, then you have to accept different types of body. It will create, naturally.Kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya [Bg.13.22].He is desiring under the influence of particular modes of nature, and he's getting body."
Harikeśa,One has to be very careful.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Otherwise even a devotee likeBhārataMahārāja, he had to accept the body of a deer. A little careless. Then nature's law will act. Hm? If you do not become cautious and if you infect the smallpox disease, you have to suffer. Therefore a civilized man takes process, caution, ""Oh there is smallpox disease, I shall not go there. Or if I go there, I must take vaccine."" This is human civilization, caution. And if you are animal, you do not know. So human life means not animal life. Very reasonable, very cautious, educated, cultured, that is human life. Not animal life. Drink like animal, or eat like animal, have sex life like animal. Freedom, animal has got all freedom. So that freedom is not allowed to the human beings. That is civilization. The same example. The animal has got freedom and you'll see in Indian market, vegetable market, some cow comes and eats, takes so many vegetables and eats, but he's not going to the court. But if you take one small piece of chili without, then you'll go to the court. So therefore, law is meant for human beings, not for the animals. Those who want to be free, they are animals. So-called freedom means animalism. That is not humanism. Humanism means to follow the rules and regulations and the laws, and then he is human being. Because law is meant for the human being, not for the animals. And when you come out from your home, immediately the law is keep to the right. And if you violate, immediately you go to the law. But a dog, he doesn't care. If you say, ""A dog does not obey this law,"" that is no excuse. You are human being. If you don't obey then you go to jail. So many animals are on the street naked, they're having sex life, naked. You do, immediately you'll be prosecuted. Why? Because you are a human being. You have to restrain. Even if you like. Just like the Hawaii University students, ""What is the wrong to become a dog?"" So if you think like that then you become a dog, nature is ready to give you a dog's body. That is (Sanskrit). He's thinking, ""The dog's life is very nice. This liberation of sex life on the street."" ""Alright, you take dog's body.""Yaṁyaṁvā...Bhāvam...ah, what is that?"
Harikeśa,Smaranbhāvam.,Prabhupāda, Ha.Tyajantyantekalevaram.
Caitya-guru,Taṁtam evaitikaunteya.,Prabhupāda," Ha. ""So you are thinking like dog, alright you take the body of a dog."" And finished. Your human life is finished. And again wait for millions of years to come to the human form of life. Nature's law you cannot check.Daivīhieṣāguṇa-mayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].The law is there. The same example, if you contaminate some disease, the law is you must suffer from that disease. So they are thinking ""free."" That is their gross ignorance."
Hari-śauri,It's very important then to accept sometapasya.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hari-śauri,It's very important to accept sometapasyato purify your desires.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes, that is, that requirestapasya.Tapodivyam[SB5.5.1].Tapasyameans to purify the desire.Tatparatvenanirmalam[Cc.Madhya19.170].Therefore if you simply keep your desires to the service ofKṛṣṇa, you become purified."
Passerby,"(singing)Govindahari,gopāla.Harerjayajaya,prabhudinadayalahari.",Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa!
Passerby,"(carries on singing on his way)Govindajaya,gopālajaya...",Prabhupāda, This declaration of freedom is animal. Animal freedom.
Passerby,"HareKṛṣṇa,HareRāma.",Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa! Thank you. They are struggling for false freedom. This is not freedom. This is becoming entangled. And when we voluntarily give up all freedom, ""This is all nonsense!Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto you.""Bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavān[Bg.7.19],then he's really wise. When he fully surrenders toKṛṣṇa."
Caitya-guru,"Then he knows,Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].",Prabhupāda," Yes. Otherwise how he'll surrender. He must be convinced thatKṛṣṇais everything, so let me surrender toKṛṣṇa. Then he is wise. Otherwise he is an animal."
Harikeśa,A really wise person could understand that there's no choice but to surrender.,Prabhupāda, Yes. He must. He is already under the control.
Harikeśa,He's always controlled at every moment.,Prabhupāda," Yes. But he's... He prefers to be controlled by the laws of nature instead of byKṛṣṇa. That is his misfortune. He is controlled, but he thinks, ""I am free."" That is ignorance.Mūḍha.Just like I am the state citizen. I am not free. I must work according to the state laws. But he (thinks), ""I shall... I don't care for government."" That is my foolishness. You have to care. At home I can say to my wife, ""I don't care for government, I don't care for the police."" But when there is crime, when the police comes, then he says ""Ohh."" (pulls asadface-laughter) He can be very much proud before his wife, ""I don't care for anything."" But when the police comes, ""What can I do?"" (Hindi) There is an example that the, what is called,mūrgī?What you call? Toast? No. Host? No. What is called?Mūrgī, mūrgī?Chicken? The male, male?"
Akṣayānanda; Haṁsadūta,Rooster.; Rooster.,Prabhupāda, Rooster?
Woman,Cock?,Prabhupāda," Yes. So the, when in the morning, it is let loose, then he says, ""I don't care for any hahaa, cawcaw."" Then in the evening, when they are pushed into the, that what is called? Nest? ""Cawcawcawcaw. Whatever you like you can do, whatever you like you can do."" (laughter) This is the example. You see? When he's under the arrest, ""Now sir, whatever you like, you do with me. If you like you can excuse me."" (laughter) And when he's out, ""I don't care for anyone.""Mūrgīintelligence. Rooster intelligence. This is our proposal. ""I don't care for anyone. I am God.""Mūrgīlogic.Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāmanorathenāsati dhāvatobahiḥ[SB5.18.12],if one is not a devotee, his only business is to remain on the mental platform and concoct things. And at the end he thinks that ""I am God."" Concoction. Therefore it is said in theśāstra, harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇā[SB5.18.12].One who is not a devotee, he has no good qualification. He is simply on the, hovering on the mental platform."
Hari-śauri,The sixteenth chapter describes it very nicely...,Prabhupāda," Yes.Pravṛttiṁcanivṛttiṁca,navidurāsurāḥ[Bg.16.7].In which way we have direct out activities, in which way we shall have to stop our activities: they do not know.Āsurāḥjanā.Because they don't take direction from God. They make their own way of speculation. So therefore, they are animals, or demons. Because they do not take direction during life, therefore at the endKṛṣṇacomes,mṛtyuḥsarva-haraś cāham [Bg.10.34].All mental speculation, creation, is taken away at death. (to passerby:)HareKṛṣṇa! It is said,kṛṣṇanamakorovaiarsabemichepalaibapathanāiyamaāchepiche:take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, don't try to escape. Because behind you there is Yamaraja! (laughs) He will finish your all concoction.HareKṛṣṇa! (end)"
Tejas,Kṛṣṇais giving.,Prabhupāda, But these rascals they cannot understand. They are making economic development. They have no program for economic development. How they're eating?
Harikeśa,"Well, they're not in very good shape either. I mean they have to stand...",Prabhupāda, But you are also in not very good shape.
Harikeśa,But I can put on a coat. They're standing out in the cold.,Prabhupāda," (laughing) In your country nobody likes white, they have begun totan. So you are not (in) good shape in consideration of ladies. (chuckling) How you can say that it is not in good shape? It has got another lady to appreciate. You may not appreciate. One man, lady, may not appreciate your beauty but that does not mean you are not beautiful."
Caitya-guru,It saysulu.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Caitya-guru; Devotee; Harikeśa,Name of that tree.; Ulu.; Sometimes the trees just die because there's not sufficient . . .,Prabhupāda," No, no. That is not the standard that you do not like somebody, therefore he is not liked by others. That is not very good argument. That is applicable everywhere. The point is that it is a living entity, it so stout and strong, who is giving him food? That is the point."
Harikeśa,"Well, my argument was sometimes he's not being supplied the proper way so therefore economic development is necessary.",Prabhupāda," Alright. That is your... Out of 8,400,000 forms of life, the economic development is taken, a few only. Why others they're developing without any economy? There are so many other living entities"
Harikeśa,"Well for example, the bees or the ants, they're, the bees are making hives.",Prabhupāda, They are also.
Harikeśa,They are developing a big bee-hive.,Prabhupāda," No, no, that is collection of food. The trees also do that. They are calledpāda-pa.Pāda-pameans they drink water by the legs. You drink water by the mouth and they drink water by the legs.Pāda-pa.Just like the, what is called? Bats. They pass stool through the mouth. Is it not? You do not know this? Yes. (laughter) You'll find the bats, they are hanging down the head, and they're passing stool. Sometimes man also does so, when there is strangulation. That is very dangerous disease. What is called? Intestine strangulation. Then passing stool through the mouth. In Bengal sometimes they curse, ""You'll pass stool through the mouth!"" Yes, sometimes they do. Sometimes they eat through the rectum. Do you know that?"
Haṁsadūta,No.,Prabhupāda," Yes. They inject glucose through the rectum. There are many varieties of life. That is the fault of the modern rascals. They want to compare with himself, everything. They do not know that in the God's kingdom there are varieties of life. Otherwise why the 8,400,000? There are varieties. What these rascals know about these varieties?Ātmavatmanyatejagat.They think, ""Everyone should be like me."" (sound of crows in background) Now these birds, within a second, goes hundred feet high. You cannot do. This is variety."
Harikeśa,But the bird is always looking for food.,Prabhupāda," Everyone is looking, that is another thing. But food is there. He has no arrangement for making industry. (to passer-by)HareKṛṣṇa! He has no arrangement for making industry."
Harikeśa,"Yes, that's why he always has to...",Prabhupāda," Their food is there, he is simply searching out, that's all."
Harikeśa,"So if we economically develop, we don't even have to search out...",Prabhupāda," No, no, you are opening factories. They are not opening factories. Nature's food is already there. And ""Be satisfied, take this."" That's all. That much endeavour is required. That is material world."
Harikeśa,"So in other words he has to look for food, but man has to make a factory in order to look for food...",Prabhupāda," No, he hasn't got to make factory. He has got also food but he... If he does, he is claiming to be more civilized. He has complicated his activities by opening factories. That's all. He has got also food. Let everyone remain in nature's... You take fruit from the trees and drink milk, you are also sufficient. You don't require to cook even. There are fruits. Formerly all the sages they were taking fruits from the trees, and milk from the cows. That's all. They did not even produce food. Like agriculture. No. Whatever nature is supplying, that's all. But you are killing the cows, eating the meat, and producing no food and and making things, complicated. This is your civilization. (a car accelerates past)"
Harikeśa,It's a lot of fun to drive fast cars and have sex and see movies and... This is fun you know. It's the only way to enjoy!,Prabhupāda," Yes. Enjoyment is there in the cats and dogs. When you enjoy sex in palace and the dog enjoys sex on the street, the value is the same. The taste does not increase or decrease. But you are thinking to enjoy sex in big palace is advancement. That is your foolishness. Actually sex enjoyment in the palace or on the street is the same. It has no difference of taste."
Harikeśa,So then we can have sex on the street.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You are going to have that, next life! (laughter) Because you are desiring, you will get this life.Kṛṣṇawill fulfill your desire.Yeyathāmāṁprapadyantemāyā... [Bg.4.11].Yantrārūḍhānimāyayā.Kṛṣṇais within you. You are thinking that I will be very much happy if I enjoy sex like the dog.Kṛṣṇanotes, and next life, ""My dear friend here is the body. You enter and enjoy.""Īśvaraḥsarva-bhūtānāṁhṛd-deśe... [Bg.18.61].He is noting down your desire.Hṛd-deśe'rjunatiṣṭhati.Māyayābrāhmayansarva-bhūtāni, yantrārūḍhānimāyayā.This is clearly explained. Alright, you want the enjoyment like dog, here is. Remembrance is also there.Mattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].You wanted to enjoy sex like a dog. Now I have given you this body, now you enjoy. Everything is there, arranged."
Harikeśa,"Yes, but dogs they have to lead a pretty miserable life.",Prabhupāda," But you have also, you have got, not living very happy life, this human society. There are others, even IndiraGandhi, she's always disturbed. Who is happy here? I saw personally. Oh, she is so disturbed. Everyone is unhappy. Who is happy here?"
Harikeśa,"I mean, you say that to anybody in America, they'll go, ""I'm happy.""",Prabhupāda," Everyone is unhappy, America, India, god or beast everyone is unhappy.Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya,bhayameans fearfulness. That is unhappiness. Everyone is afraid what will happen next. This is unhappiness. So either you be IndiraGandhior a street dog, that is nature's law. Nobody is happy. That they cannot understand that there is no happiness, and he's trying to make development for happiness. Actually there is no happiness. This is struggle for existence.Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7],with the mind and the senses he's trying for happiness, but there is no happiness. That is called illusion. That is called illusion. There is no happiness and he's trying to get happiness. Happiness is beyond the senses, material senses.Sukhamatyantikaṁyattadatīndriyamgrāhyam[Bg.6.21],if you want real happiness that is transcendental happiness, not this sense happiness."
Harikeśa,But there is happiness of the senses. When you have sex life...,Prabhupāda," When... Happiness there is, not for the rascals, but for the intelligent. Happiness there is. Unless there is happiness, how we are seeking for happiness? Unless there is immortality, how we are seeking for immortality? There is. But the way in which you are seeking for these things, that is wrong. That is the whole education.Māyāmunisthitaḥ.Just like a foolish animal, he is seeking water from the desert because it appears there is water. But that is his foolishness. A human being he knows that there is no water, it is all sand. That is the difference between animal and human being. Therefore if the dog sees another, what is called? He makes a dog in the water, and he thinks another dog carrying a bread and he wants to take it away, so his bread goes away"
Harikeśa,That's a perfect example.,Prabhupāda," He loses his own bread and there is no other bread. That's all. (Sanskrit) The lion he thought there is another lion within the well, and jumped over it. He lost his life, that's all. This going on. So, he's so strong, lion, it is fabulously strong, but he's animal. In spite of so much strength, he's an animal. Similarly this modern civilization, in spite of so much so-called advancement, they are simply animals. That's all. A big animal is eulogized by another small animal, that's all. Animal is animal, big animal or small. (pointing out on the road) Just see he hasn't got master, and what is his condition?"
Harikeśa,Pretty bad.,Prabhupāda," This isśūdra.If anyone depends on the master's mercy, he's aśūdra.Here in New Delhi, these big, big buildings, big, big officers, as soon as the government will fail, they will be street dogs, that's all. Now they are plundering, by official instrument. Now when the government will be finished, they will be street dog. That's all. This is your civilization. Immediately if all of a sudden there is attack in New Delhi, all the people will starve. There is no food at all, and they'll die."
Harikeśa,"That's a really important point that the government takes more and more, and everybody gets poorer and poorer.",Prabhupāda, Yes. The government is also poor because they do not know how to govern.Buddhiyasyabalaṁtasya.If one has got intelligence he has got strength.
Harikeśa,Change of government means getting poorer.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Harikeśa,A change of government...,Prabhupāda," Change of government... Just like they say, a change of theories by the rascals. Change means rascal."
Harikeśa,But as soon as a government changes...,Prabhupāda," Anything change means it is the domain of rascals, pandemonium. Just like inManu-saṁhitāit is said that,nāsyāṁ svatantratāmarhati,women should not be given independence. Once said, that is fact. If you want to change, you suffer. That's all."
Hari-śauri,Any deviation from absolute law means immediately suffering.,Prabhupāda," Bas,immediately you have to suffer. (reads sign on building) DTS, what is this?"
Haṁsadūta,German Democratic Republic. German diplomat.,Prabhupāda, German Embassy?
Tejas; Harikeśa,This is going to be the PunjabBhavan. For the Punjab state government.; You're painting a pretty bleak picture.,Prabhupāda, Paint picture?
Harikeśa,"The one you're painting of society, and the future.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Harikeśa,There's no hope.,Prabhupāda," No. Unless they take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, there is no hope, that's a fact. There will be more chaotic condition and everyone will suffer and perish.Āchinna-dāra-draviṇāgacchantigiri-kānanam.This is already predcited. I am not painting. It is already there, I am simply repeating. That's all. I am not speculator."
Hari-śauri,Actually most of them are aware that they're in a very bad position. Everybody is expecting another war.,Prabhupāda," Yes, just see. This is capitol of India. This is the position. We can know, understand."
Harikeśa,"The problem is in America, it all looks so nice.",Prabhupāda, That means they are not yet so poverty-stricken.
Harikeśa,"You ask anyone, tell anyone this in America, they'll go, ""Oh well we've had difficult times in the past, but we've always pulled out of it."" Like the Depression. They always quote the Depression of the thirties. The Depression and they say then there was the war and everything became better.",Prabhupāda," Then what is the academy? Nonsense. They are spending so much money in thiskala-kendra,academy, this, that. And no place forKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Just see. Such a cultural book of knowledge. There is no such institution,Gītāinstruction, institute. No. Thiskalabhavan,thiskendrabhavanthis... They have got so many dancebhavan,and whenKṛṣṇadances with thegopīs,""Ah, that is bad!"" The rascals, they do not understand where you have got this tendency for dancing. Because it is there inKṛṣṇa. That they do not understand.Kṛṣṇadancing is bad, and my dancing is very good. They will put so many questions, ""WhyKṛṣṇadance with others' wives."" ""And why your are dancing with others wife, fall-down."" Just see. Kṛṣṇa's dancing is mythology and his dancing is fact. Although His life is mythology (indistinct). (laughter) (indistinct) RabindraBhavan. What they are doing? Such a big house."
Devotee,AravindraBhavan,Prabhupāda, Hm? This is Aurobindo?
Tejas,This is RavindraBhavan.,Prabhupāda," What is written there? Ravindra. Ravindra'sGate. Ravindra'sgateis, how to enjoy illicit sex. This is hisgate. He introducedmāgha-melā,inviting young boys and girls to dance together. And taking this opportunity, he was enjoying young girls. That was his purpose. They would come, the young girls would come, Ravindra (Bengali), grandfather, and he'll, ""Alright you sit down on my lap."" That's all. This is RavindraBhavan, to become debauch. And if you teach young man debauchery, he can attract millions. There is no doubt of it. The pride(?) philosophy. Hm? Debauchery. Allow sex without any discrimination. (observes passing hand drawn cart) Economic development. Where is economic development for these men? There, when there was no economic development, the sametailaand poor people with black cloth was there, and now the same thing is still there, so where is development?"
Tejas,It's increasing actually.,Prabhupāda," Nature's law you cannot check. It must go on.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27].Bhāgavatasays, ""Don't try to improve all these things, it is not possible. Improve yourKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That will be benefit for your life."" (sees another sign) Sangeet (indistinct). Means you can dance. And when our men dance, what do they call? Crazy, crazy. (reads signs) ŚrīRāma. ŚrīRāmafor art and culture. So arrange dancing in this Sangeet dance, here. (laughter) They'll not allow? Hm?"
Haṁsadūta,Their idea of dancing is different to...,Prabhupāda," No, you, you sell tickets for ten rupees, then they'll (indistinct). If you make free then they'll..."
Caitya-guru,International dance.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Why don't you try? Just see. I think they allow dancing by renting the halls, no? What is that?"
Tejas,Which one? That Kamani Hall?,Prabhupāda, Any one. This one.
Tejas,They have performances.,Prabhupāda," But they sell tickets. So similar way, why not ours? [break] Enquire from the authority that we want to hold festival, dance and chant. And singing, don't say chant. See if you can dance, for one week. So what will be the terms. Enquire."
Tejas,"The Supra House, I enquired before, so they want about five or six hundred rupees per day.",Prabhupāda," So that's alright! Five, six hundred, suppose if we continue for one week, they may reduce. Hm? Even five hundred, then we pay one week about 3,500, so why thatLA... What is that?"
Tejas,LIC grounds.,Prabhupāda," Hm. That is 50,000, 60,000."
Tejas,There is one bigVijñānaBhavan. Three thousand people can sit there. Should I organize like that?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Tejas,For when the devotees come.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Tejas,It is better thanRamlīlāgrounds. We'll get the educated and sophisticated people.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Tejas,Not just the Old Delhi people.,Prabhupāda, Yes. And...
Tejas,"And we can make very good... In the newspaper, if we get, then we'll get... We can sell the tickets also.",Prabhupāda," Yes, you attend all theseKalaBhavan. Utilize like that way. You will have always engagement. This our chanting, dancing,prasādadistribution. And they will pay also. We'll sell books. Why don't you take advantage of this institution? It requires organisation, that's all. Why LIC grounds, so much money? Three thousand daily and 40,000 monthly and so on."
Tejas,So much endeavor also.,Prabhupāda, And so much endeavor.
Tejas,"ThisVijñānaBhavanwe can get, it's very nice.",Prabhupāda, So do it! Am I right or not?
Hari-śauri,Programs like that would work very successfully in the west also.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And what is three thousand, four thousand? You get two members and it is..."
Tejas,No. People will contribute. No problem.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Do it immediately.
Tejas,Should I make that for March?,Prabhupāda," Oh yes. Why March? Immediately! Try for immediately. Every week there must be some festival. Hm. In that way you don't require a very gigantic house. We can live anywhere, but our propagation will go on. [break] So manybhavansand so many institutions, utilise them. And there will be concession, if we take for one week, two weeks. They will give concession. Sometimes they may give free also. When they understand this is nice movement. [break]"
Devotee,"...is starting to sell, to make more money. It's not very big (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," No. He has done a mistake so he wants to rectify it. He wants to bring money, (chuckles) but if the money is lost, it is lost, let him come back. What is there? A life saved is more important than save the money. So if I could know the address... (to passerby)HareKṛṣṇa! Then I could write."
Bhāgavata,"Well, we can... Revatīnandana, I think is staying in the, by Los Angeles, right nearSanDiego.SanDiego or... I thinks it'sSanDiego or that other one, Laguṇa Beach.",Prabhupāda, So I wanted to write him a letter.
Bhāgavata,Revatīnandana might be able to give you the address.,Prabhupāda," (greets a man in Hindi)Jaya!Ha.Vṛndāvanahogya.No, if you know Revatīnandana's address, he can forward."
Devotee; Harikeśa,"Yes, he can forward.; Śyāmasundara told me that he wanted to make millions of dollars for you so that he could...",Prabhupāda," Yes. (chuckles) And I am thinking when making millions of dollars, he may not be lost. (to passerby)HareKṛṣṇa,Jaya![break] ...millions of dollars, I shall do. I have got money. I want one soul saved, that is more than millions of dollars. [break]"
Bhāgavata,"(describing Māyāpur) All the devotees, some devotees, they live in the main building, and some devotees they work on the weaving, and some devotees work in agriculture, some devotees work in thegośālā.They make competition, that ""Who will come to themaṅgala-āratifirst, early."" Now they are coming one hour beforemaṅgala-ārati.They're in a competition, and the ones who dance through theārati,throught the entireāratiwithout stopping, the ones that come early, they get this stamp,Kṛṣṇastamp. You get twenty stamps, you get one plate ofmahā-prasādam.You get thirty stamps, forty stamps... You get one thousand stamps, you can go toVṛndāvanafordarśana.You get two thousand stamps you can go for opening ceremony in Bombay. Like this he is making program. Everyone is working very hard to come to themaṅgala-āratifirst, to chant the..., and to dance. Everyone is working very hard. He has increased the enthusiasm.",Prabhupāda, These are all a school building? Hm? They're extended.
Tejas; Devotee; Tejas,Yes.; It's a school.; They have also opened a new school. Besides this they have opened another college.,Prabhupāda, Where?
Tejas,Some place in south Delhi.,Prabhupāda, Oh. (end)
Bhāgavata,"... explaining to them the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in pure devotional service so that they may go back to home, back to Godhead and become liberated from the realms of birth and death in this material world.",Prabhupāda," Is that alright? What he's saying. So, how to help them?"
Devotee,"First we give them the chanting, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,First we give them themah-mantra.,Prabhupāda," Mah-mantra,one may not accept."
Bhāgavata,We have to find the ways and the means by which we can make pure devotional service attractive to each living entity according to his...,Prabhupāda," Unless one feels necessity, why they will accept your proposal to chantHareKṛṣṇa? How you'll make them think ""Yes, it is necessity."" That is wanted. Otherwise anyone will say, some proposition, ""You do this."" Then why they will accept it?"
Bhāgavata,Hm. We have to make...,Prabhupāda," Unless he feels that... That requires philosophy. If you say something dogmatic, why they'll accept? You say that, ""You chantHareKṛṣṇa."" He'll say, ""I have no interest. I have no interest, why shall I chantHareKṛṣṇa?"""
Devotee,Tell them that they are eternal spirit soul.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee,You tell them that you are eternal spirit soul. Tell them about the eternal spiritual world.,Prabhupāda," That you have to convince. That you are eternal, but you are falsely engaged in temporary business. That you have to tell them."
Bhāgavata,"We have to give them knowledge. Knowledge consists of telling them what is the field, who is the knower of the field, and the super-knower of the field. Once they get knowledge, knowledge is the preliminary step to executing devotional service. Once they have knowledge then they will be able to execute devotional service. AndRūpaGoswami says that one who executes devotional service in knowledge, increases his knowledge. Therefore the first thing is that we should give them knowledge and knowledge means to understand this body, the owner of the body, and the supreme owner of the body,Kṛṣṇa./Puṛuṣaprakṛticaiva,/kṣetrakṣetrajñamevaca./ etadveditumicchāmi/jñānajñeyacakeśava.""What is the field; what is thepuruṣa;the enjoyer; what isprakṛti,nature; what is thekṣetrathe field; what is thekṣetrajñor;the knower of the field; what is knowledge and what is the end of knowledge. These things I wish to know.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Bhāgavata,"AndKṛṣṇaanswers him. He says that,idaśarīrakaunteya—""My dearKuntī,śarīraṁ,this body,kṣetrajña..kṣetrajnam...",Prabhupāda, Not my dearKuntī.
Bhāgavata,My dear son ofKuntī.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhāgavata,"Kṣetramityabhidhīyate;that this body is known as the field.Etad yovettitaprāhukṣetrajñaititad-vidaḥ;that this body is known as the field and one who knows this field, he is the knower of the field, he is the knower of the body.",Prabhupāda," Hm. So how to explain, everyone is acting. How he is acting, on the field, that is stated next verse. Field of activities. In English it is called field of activity. That field of activity is this body. According to the body one begins his... Just like one born in the dog's body so the dog care... They, from the very beginning they are searching after a master. You have seen the small?"
Hari-śauri,Pup.,Prabhupāda," Yes. They follow, some gentleman. And because at that time it is good living, somebody takes charge, ""Alright let me take this pup."" And the children also like, so he gets some shelter. So similarly, according to different body the activities begins. Therefore body is the field of activities. A snake, because he has got the field of activity of a snake's body, from the very beginning he is very, very envious. The same, trying to bite others. In this way our activities begin according to the body. And this change of bodies take place in the lower animal life automatically, by nature's law.Prakṛtekriyamānāniguṇaikarmāṇisarvaśaḥ.But when comes to the form of a human being, on account of developed consciousness, he has got responsibility. He has to make his choice. He is suffering in this material world changing different types of bodies, one after another, and the propensity to lord it over the material world is going on. Now he has to change the consciousness, whether he wants to continue this propensity for lording over the material world, or he wants to surrender toKṛṣṇa. This choice has to be made by the human being. If he makes his choice after getting good education from the right source, that ""I am going on in the wrong way, by the desire to lord it over the material nature but I am eternal servant ofKṛṣṇatherefore I must surrender now.Bahūnājanmanāmantejñānavānmām...This is wisdom. And if we do not get this wisdom, simply like animals we continue to lord it over the material nature, by acquiring money.Dharma,artha,kama.Then we are spoiling our life. Separate times we become religious for being promoted to higher standard of life, economic development, big, big scheme, plans, how to make gorgeous city, buildings, roads, cars, slaughter house, scientific, how to cut throat very scientifically. These plans are going on. Some of them are trying to be religious to go to the heaven because he has heard, and that's a fact also, that heavenly planets the standard of living is more opulent, hundreds and thousands times, the sex enjoyment, is hundred and thousand times better. So by so-called religious functions and sacrifices, they are engaged the same, how to satisfy the senses. The dog is also anxious to satisfy his senses. As soon as he finds a female dog, he wants to make friendship with her and have sex. On the street, never mind. And similarly the demigods they are also engaged in the same business. In a different standard only. The business is the same.Āhāra-nidr-bhayametam.So if one wants to continue this business then he'll continue this material body and if he wants to stop this business, come to his original position, then he makes real progress. But nobody is interested in advancement of spiritual life. Generally they take to religion, religiosity, for material happiness.Artho 'rhati.I am distressed, I have no money, or I am suffering from some disease; you'll find all these. So all of them go to thesādhusonly for this purpose. Sir, I am suffering from some disease, so without going to the doctor, and saving so much money, let me pay hundred rupees to thesādhuand he'll give me his blessings. So I will save thousands of rupees, for curing the disease. For this purpose they go tosādhu.Nobody goes tosādhufor going back to home back to godhead. It is only (material) proposition. Otherwise the so-called yogis,sādhus,swamis, they are making good luck business simply by promising that you'll get this material power. This MaheshYogihe says that, what is his philosophy?"
Harikesa,"He says that if you renounce now, you can enjoy later. That if you take some austerity now, like meditation, abstaining from certain things, that later on you can enjoy sex life unlimitedly, have clear intelligence unlimtedly, and ultimately become the...",Prabhupāda," The MaheshYogi, TM. Transcendental meditation. But I don't think they say that if you undergo austerities you..."
Harikesa,"No, that was in the beginning they were saying...",Prabhupāda, Oh now he has changed!
Harikesa,"Now he has changed, because it was too unpopular.",Prabhupāda, It is business.
Bhāgavata,Rajneesh is also like that.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Bhāgavata,"Rajneesh, same philosophy.",Prabhupāda," Hm. But they do not know;natevidu svartha-gatihiviṣṇum;these rascals they do not know what is the actual aim of life. They are, in the groups of ordinary men, they are doing some business opened this transcendental TM shop, that's all. Cheating. Cheating. All of them are are going on, cheating. Nobody knows the real interest is to go back to home, back to Godhead. Nobody knows. Ask any so-calledsādhu,yogi, swami—they do not know. They readBhagavad-gītābut they do not understand. (sic:)Yadjñātvnanivartantetaddhāmaparamamama,so what do they understand, these...tyaktvdehapunarjanmanaitimametiso'rjuna.They do not believe all these things, therefore they say.. Swami Chinmayananda says that whatever is necessary we shall accept; otherślokaswe shall reject. This is his, this rascal's philosophy. As ifKṛṣṇasays something superfluous. They say like that. And the other day some gentleman came, ""It is ficticious writing... You were present?"
Haṁsadūta,Hm.,Prabhupāda," ""Why he is not silent?""Kṛṣṇais not silent.Kṛṣṇais speaking. Why you should be silent when I challenge you like this. He said, he could not answer. This is going on. So many things they are doing, if they are challenged, they cannot answer. You were present? I told him, ""Why silent?Kṛṣṇais not silent. He says continually,Bhagavānuvāca;page after page, and he's saying ""Why he should silent?"" He gave me the information thatBrahmanwas silent and anyone who would go to him, he would remain silent and the message would be transferred."
Bhāgavata,"Rajneesh says the same thing. He says thatKṛṣṇaandArjunadid not speak,Kṛṣṇasimply looked atArjunaandArjunaunderstood. But in order forDhṛtarāṣṭrato understand, because he was blind,Sañjayais speaking and he is explaining everything andVyāsahas written down whatSañjayahas explained. This is, that is what Rajneesh says like that. So why doesSañjayasayBhagavānuvāca?",Prabhupāda," No, no.Sañjayaheard, then he said?"
Bhāgavata,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So, thenKṛṣṇais speaking, otherwise how he heard? Hm? This nonsense is going on. Everywhere, it is very difficult position. So many rascals. And we have to push on our movement through so many obstacles, but still we are going on, that is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Otherwise we are simply meeting with obstacles. What can be done? We have to go, forward. I, I met in... same idea! Impersonalism, bogus thought and no clear idea."
Bhāgavata,"One man came to Calcutta temple, and he insisted thatKṛṣṇawas impersonal, that He has no form. That He was, ultimately there is just theBrahman. I said thatKṛṣṇasays in theGītā, brahmaṇohipratiṣṭhāham;He says, ""thatahammeans theBrahman."" I said that if thatahammeans theBrahman, then why isKṛṣṇabeing redundant in saying that theBrahmanis subordinate to theBrahman?Brahmaṇohipratiṣṭhāham,He just saidBrahmanis subordinate toaham,Me. So ifahammeansBrahmanthen why isKṛṣṇasaying theBrahmanis subordinate to theBrahman? And they are swamis, yogis andavatāras.It is very dangerous position, very dangerous. We have to deal with all rascals and fools. And they have made some position, of course that position is nothing, hm? A big big, I mean to say, Mr.Nandais also big thing, of this idea,nirveśeṣa-śūnyavādī;still we cannot change our position. We must go on with our conviction and that is real. Reality. So, beginkīrtana.(end)",Prabhupāda," Their civilization begins from monkey, and our civilization begins from..."
Dr. Patel,FromVedas.,Prabhupāda, ...Brahma.
Dr. Patel,FromBrahmāactually when he learned theVedas.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"Those four or five, five or fourślokas,original ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,I want to learn from you. I read all the commentary—you have written commentary for four pages—but I think I am littlemūḍhato understand it. (laughing) So I'll learn directly if you can teach me. I am now critically studying your, this thing, commentary on this.",Prabhupāda, Hm. Very good.
Dr. Patel,"Once I read it, but now I am doing a critical study of it. Both of Sanskrit as well as your comments. [break]",Prabhupāda, ...divided by separate words.
Dr. Patel,It is written in purport too much (Sanskrit). The combination of this word is so difficult...,Prabhupāda," ...recommended to studyBhāgavatafrombhāgavata,not by grammar."
Dr. Patel,"No, no. But unless, I mean, I like Sanskrit myself, so I try to learn Sanskrit; I can read other, more Sanskrit books. So it is a sort of a study with me, as well as a knowledge ofBhāgavata.So I am trying to be more critical about it. But that way I have readBhāgavatain Gujarati, even in Hindi (indistinct) Gorhakpur.",Prabhupāda, ...ViṣṇuPurāṇa.
Dr. Patel,ViṣṇuPurāṇais (indistinct) fromMahābhārata.It is very easy. Extremely easy.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa! (to passerby)
Dr. Patel,"Some of the, some people try to poke at us also.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Dr. Patel,They are fools.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Dr. Patel,"Well, because we, we chant God's name, out of fun they also say. But we...",Prabhupāda, That is also good.
Dr. Patel,That we should not take it like that.,Prabhupāda," If one chantsHareKṛṣṇajokingly, that is also good."
Dr. Patel,That's it. Yesterday morning you came?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Dr. Patel,"I thought you were coming tonight. Because you, your letter has come that you reach on the (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," What is that? God says ""Let there be creation,"" and there was creation. Why three months?"
Dr. Patel,"Ah, that is, we are not... (laughing)",Prabhupāda," He says ""Let there be creation""; there was creation."
Dr. Patel,"It was the will of God, so this is also the will of God.",Prabhupāda," Here you see, God says, ""You come here,"" immediately you come. ""You go there,"" immediately you go there. (Dr. Patel laughs loudly) You cannot bring the water by your scientific process, immediately. But when God says ""Immediately""—within a second. (sound of waves in background)HareKṛṣṇa."
Dr. Patel,"I am going to give you a small piece of news. My, that small daughter, she also took first-class, first distinction name.",Prabhupāda," Oh,bolo(?)."
Dr. Patel,"She also stood first. My son also stood first and got the gold medal. She also got the same, by your grace!",Prabhupāda, (laughs) By Kṛṣṇa's grace.
Dr. Patel,"This is unique perfomance in Bombay, that no doctor's two children have got first like this.",Prabhupāda," Hm. All of them, M.D.?"
Dr. Patel,"M.D. Very distinguished, first class. I was very much pleased... [break]",Prabhupāda," ...one is animal. So animal means ferocious.Dharmeṇayenapasavesamānaḥ.They're as good as animal. You cannot expect any good behavior from animals. This is going on. They want to keep the whole population animal, and they're making big, big plans-United Nations, this, that."
Dr. Patel,"This is a problem. It's committed from the poor nations of the world, this United Nations.",Prabhupāda, There is no education for making people a human being.
Dr. Patel,"Karl Marx, Hagel and Engels and those people have got this nonsensical idea that interaction of matter itself produces what we call consciousness. It is not the consciousness which I mean agrees with the matter. The very first basis on which this rascaldom is, I mean the basis is this: revolting against the tenets ofHinduteaching. No?",Prabhupāda, Hindu-Muslim teaching...
Dr. Patel,"No, I meansanātanadharmaof this country.",Prabhupāda," Sanātanadharma,there is no teaching; it is already there."
Dr. Patel,"Yes, that's it.",Prabhupāda, There is no concoction.
Dr. Patel,This concoction has come out from there.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, everywhere. In your country also there are so many parties..."
Dr. Patel,Karl Marx...,Prabhupāda," Karl Marx maybe. Even yourGandhi-ism, that is also concoction.Gandhiinvented nonviolence; it is also concoction. It is impossible. Everyone is doing this—something manufacturing. That is notsanātanadharma.Sanātanadharmais never manufactured. It is already there. You have to accept it, that's all. Otherwise everyone is manufacturing some conncoction. This is going on.Kṛṣṇais teaching, ""Fight."" AndGandhiis teaching fromBhagavad-gītānonviolence. Just see! Is it possible?"
Dr. Patel,The will of God is the real thing.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. His will is supreme. Whatever He says, that's all. As soon as you manufacture, everything is spoiled."
Dr. Patel,"It is fractured by man instead of manufacturing. Fractured, broken.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Andhāyathāndhair upanīyamānas te'pisa-tantryamuru-damnibaddhaḥ[SB7.5.31].Pisatantrya,under the laws of God or nature, everyone is tied, hands and legs, and he's thinking independently, ""I can do that."""
Dr. Patel,"But slowly and slowly, sir, the modern science is trying to prove thatsanātanadharma,the existence of God everywhere. Which in our times, if we respect scientists for their...",Prabhupāda," ""They are trying to prove"" means so long they are rascals..."
Dr. Patel,They are rascals. I quite agree with you. You have caught my rascals. (both laughing),Prabhupāda," As soon as you say ""progressing,"" that means they are rascals. Unless one is rascal, what is the meaning of progress? Hm? Rascal requires progress."
Dr. Patel,"Whether they do progress or regress we don't know, but...",Prabhupāda," No, that progress means still rascals. After ten years they'll make no... This is progress. So they have no standard knowledge, and that is very much palatable, modern progress.Mūḍha."
