Bhagavān,Shopping? Throbbing?,Prabhupāda, Throbbing or throbbing?
Brāhmaṇada,Groping?,Prabhupāda, No. Throbbing?
Bhagavān,Groving? What does that mean?,Prabhupāda, (Bengali)Cat-patha(?). Just like when you take a fish from the water and put it in the land.
Bhagavān,"Oh, throbbing, throbbing.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is right word?
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. All politicians, political party, nobody is in peace, simply throbbing-making this party, making that party, combining this party, and theanti-government troops, and this, that, so many... There is no other business."
Brahmānanda,No solution.,Prabhupāda," No solution. Big, big leaders.Nābhijānātimāmebhyaḥparamavyayam.Mūḍhāḥ.""All these rascals, they do not know the background is 'I am.' Solution should come from Me,""Kṛṣṇasays.Tribhirguṇa-māyāir bhāvairmohita.But they'll not take this solution. They'll make simply, start a plan. [break] ...less you come to this point,māmebhyaḥ,there is no solution. Now, at least for me, thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is no more theoretical. It is practical. I can solve all problems."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"The people don't want to accept any austerity, though.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The people won't accept any austerity.,Prabhupāda," Then you must suffer from the disease. If you have got disease, you must undergo the... What is this austerity? Where is the austerity?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"If they don't accept the medicine, then they can't be cured.",Prabhupāda," Then they must suffer. A man, diseased, and he doesn't want to take medicine, then where is the...? He must suffer. Where is the cure?"
Pañcadraviḍa,They say we're the ones who are diseased.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,"They say we are the ones who are diseased. They say, every one of us, we are diseased, not them.",Prabhupāda," Yes. The deaf man thinks all others deaf. (Laughter) That means they are not even human beings. Animals. They do not come to reason, that ""Whether we are diseased, or you are diseased. Sit down. Talk."" That also, they are not ready. Then? What we can do with animals?"
Pañcadraviḍa,They say we are old-fashioned. They don't want to bother with us anymore.,Prabhupāda," Hm? Then why do you bother with the problems? Why do you bother with the problems of society? You bother, but you cannot make a solution. All over the world, the newspaper is full, simply throbbing."
Viṣṇujana,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, can you make them reasonable? If they're unreasonable, is there some way to make them reasonable?",Prabhupāda," They are reasonable. Man, every human being, is reasonable. It is said, ""Man is rational animal."" So when the rationality is not there, that means they are still animal."
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, what can be done with animals?",Prabhupāda," It is... It is very simple truth. Just I am this body. I am seeking happiness. So why I am seeking happiness? The... If you simply discuss on this point, then you'll find that a man is reasonable. Why I am seeking after happiness? What is the answer? That's a fact. Everyone is seeking happiness. Why we are seeking happiness? What is the answer?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"Because everybody's miserable, and they don't like it.",Prabhupāda," That is a opposite way, explanation."
Kīrtanānanda,'Cause by nature I am happy.,Prabhupāda," Yes. By nature I am happy. And who is happy, this body or the soul?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"No, the soul.",Prabhupāda," Who wants happiness? I want protect this body—why? Because I am within this body. And if I go away from this body, who seeks for the happiness of this body? This common reason, they have no sense. Why I am seeking happiness? I am covering this body because the body may not be affected by cold. Then why I am seeking happiness of the body from cold and heat? Because I am within the... If I go away from the within the body, then there is no more seeking after happiness. Either you throw it on the street or it is in extreme cold or extreme heat, it doesn't matter. Then who is seeking happiness? That they do not know. For whom you are so busy for happiness? That they do not know. Just like cats and dogs."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,But they think they have no time to chant the holy name.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Their philosophy is that to be, in order to be happy, they have to work all day long.",Prabhupāda," Hm. That is your philosophy. You are rascals, but we are not working. Why don't you see our example? We are simply living happily."
Satsvarūpa,But they say we're living off their work.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,"They work and we beg money from them, they say.",Prabhupāda," We don't beg money from them. We take their money in the way that they'll use it for bad purposes, so we take it forKṛṣṇa. They'll drink. They'll smoke. They'll have illicit sex and go to hell. Therefore, out of our humbleness, we have become beggar, just like a father asking the child... He has taken one hundred rupees note and spoiling. ""My dear child, you are so nice. Why you are taking this? Give this. Take a lozenges."" Like that. We are not for their money. That's a wrong theory."
Pañcadraviḍa,"But they say this drinking and smoking, it's all right, but you are parasites because you're taking our money.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,They say that smo...,Prabhupāda," I'm not after... I kick on your face. I don't want your money. (laughter.) You are taking books from us, and you are paying. Therefore I have adopted this means. They may not say... I knew that they would say in the Western countries. Therefore I thought that without books it is not possible. What is this?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Come this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Jayapatāka is pointing to...",Prabhupāda, All of a...
Śrutakīrti; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,We can cross right... No? No.; JayapatākaMahārāja.,Prabhupāda, There is no house?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,You want Prabhupāda to come...?,Prabhupāda, So why he's claiming his money? Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,"He says, ""Because I work for it.""",Prabhupāda," That's all right. But money, what is the standard of money? First of all, just discuss this. What is the standard of money throughout the whole world?"
Devotee (1),"Work, labor, labor.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1); Pañcadraviḍa,Labor.; Purchases...,Prabhupāda," Gold. So have you created gold? How is your money? The gold is already there. You have stolen. You are thief. You are not laborer, but you are rascal, thief. You'll be punished for this policy. Is gold your property?"
Devotee (1),"But they say that if the whole world follows our example, then the society will be finished.",Prabhupāda," Nobody follows. We do not follow... There are so many... Why they are struggle? Why they struggle? Why do you fight? Because you are all thieves—you want to steal God's gold-therefore you fight. Why do you fight? Why you declare war from one nation to another? Because you are all thieves and you want to steal God's gold. Therefore there is fight. Why do you claim, ""This is America, my land""? Is it your land? Have your forefathers created this? Why you falsely claim like that? What is the answer? You have stolen from another party, Red Indians, and you are now claiming, ""We are the proprietor."" You are thieves. You are not even gentlemen. What do you think?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"But they say... They say, ""God is up in heaven. What does He need with gold?""",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,"They say, ""God is up in heaven. What does He need with gold?""",Prabhupāda," ""God is up in heaven""? What is that?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, they say God...",Prabhupāda," Because the master is in heaven, or in some other place, therefore we shall steal?"
Tripurāri,"They say, ""God gave us the land to do what we want with.""",Prabhupāda, No. God did not give you the land. How do you think it is given to you?
Tripurāri,"They say, ""God put us here...""",Prabhupāda," God... God has given to every living entity. You can say like that. Just like father. Father gives to all sons, not that a particular son. Why do you claim? Why do you slaughter the cows? They have got right. So, so many faults there are. But they are not reasonable. That is the..."
GopālaKṛṣṇa,They quote a verse from the Bible where it says that God has given man control over everything on this earth.,Prabhupāda," That control does not mean ""The government is in control, therefore government should kill only."" These... All rascals, simply rascals. Control, that's all right. You are grown-up boys, human beings, so you should control. You should maintain them, and take service from them, not that you shall kill them. They interpret in that ""Because under my control, therefore I shall kill""?"
Devotees,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Just see how foolish they are.
Jayatīrtha,"The children are under the control of the parents, but the parents don't kill the children.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda; Santoṣa,They protect.; Control means protect. [break],Prabhupāda," Suffering for all these sinful activities, always throbbing. See the newspaper. The newspaper is full of news—one side, everyone is restless condition, throbbing, and another news, sense gratification. That's all."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Is it necessary for people to leave the cities and live in ourvarṇāśramasituations in order to become happy?,Prabhupāda," You haven't got to leave anything, provided you understandKṛṣṇaconsciousness. We are not after leaving or accepting. We are not after this. We are after understandingKṛṣṇaconsciousness. What... What shall I leave? Suppose if I leave city—I come here—still it is God's property. So what, what I leave? What I have got that I have to leave? Everything God's property. If you have something, then you can leave. But if you have nothing, what you will leave? It is another bogus. This isMāyāvādītheory.Brahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā.Whyjaganmithyā?IfBrahmanissatya, jaganis alsosatya.[break] ...means they are trying to possess, and thejñānīsare trying to leave—both of them rascals. Where is the question of possessing? Stealing. You... I want to possess, but that thing does not belong to me. Therefore it is stealing. And thejñānīsare trying to give up living. That is also not truth. But you haven't got anything, so what you are going to leave? So both are in ignorance, thekarmīsandjñānīs,the yogis. SimplyKṛṣṇaconscious persons, they are in knowledge. Before your birth the land was there, the world was there. Everything is there. Now you came. Then how do you possess? Before your birth, things were there. How do you possess unless you steal and cheat? Hm? What is the answer?"
Pañcadraviḍa,I have inherited it.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,"They say that man inherits the property of his father, which is God.",Prabhupāda," That means you must obey your father. Otherwise you'll be kicked. (Laughter) You are so rascal that you don't feel obliged to your father who has given you so much things, so many things. You are such a rascal. Therefore you must be punished."
Satsvarūpa,"So if all the land belongs to God, then who decides who will distribute it to the people?",Prabhupāda," You don't distribute. You live only, till the ground and take your food. Where is the question of distribution? Whatever you can till, you take so much land. God has enough land. Why do you possess more? One acre of land is sufficient for producing your food. Why do you take more?"
Satsvarūpa,Nobody should own excessive.,Prabhupāda," No. Therefore God's representative, king, is wanted. He'll divide. ""All right, you take this."" That is king. King means God's representative.Naradeva.Therefore, according to Vedic scripture, the king is so respected,guruis so respected, father is so respected—because they give guidance. ""You live,Kṛṣṇaconscious, like this."" That is their duty. The king is simply planning how to collect taxes, this tax, land tax,saletax, income tax, this tax, this... So his only business is to plunder: ""Let him work, and I shall take it away."" And everyone is doing. That is struggle for existence. I want to cheat you. You want to cheat me. That's all. And therefore they are throbbing. There is no solution."
Pañcadraviḍa,Who will decide who will be king?,Prabhupāda," Therefore the king isevaṁparamparāsystem. The king, the original king is the sun-god. Then his son,Manu, his son,Ikṣvāku. Everything is described. Why don't you see there?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"But who would be the king today? If we establish such a system, who would become the king?",Prabhupāda, Nobody would be king. Everyone is king and fight. That's all. Nobody is king. Everyone is a dog. And they are simply barking.
Devotee (1),"In Africa, recently, one of the leaders has taken all themūrtisand crucifixes from the churches and put his own statue.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Devotee (1),He has banned all religions.,Prabhupāda, Just see.
Devotee (1),"He put his own statue there, that the people should worship him. He's a disciple of Mao.",Prabhupāda," And because there is no king, therefore he is flourishing."
Devotee (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Had there been any real king, he would have been killed immediately. Because there is no king, therefore in South India, they are insulting the statue of LordRāmacandra, because there is no king. Everyone is king. Diplomacy... Democracy. What is this nonsense, democracy? All over the world the royalty is hereditary, never elected. [break] ...and it was hereditary, even Russia. That is the system.Evaṁparamparā-prāptam[Bg.4.2].Andevaṁparamparā-prāptam—who?Rājarṣayoḥ.They are king, but just like saintly persons. That is king, not a loafer class is elevated to the royal post.Rājarṣayoḥ.Although they're holding the post of a king for administration, they're just likeṛṣi.That is king."
Pañcadraviḍa,"In France they went to the Queen a long time ago, and they said, ""The people don't have bread."" So she said, ""Let them eat cake."" And they did not like this. So...",Prabhupāda," These are all stories. Don't indulge in stories. Just try to find out the real fact fromśāstra.Thereforeśāstra...Yaḥśāstra-vidhimutsṛjyavartatekāma-kārataḥ[Bg.16.23].Leaving aside theśāstra,if one talks nonsense... (end)"
Prajāpati,"They describe the nature of God simply in terms of how religious men have understood themselves. They talk about, ""God is simply men understanding men.""",Prabhupāda, That means nobody has approached real God.
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda,No.; No one.,Prabhupāda," That is speculation. If you want to study me, so you can do so either by approaching me or through one of my confidential servant. How one can understand me from outside by speculating? Why do they come to see me? Let them remain far away and speculate. But that is not possible in ordinary common sense also. So how they speculate about God? If you cannot understand even a common man, maybe very big in the society, you cannot understand a common man by hearsay, by speculation..."
Prajāpati,"Practically all the theologians are aligned with one denomination or another, and they're like company men to the big churches, and they're afraid of admitting they do not know about God because they're afraid somebody will leave their camp and come to ours. We say we know about God.",Prabhupāda," Yes. We say frankly that we know God, His father's name, His address, everything. Let anyone come and challenge. He cannot say that ""No, this is not God,"" because he has not approached God. He does not know what is God. How he can challenge us that ""This is not God""? Suppose we are presentingKṛṣṇaas God, so how anyone can challenge? Because he has not approached God. He is simply speculating."
Prajāpati,And not even on his own. He's simply approaching other speculators.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Prajāpati,One speculator simply approaches other speculators.,Prabhupāda," So how they can say, ""This is not God""? Is it possible to say? We say, ""Here isKṛṣṇa, God."" Why not discuss this point for our preaching work. Call all thesannyāsīs."
Śrutakīrti,Call thesannyāsīs?,Prabhupāda, Hm. [break] Theologician. You know?
Śrutakīrti,He's theologian?,Prabhupāda, You know?
Acyutānanda,"No, I didn't know.",Prabhupāda, He's theologician. Now you discuss with him whether by theological arguments one can approach or understand what is God.
Jayapatāka,Śrīla Prabhupāda.,Prabhupāda, Sit down straight. Otherwise feel sleepy.
Jayapatāka,Myself andGopālaKṛṣṇawere just going to Krishnanagara to see that attorney for that...,Prabhupāda," Oh, all right."
Śrutakīrti; Jayapatāka; Acyutānanda,Others will be coming.; TamālaKṛṣṇaand...; Theology or Theosophy?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Acyutānanda,Theosophy?,Prabhupāda," No, theology."
Śrutakīrti,Theology. Theologian.,Prabhupāda, Theosophy and theology is practically the same.
Prajāpati,"No, theosophy is nonsense Buddhist...",Prabhupāda," But according to academic order, logic is the preliminary study of philosophy. Our, our professor, Dr. Watt (?), he defined like that. In 1917...-(Aside:) Come on.-There was the governor in Bengal, Lord Ronaldsey (?), Marquis of Zetland. He was a Scottish man. And our college was Scottish Churches College-(aside:) Get the light. So... don't lean. You'll feel sleep. Just like sit myGuruMahārāja. Show the picture. Be... Become myGuruMahārāja. Yes. That sitting is theyogāsana.I am gone to hell. (laughter) You are young men. You learn from myGuruMahārāja."
Pañcadraviḍa,No leaning.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Pañcadraviḍa,No leaning.,Prabhupāda," No. You'll never see any picture, he was leaning. So that Lord Ronaldsey (?) was very good scholar. So we were... When he was invited, he was taken to all the classes. So I was, at that time, in the second year. So I took permission to sit down in the first benches. The... Our college was very big. So in each class there were 150 students. [break] Where is..."
Brahmānanda,TamālaKṛṣṇais taking a bath.,Prabhupāda," So they were giving role number according to admission. So I did not know that. So my role number was 105. So I thought it very incon... ""I have to sit down after one hundred students?"" So I took one certificate from Dr. Karttika Chandra Bose, who became, later on, my boss. Because he was our father's friend, so ""Give me one certificate in this way, that I am hard of hearing. I must be given first row seat."" So he gave immediately certificate. What is that?"
Śrutakīrti; Jagajīvana,"Some juice.; Some juice and some watermelon, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Oh, all right. Give it."
Acyutānanda,What does theology say?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,What does theology mean.,Prabhupāda, Just explain.
Prajāpati,This is the study of faithful men understanding themselves through the medium of the church.,Prabhupāda, Now you discuss whether this point is very nice.
Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda,So what is the authority?; The authority is the Christian tradition.; TheBible.,Prabhupāda," Yes. When he says church, that means authority,Bible."
Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda,"TheBible.; No, part. TheBibleis part.; Only part, one part.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Viṣṇujana,"He says theBibleis not... TheBibleis not the complete authority?; No, it's the tradition of the church through the great founding fathers, the great theologians up until the present day.; Sādhu,śāstra,guru.",Prabhupāda, No...Vāk...
Prajāpati,"Yes, unfortunately noguru.",Prabhupāda, Church... Church is followingBible.
Prajāpati,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So ultimatelyBiblebecomes authority.
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Pañcadraviḍa,"In certain segments of Christianity, not all.; So what is their conclusion?; Excuse me one minute before we go on. What is this in relation to, this discussion? I just walked in.",Prabhupāda, This... The subject matter is whether by theological arguments one can understand God.
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, according to dictionary, theology,theo,the Latin wordtheo,it means, that means God.Theomeans God. And as far as I know, theology means the science or the study of God.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati,"So by definition...; Not precisely. The word theology comes from the wordlogos. Theologos.Andlogos,in this sense, means the word of God. Yes.",Prabhupāda," Now, the words of God, that means one must know what is God. Otherwise how he can know this is the word of God? What is the answer by the theologian?"
Prajāpati,"The word of God is that a man is known by his works, his fruits. If he is a godly man...",Prabhupāda," No, no. Unless you know what is God, how you can accept this is the word of God? Just like you say, ""Prabhupāda says."" You take it, accept it: ""Oh, Prabhupāda said."" But you know what is Prabhupāda."
Prajāpati,So in...,Prabhupāda, It is not a fiction.
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda,"In theological circles, yes, they are accepting great authorities like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, as well as theśāstra,theBibleitself.; But Martin Luther and St. Augustine are opposed.; Yes, there're many opposed in many different ways.; Then the authority is...; So that's why the goal is not so much a...; Who invented theology?; Saint Paul.; The first Saint Paul?; First Saint Paul.; And he was before Martin Luther.; Yes, he's before Martin Luther.; In the... Also this wordlogos,in theBibleit says, ""In the beginning there was the word."" That'slogos,right? In the beginning there was the word. So what word was that?; In the beginning...?; When it says, ""In the beginning, there was the word.""; According to that same verse, that word was God.; And what was that?",Prabhupāda," But they... They must explain. Just like in Vedic literature the same idea is there. (aside:) Don't lean. I am begging excuse. I am old man. But you should sit down like thatGuruMahārāja. So we know what was the word,oṁkāra.Praṇavaḥsarva-vedeṣu.[break] Sooṁkārais the word. So what is the Christian word?"
Prajāpati,"Again there's no absolute authority. In the vast Christian tradition we have Origen saying one thing and Saint Francis saying another. Widespread... That's why it is not a science that we can go to like we can to Śrīla Prabhupāda for an exact answer,Bhagavad-gītā,exact absolute authority. In the Christian tradition it is simply defined as faithful men understanding themselves in the light of the scripture, in the light of the tradition.",Prabhupāda," No, that is because you are our student. Suppose our preachers meet the theologicians. How to prove that theology is not the means? Theology... Generally, you say it is speculation. So our point is thatnāyamātmāpravacanena labhyonamedhayānabahunāśrutena.Theātmā,Kṛṣṇa, cannot be understood or approached,pravacanena,simply by logical arguments."
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Pañcadraviḍa,"The theologian would agree, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's a question of what's called apologetics. Theology has a specific function for the Christian church, to bring people within the fold. Simply to convince them through any means, logical or whatever, to them to come within the church community, and then once they are within that group, then they can participate in what's called the Christian life. You have taking sacraments, engage in Christian fellowship, taking communion, so many things.; But their authorities disagree.; Yes. That is... They will agree with that.; But our disciplic succession from thousands of years, there's no big disagreement.; I met one... I was traveling about three months ago in India. I met one Christian on the train. So we began to discuss theśāstra.So I mentioned some of the arguments in reference to theBible,that Christ was speaking...",Prabhupāda," (aside:) No, no. Where that covering? Where is it?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"I said that Christ was speaking basically to an uneducated public, the fishermen, etc... So then this man, he stopped me. He said, ""That's all right. But,"" he said, ""You're...""",Prabhupāda, Who? Who? Who said?
Pañcadraviḍa,"I was discussing with one Christian in India. So I attacked... Politely I attacked his scriptural reference, theBible.I was saying that it was not meant that an educated community. So then he stopped me. He said, ""That's all right. You can speak about fishermen. But,"" he said, ""the prime exponent of Christianity was Paul. And Paul was previously Saul. He was not a fisherman. And he was traveling to a town on a particular... Damascus. And there he received direct revelation from God."" And he said, ""Then this one man, single-handedly, he converted most of the known world to Christianity.""",Prabhupāda, That means he got direct revelation from God.
Pañcadraviḍa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is wanted.
Pañcadraviḍa,"So he said just to talk about theBibleas evidence is not enough. He said, ""You're overlooking direct revelation,"" which is what we are also dealing with, that the man who lives according to the word of God, he receives the word of God directly.",Prabhupāda, It is said there?
Pañcadraviḍa,Hm?,Prabhupāda, It is said there?
Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati,"He said to that effect, yes. He said, ""Your argument about a fisherman community is not completely valid.""; There's always a differentiation we must make between a Christian, who we might meet and engage in argument, and the theologian himself. The theologian is a very oily character, very hard to pin down. The Christian, he may have specific beliefs, dogmatic, tenaciously holding to dogma, but the theologian, he-; Well what does that...? What do they say?; The theologians?; Yes.; They are simply word-jugglers. They are not held nearly so tight to...; Well, then, what's some of the things they invent?; Well, one we were bringing up is that theology is a means that faithful men are coming to understand themselves, not that are approaching God. One approaches God within a community and within...",Prabhupāda," That a faithful man understands God, that we say. Then what is the basic principle of theology? Why this separate science has been established as ""theology""? Logy means science."
Prajāpati,"Yes. From the Christian point of view, the science is there simply that man does not accept simply by sentiment or by faith, but he can have his mind convinced as well.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Ravīndra-svarūpa,"But that has to be there. So what is the self according to theology?; Again, Christian... InKṛṣṇaconsciousness, we can ask such a question. ""What does theBhagavad-gītāorKṛṣṇaconsciousness say about the self or aboutKṛṣṇa?"" But in theology it's not so cut and dried. There's so many different authorities, each one saying a different thing.; Well, that's why I said...; You must say, ""So and so says...""; Or they say, ""At the time of judgement, a man must stand before the ever-living God and he will be held, called, held accountable for his actions during this life.""; That's only a very small group. Those who are fundamentalists, who take strict interpretation of theBible,and they're a very small group. And even that group doesn't have very many thoughtful or theological men backing it.; Well, all Christians, they believe that there are, in one way or another, they're going to be held accountable to the word of God. Isn't that?; No.; Well, how they can have any...? How they can have any tenets or principles if they don't believe they're accountable to God?; Because they believe they can use Jesus like a doormat to clean their sinful activities of themselves.",Prabhupāda," Now, one thing is that why theology should be in reference withBible?If it is a science, then why should it refer only to theBible?"
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda,"Yes. The biggest school of theology, Harvard School of Theology... The study of theBibleis there, but only on the side. Instead, they study Freud, Karl Marx, everybody else...; Well, they should studyGītā.; Yes, that's our point. How to get them to realize that? That's a question.; So we'll ask them, ""We have a most scientific and detailed description of the self and God and the means to join to Him. That cannot be avoided in your study. And we claim the highest standard of renunciation, and worship and godly society.""; And their answer...; ""You can't avoid us.""; Their answer to such a challenge will be: ""You please go across the street to the study of Hinduism.""; ""No, you said theology. God is not a Christian God.""; But they're not interested. They only want to hear the Christian point of view. And for them, ""Christian"" doesn't meanBible;it means their own...; That's Prabhupāda's first thing—what is God? Is it the Christian God? What is God? What is your definition of God? Is He a Christian God or pure?",Prabhupāda," No, the... The... First of all, this should be established, whether God can be Christian God orHinduGod or Muslim God? Is God to be designated like that? God is one, so how there is one God? If Christian has got separate God, aHinduhas got separate god, Muslim has got separate God, then how God is one?"
Prajāpati,"Their answer would be: ""We cannot talk about God. We can simply talk about the Christian tradition of God, or the...""",Prabhupāda," Now, again you come to the Christian God."
Acyutānanda,Then your knowledge is limited.,Prabhupāda, Then... Either Christian tradition... Then it becomes bound up by the Christian ideas.
Prajāpati,And that is exactly the situation today.,Prabhupāda," But that is not God. Just like gold. Gold is everywhere gold. Because it is in Christian country, you cannot say, ""It is Christian gold."" And because it is in Muslim country, you cannot say, ""It is Muslim gold."" Gold is the world standard of money. The same gold, dispatched from America, can be accepted in India. Dispatched from India, it can be accepted in Palestine because it is gold. Everyone who knows what is gold, he'll accept it. So God should be like that. And therefore the nameKṛṣṇa, ""all-attractive""... When there is gold, either you be Christian, Muslim,Hindu—""Oh, here is a lump of gold. Can I possess it?"" That is attraction. So as gold is all-attractive, similarly, God must be all-attractive. And that word is used asKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇameans all-attractive. One who knows gold, he'll be attracted. Doesn't matter whether he'sHinduor Muslim, Christian, poor, rich man, black, white. It doesn't matter. Here is gold, and everyone... Just like in your country there was gold rush. Eh? In California? From all different parts of the world they came. So gold is gold for everyone. So now one should try to understand or check what is gold. That is required."
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Pañcadraviḍa,"These men, Śrīla Prabhupāda, are very, very puffed up. They think that even such discussions of who God is and what God is, that... They feel they're way past that, and that's for lower class men to discuss.; Why do we give anything to them? (?); But when you came to France, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you spoke at the Theology Club. About four years ago you came for a conference. They arranged a big meeting at the Theology Society in France, a world-wide society. And one thing I was... One thing I was considering. They must be interested because the Christians say that there is soul, and they say that there is God, so then wouldn't our question be: ""What is the relationship of the soul to God?"" They admit there is a soul. Every human being, they say, has a soul.",Prabhupāda," No. That, that is also beginning of understanding. But first, preliminary understanding should be that God is one. There cannot be Christian God. There cannot beHinduGod. There cannot be Muslim God. That is not complete idea of God. That is imperfect. Just like in Vedic literature,brahmeti paramātmetibhagavāniti: [SB1.2.11]three phases of understanding of the Absolute. First, beginning, isBrahman, then, further advanced,Paramātmā, then, final advancement,Bhagavān. Similarly, the final realization of God is the Supreme Person. And then we should seek (see?) who is that person. That is real theology."
Pañcadraviḍa,"What if they say, ""We agree there's one God, but we do not agree that His name is Kṛṣṇa"" or ""We do not agree...""",Prabhupāda, Then you suggest what is His name. My next challenge will be... You suggest.
Pañcadraviḍa; Ravīndra-svarūpa,"Well, they...; In theBiblethey give twelve names for God.",Prabhupāda," No, let me finish this. If you do not acceptKṛṣṇais the name of God,... I have explained what is the idea ofKṛṣṇa. TheKṛṣṇameans all-attractive. The example is given: Just like gold. Gold is attractive to everyone—to the educated, the uneducated, to the black, to the white, man, woman, everyone. One who knows God, er, one who knows gold-gold is attractive. Similarly, God is all-attractive. There cannot be that ""It is black gold,"" ""It is white gold,"" ""It is Christian gold,"" ""It isHindugold."" No. Gold is gold. So we presentKṛṣṇathat ""Here is God, all-attractive."" Now you say, ""No, He's not God."" Then you present your God."
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, I know just the...",Prabhupāda," You cannot say, reject. They cannot rejectKṛṣṇaunless you present an alternative."
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, here's the argument. Part of the thing I remember in the Judeo tradition, Judeo-Christian tradition, in the... Whenever we used to go to service and all that, they used to have in the prayer books... They would never write out the name of God because they say...",Prabhupāda," Oh, that means you do not know."
Pañcadraviḍa,"No, they say God's name should never be spoken out loud.",Prabhupāda, Why?
Pañcadraviḍa,I don't know.,Prabhupāda," This is nonsense. If you know somebody, why should you say, ""His name should not be explained""?"
Brahmānanda; Ravīndra-svarūpa; Acyutānanda,"They say that God's name is so pure and we are so impure that to utter His name is to make it impure.; Is blasphemy.; No, I heard the explanation that a nonbeliever should not know it.",Prabhupāda, That is all right.
Acyutānanda,So they don't say it out loud.,Prabhupāda," No, when we come to argument that... We are supposed to be all believers in God. We are not nonbelievers. We simply want to ascertain who is that God. We are not nonbelievers. Then some persons who believe in God come together so to ascertain who is God. So just like when we come to a meeting to elect a president, so they are not nonbelievers. They are not nonbelievers. As there are so many personalities, candidate for president, now who is the right person to become the president? That is wanted. To the nonbelievers, he has no access. About discussion in God he has no access. When we discuss about God, it is supposed they are all believers. So if you say... Just like we are holding meeting to ascertain... There are so many names of God. Now we ascertain who is real God. God means there should be no more above Him.Mattaḥparataraṁnānyat [Bg.7.7].That is God."
Viṣṇujana; Acyutānanda; Viṣṇujana; Acyutānanda; Viṣṇujana,"Christians have such a name. They call Him Yahweh.; Yahweh.; Yahweh means ""I am that I am. No one is beyond Me.""; Yahweh.; They will say Yahweh is God.",Prabhupāda," No, Yahweh, what is...? That is the name?"
Viṣṇujana; Prajāpati; Viṣṇujana; Prajāpati,"Name. ""I am that..."" It means in English, ""I am that I am.""; Some people translate that as Jehovah.; Jehovah.; But it's the same word. In fact, everyone agrees they do not know what the real name is. Some say Yahweh; some say Jehovah. The Jewish tradition replaces completely and says Adonai, instead.",Prabhupāda, That's all right. He may not say. But we have to take from the meaning. What is the meaning?
Viṣṇujana,"""No one is beyond Me.""",Prabhupāda," That's all right. ""No one is beyond Me."" Then he comes to our conclusion, all-attractive. This is... They come to our conclusion, all-attractive. Because if somebody is beyond Him, then he should be attractive. But if He's final attractive, then all-attractive,Kṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇameans all-attractive. What do you think?"
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati,"It would be very nice to engage them in this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda. But they're not interested. They're interested in...; Self. ""Then my aim is that..."" They're interested in people, then. How they understand self.; Right.; So we have the highest standard of renunciation, highest standard of piety, highest standard of all religious qualities. So they cannot deny it. They cannot be noninterested.; But in that sense, they would see us as a threat.; Yeah. So then you're only interested in keeping your Harvard chair.; That's right.; Then they're not sincere.; Harvard chair, bishop's salary... Bishops get 25,000 dollars a year.; Then if you can't discuss openly with people, then what's the point?; The point is they have big, big buildings, big, big salaries, big, big positions...",Prabhupāda," That is... That is all right. If you want to keep one man in a very high position, you should give all comforts. That is good. Just like if you want to keep a king, he must have a palace. He must have his officers, secretaries..."
Acyutānanda; Pañcadraviḍa; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati,"So he means to say that if we present that we are better theologists, then their position will be in jeopardy.; Then the question is ""Then why...?"" Now we are... Hypothetically, in this situation, we are approaching these theologists. Then why we are approaching if they are not open to discussion? I mean, what is the purpose in going to them?; No.Prajāpatihere studied theology and brought it up to Prabhupāda.; The purpose is because they are purporting to be...; Authority.; ...what Śrīla Prabhupāda really is. Śrīla Prabhupāda is the real theologian, but they are using that name. And they... In that sense, they are the biggest cheaters. They're going by the name theologians, and they're not actually theologians. They're simply scholars, dry academicians.",Prabhupāda, What is that scholarship? Simply...
Prajāpati,"The scholarship... They have degrees by their names, and they've gone through listening to other mental speculators, and now their students listen to them.",Prabhupāda, You said there are twelve names?
Ravīndra-svarūpa,Yes. I have a list of them.,Prabhupāda, In theBible?
Ravīndra-svarūpa; Acyutānanda; Ravīndra-svarūpa; Acyutānanda,"Yes. One of them means ""the Lord who sees me."" One of them means ""the supreme friend,"" ""the supreme father."" One of them means ""the Lord of the mountain."" One of them means ""the King, the greatest King."" ""Brother"" is another meaning. So... And these are all in theOld Testament,all these different names. So one of their arguments is that we're presenting a different name. Therefore they think it is a different God. We can refer that there are twelve names. Does that mean that there are twelve Gods?; We have names which apply to those also.; Yes.; ""Supreme friend.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.Dīna-bandhu.
Acyutānanda,Jagad-bandhu.,Prabhupāda, Hekṛṣṇakaruṇā-sindhodīna-bandhojagat-pate.We have got these names.

Ravīndra-svarūpa; Acyutānanda; Ravīndra-svarūpa,Lord of the mountain.; Girirāja.; The Lord of the Mountain.,Prabhupāda, Hekṛṣṇakaruṇā-sindhodīna-bandhojagat-pate.Then?
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"""The brother.""",Prabhupāda," Gopīka...? What is that, next line?"
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"""The brother.""",Prabhupāda, Hekṛṣṇakaruṇā-sindhodīna-bandho...

Prajāpati,"LordCaitanyawould hear from ŚrīvāsaPaṇḍita""The Thousand Names ofViṣṇu.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. And thousand names, they are recorded, but He has got millions of names."
Pañcadraviḍa,"In one tape, you said actually God has no name. You said God has no name, but because He...",Prabhupāda," No, that is other party's argument, ""God has no name."""
Pañcadraviḍa,"No, no. In the tape, you said... In this tape,bhajana,explanation ofbhajana,you said, ""God... Actually God has no name, but because He does so many things, then He has names for...""",Prabhupāda," Yes, according to His activities, there are names."
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"But all these twelve names, they still make that personality whom they are describing all-attractive. So that means...",Prabhupāda," Yes. And not only that. When you have names, that means God is person. That must be admitted. God cannot be imperson. You may have twelve names or twelve thousand names, but when He has got name, He's a person. Now, our point is: ""Who is that person?"""
Trivikrama,"Their point is... Well, one of their points is that if Christ was actually the son of God, why didn't he talk aboutKṛṣṇa?",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Trivikrama,"If Christ was the son of God, the good son, how is that he didn't, he never mentionedKṛṣṇaby name? Sometimes they criticize us like that: ""Why is there no mention ofKṛṣṇain the ChristianBible?""",Prabhupāda," He might not have mentioned, but why there are twelve names in theBible?"
Pañcadraviḍa,That'sOld Testament.That's not Christ...,Prabhupāda, The name is there.
Acyutānanda,"And Christ, Prabhupāda has...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,The point is that just like when you're...,Prabhupāda," No, first of all, one should be answered."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I'm going to answer his point.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Pañcadraviḍa; Prajāpati,"The answer to his point is that just as there's a president of the United States, so when someone is talking about the president, according to how intimate that person is, you discuss different subject matters. For example, if the person is just a common person, a regular person, you may discuss about the president's powers in the government. But when you meet someone who actually is intimately connected with the president, then you describe the president's family, how the president's family is doing, what is the president doing in his time of relaxation, etc. So similarly, Jesus was speaking to persons who were not very intimate with God. They were not so much spiritually advanced. Therefore, for those persons, simply the power and glory of God is mentioned in theBible.ButKṛṣṇa, the description ofKṛṣṇain theBhāgavatam,is meant for the pure devotees. And for them the very detailed, intimate description ofKṛṣṇais given there.; Nirmatsarāṇām.; A very major thing happenned to the Christian tradition in about 400 A.D. Up until that time, as best our records are, Christianity was very much likeKṛṣṇaconsciousness, very much like our movement. But at that time it became the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine, and it took on many of the paraphernalia of the old Roman demigod worship, and at that time it became a whole...",Prabhupāda," Just to make it favorable for your government, for the government."
Acyutānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then deterioration began.

Again, mentioning this Saul. Saul was converted on the way to Damascus, and he became a believer in God. Then, by himself, he traveled all over the known world and convinced everyone in the Roman Empire to accept, to accept Christianity. So it may have taken on those formal signs, but actually there was no process... According to them, there was no process done to dilute the religion or to weaken it or to change it, but it was only accepted by the masses. That's all.; Actually a very interesting thing, in terms of this point, is that this Paul, Saul, was in confiict with the direct disciplic succession from Jesus in many points. Those who were his, Jesus's, direct disciples, Paul disagreed with them and cut out many of their teachings or the teachings that were coming down in direct disciplic succession to make it more palatable to the outlying areas.; The government.; Yes. So at that moment there, the disciplic succession was broken.; What is the time difference between Paul and Jesus' (?) disciples?; He was here at the same time. Peter, James... He was a contemporary, but he had never had any personal contact with Jesus while Jesus was in Gospel. (?); In fact, he lived... He... In the beginning, he was against Christianity.

So have you got any name like that? That means if you chant that name, you get immediately contact with God."
Ravīndra-svarūpa; Trivikrama,"That idea is put forth in thePsalmsrepeatedly. It says, ""Sing the names of the Lord with high-sounding cymbals, with drums."" It says in one place that ""The name of the Lord is exalted even beyond heaven.""; ""Hallowed by Thy name."" There's a prayer.",Prabhupāda, That... What is that name?
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"They don't... The Christians... It says, ""Sing the name of God,"" but they don't do that.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. But if you have to chant name... Just like we prescribe, ""ChantHareKṛṣṇa,"" so what is the name they recommend to chant?"
Prajāpati,Adonai.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Prajāpati; Acyutānanda; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa; Ravīndra-svarūpa; Viṣṇujana,"Adonai.; ""Adonai"" is a...

In the beginning of theBibleit says that ""In the beginning was the word, and the word was God."" And modern-day translations, they have substituted the word ""Christ"" for ""the word."" So it says, ""In the beginning was Christ, and Christ was God."" So they're trying to make, they're trying in that way to make Jesus God. And that is the name, because they don't know what is that word.; Yes.; We can understand this...",Prabhupāda, That is again another adulteration.
Prajāpati,"It is adulteration, but the tendency is there becauseKṛṣṇais a person. Because God is a person, they, everyone, wants to worship God as a person. It's the only way God can be worshiped. So because they do not knowKṛṣṇa, they make Jesus God so they can worship him as a person.",Prabhupāda, That is also good. But do they do?

That's...""",Prabhupāda," No, if you keep God or Christ within your heart, then your heart will be purified. That means you are cheating."
Trivikrama; Pañcadraviḍa,"Yeah.; Yeah, that's what it boils down to.",Prabhupāda," You are all cheaters, not Christians, but cheaters. You do not keep in the heart Christ's name or God's name, but you keep your own ideas. Therefore you think it is impossible. Otherwise, your heart would have been cleansed.Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12]."
Acyutānanda,You know the Cardinal that you spoke with in Paris?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Acyutānanda,You know how he died?,Prabhupāda, Yes.

Trivikrama,I heard the tape. So now he is an animal. He knows.,Prabhupāda," (Chuckles) So I am just interested, but people will, many people will come and many theories. So you discuss among yourself how to get the strength to defend yourself and to convince them."
Acyutānanda; Prajāpati,"But unless their theology is practical, if it is not practical, then it is useless to study theology, if it has no practical application.; They make that point. ""Therefore,"" they say, ""such talk about God is impractical. So therefore we don't bother talking about God.""",Prabhupāda," ""Then why you put theology?"" That is our point. ""Then why you have put this theology?"" ""There's no use talking of God""—that is another thing. But when you make ""logy,"" you must come to logic. ""Logy"" means discussion. Is it not? ""Logy"" means science?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," What is the meaning of ""logy""?"
Ravīndra-svarūpa,Knowledge,Prabhupāda, Hmmm? Find out this dictionary meaning.

The theologians that we're concerned with are those that are actually influencing millions of people by their rascaldom.; Do they come up with any big decisions every year and change people's...?; I never met anyone who was influenced by any of these theologians. I never even heard of 'em. I never even heard of them till you just started discussing today. (laughter) I don't know anybody in the Western world who's influenced by any theologians.; No, maybe they set the policies for churches. Maybe they influence them.; Yes, right.; They do.; The main people who listen to the theologians are the pulpit preachers, the shepherds of individual flocks of Christians around the world. They are the ones who are most influenced by the theologians.; They stay in...; Government leaders all over the world are influenced by these... And they run their... They base their policies on the ethics of the Christian Church.; What I say is that...; And if you try to present something different, then they're opposed to that based on their conditioning, based on the influence...; But is the Christian Church, is that being determined by the theologians at Harvard? They, they have some say in this?; Yes. They set the... They write the books, though. They interpret theBible.They are the so-called gurus because they interpret the scripture whatever way they want to.; So you know some of these people?; Yes, we've had some contact. We arranged a very nice meeting with KīrtanānandaMahārājawith one of the foremost theologians at Harvard. His name is Harvey Cox. Perhaps you're familiar with his bookThe Secular City.And we came and brought devotees into the class and chanted. The people thought it was...; So what was his suggestions?; Now, what was his reaction, first of all? What was his reaction toKṛṣṇaconsciousness? What did he say?; They don't take us seriously. They still look upon us as just singing and dancing in the street, and that's it.; Well, that's...; They have to realize that...; That's also there in theHinducommunity. Most of the Hindus they don't take us seriously either.; Even when they see all these books?; No, when they see that we've given up our drugs and our everything, we've taken a religious life, they invited us. I think they just see that we have something to beat them, and they usher us out, knowing that their position is in jeopardy.; The reason we're here right this afternoon is the fact that though these men are preaching this rascaldom, our preaching can undermine it, at least to the point where they can be influenced and that the people that they are, are being influenced by them will take some notice, ""Yes, this is a viable alternative"" to the rascaldom that they're being presented, this...; Good.; I had the feeling that it is just like when I was approaching people in Calcutta. They said, ""We'll help you, but we cannot help you in a big way because we're already giving so much help to the Ramakrishna Society."" So then after hearing this a few times, I concluded that people respected the Ramakrishna Society because they have a lot of money and a lot of popular support and everybody was giving to them, so they just, just like everybody else, they wanted to be part of the whole show. So the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, we have books, we have teaching, and we can present the principles very purely. But in terms of a world movement, we don't have a lot of money or a lot of power or a lot of tanks or a lot of guns or a lot of churches or a lot of popular support.; What is the idea...?; So maybe the theologians won't accept us on that basis, that we're not powerful.; Who is the ideal Christian according to the theologists? What do they say is the best, let's say, flock of Christians? What do they do?; Who's the biggest?; Bishop Sheen?; There is no, I would say, among theologians, no consensus.; So when are they satisfied that you are a real Christian or not?; When do you become a theologian? Who is the biggest theologians? How are they accepted? On the basis of degree?; Scholarship.; Yes, scholarship, books published.; Well, then it could probably be possible to be a theologian without even really believing in Christianity.; Oh, definitely. Most of them don't.; Then Prabhupāda's the biggest theologian because we have twenty-two books right here on the shelf. And we have the credentials. And they cannot dismiss the books either because we have the credentials that they are being used in major universities in, all over the world. So if universities are accepting, and they get their power from the degrees obtained from the universities, they cannot dismiss any longer. Isn't it?; We have broken the disciplic succession now. We become by degree, by qualification.; In all their scholarly journals—and they publish quite a few—very few, little is written about God. The subject matter of God is...; They talk of man's relation, the benefit of man...; The Church, different aspect of scholarship, different aspects in biblical research.; No, say some things specific.; Yeah, I can't understand all that.; I know what you mean. I read some of their...; I have tried to attack them by just taking a specific article, and I am lost immediately myself. It's all mish-mosh. There's nothing there to fight. It's like a... But the use is that we must...; There must be something to attract them. So they're giving arguments for Christians who are, you know... intellectual.; The thing is... The thing that makes it hard to understand what the use is—because we say, then, in all these... We try to define and they can't be defined. And then you say that they don't take us seriously. They don't accept what we're saying. They don't accept these teachings. They would dismiss us in a minute. What is the use?; They must say something concrete.; Well, the most concrete they get is their dissatisfaction with the present status quo. So in that we're in agreement with them. ""Yes, we're dissatisfied with the status quo also, but we are offering alternatives that are...""; They're dissatisfied with the people who are sinful.; Where is their method for changing the status quo?; They're not dissatisfied...",Prabhupāda," Method is there, the Ten Commandments, but they won't follow."

They're looking to Freud, they're looking to Marx, they're looking to everyone as an authority.; I'll give you an example, In Zambia, the president, his name is Dr. Kenneth Kaunda. [break] He's exactly one of these persons. I met with him a couple weeks ago. He's John, John... What's his name? John Patrick? Śrīla Prabhupāda, you met him in London. And he's one of these philosophers. And his argument against our work and our preaching was that we shouldn't fly on jet planes because it pollutes the air. That was his argument; How did he get to Africa from London?; He said he walked. (Laughter); And you killed so many insects under your feet.; No, he goes on jets. But that's his argument to defeat our philosophy. This is how they argue. What he's saying is true. They actually argue like this, that we are, we are, our philosophy is not correct because we fly on jet planes. They have a completely materialistic...

But they can't say anything.; So... These men are influencing. One of the things we did. We invited him to the temple, and we gave him a big plate of niceprasādam,and he liked it very much. He said, ""If my wife could learn to cook like this, I'd give up meat."" So we thought that was very significant.; Send his wife over to the temple. We'll train her up.; So why don't you write a book? Why don't you become a theologian from their point of view and write a book about Christianity? If they, if they can do it, if they can do it, write books and get people to read them, then why can't you do the same thing, write books on Christianity?; Did you pass the course in...?; If you want to get into their world.; Rūpānuga... Rūpānuga is already getting one book together, so you can write a chapter in it. There's a book, and he's going to comment... It's a scientific book on different aspects and he's commenting on, I think, social, various social applications. So you can comment on the theosophical points. I mean it can be included in this book. Actually if you have the qualifications, I'm sure he would want a chapter from you.

Now, if, by meeting God, by seeing God, you become purified, then by chanting His name also, you'll become purified, because we say God and His name, identical. But if, by meeting God, you become immediately purified of material contamination, similarly, by chanting God's name you immediately become purified. So what is that name of God that acts immediately, exactly like God? So farKṛṣṇaname is concerned, it is practically that so many thousands of men, they are chanting ""Kṛṣṇa,"" and they are becoming purified. So find out any other name which can act equally. Then that is accepted as God's name, not by imagination."
Pañcadraviḍa,"How do you find out, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Eh?

Devotee (2),The books are what actually attracts them. It attracts their minds.,Prabhupāda, Yes. We have got two process. One process is chanting. Another process: read books. That is also chanting.
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"One argument that the Christians have... When we tell them that we accept Lord Jesus, so they say that ""You haven't accepted Jesus into your heart."" We say, ""We're following the teachings of Jesus."" And they say, ""But you haven't accepted Jesus into your heart,"" that ""You're not a follower of Jesus. And that's the lacking qualification.""",Prabhupāda," It is very difficult to convince them. [break] We may not keep the Christ in heart, but even you do not keep Christ by your dealings. You are simply disobeying the orders. Then how you can be a Christian?"
Ravīndra-svarūpa,"Jesus says that inMatthew.He says that ""Many will come to me and say, 'Lord, Lord,' that 'We cured the sick in your name, and we cast out demons in your name,' "" and Jesus said that ""When they come I will say, 'Get away from me. I know you not, for you failed to do the will of my Father.' "" Even though they're claiming to be Christians.",Prabhupāda, Yes.

Ravīndra-svarūpa; Prajāpati; Ravīndra-svarūpa; Prajāpati; Pañcadraviḍa,"Many of them are afraid to accept our movement or our philosophy because they feel that their personal religion is threatened, that they'll have to stop being a Christian. So when I earlier mentioned that to start some Christian group, the idea was to have some people who are professing to be Christians, but they are taking the word of Jesus to the deepest point where he says that ""There are many things I have not revealed to you, and you will understand them by the grace of the Holy Spirit."" So they could have a Christian group where people worshiped Lord Jesus as their spiritual master and simultaneously worshipedKṛṣṇa. And they could introduce that to develop more knowledge of God one can read theBhagavad-gītā,one can follow the instruction in theBibleby chanting the names of God, and they would have better access to Christians than those of us who are wearing robes or shaving our heads.; Better the same people to understand that Śrīla Prabhupāda meets all the qualifications that Jesus Christ met, plus more in he is here, and he is the Christ. Christ is the anointed one of God.; Yes. So we have to bring them to that understanding, but we have to understand also that they're afraid, that their own faith will be shaken. So if you can give them more knowledge, then they can come to understand that. So if they... You have said that we accept Jesus as ourguru. So if someone was practically worshiping, so then they could see. They could not deny. When a devotee says to them, ""Yes, I'm accepting Jesus in my heart,"" They could not deny. If they are, for instance in a person, householder's home-he's worshipingKṛṣṇa, and he's having a picture of you and a picture of Jesus—then there's no way they can deny that they are not Christians. And they could have access to a lot of the young Christian groups. [break]; This life...

But can the scientists... If a scientist claims he'll create the conditions in which a soul will enter, do we accept that premise, and I thought, ""No, because that's giving them much too much ground,"" that if we say that, then by their definition, they can say, ""I am creating life. I don't want to argue over the existence or not of the soul, but I'll arrange all the chemicals for you.""",Prabhupāda," Where is that chemist?

The enzymes are being naturally created, and the soul is there. So what is his credit? The arrangement is already there automatically, the secretion between the man and the woman, and they mix together, emulsified, and the situation is created, and the soul comes there. The soul is injected through the semina of the man. It is already arranged. So what is your credit?"
Pañcadraviḍa; Prabhupāda: ; Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, they say the credit is that ""We are doing these things in the laboratory without the presence of the soul.

Pañcadraviḍa,Kill him again.,Prabhupāda," Yes. This is their philosophy. And as they pass laws in the Parliament, similarly, these churches approve: ""Yes, homosex is all right."" Then it is all right. This cheating system is going on. Similar cheating system is the Hindus also. You'll find in Calcutta, in College Street, so many butcher house. And they have kept one goddessKālīthat ""We are eating Mother Kali'sprasāda."" That's it. This is going on."
Brahmānanda,Kalieats meat.,Prabhupāda," Kalidoes not eat meat, but it is theśāstra'sinjunction that those who are unable to give up meat-eating, they may sacrifice one goat, not cow, one small animal before the goddessKali, onamāvāsya(new moon) day, night, not day, and they can eat it."
Pañcadraviḍa,"If it's offered, though, who accepts it? Whoseprasādamis it? Who takes it?",Prabhupāda," Theprasādamis not... That meat is not taken byKali, but it is taken by the witches and others, associates ofKali."
Brahmānanda,"InŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,you write that goddessKalitakes theprasādamof her husband, Lord Śiva.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,So therefore she is vegetarian.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Madhudviṣa,"You were talking about enviousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And we see that this even sometimes pervades in our own society.",Prabhupāda," Because you have, you are not yet perfect. That means. You are not yet perfect. You are trying to be perfect. Now be perfect."
Madhudviṣa,"Is there a way, is there a specific way to counteract this bad quality of enviousness?",Prabhupāda," And yes, just chantHareKṛṣṇa. Cleanse your mind. All dirty things will go. Because you neglect to chant regularly, therefore the dirty things remain."
Pañcadraviḍa,"One devotee was talking with aMāyāvādīsannyāsī,famoussannyāsī.So he said that ""Your desire to attainmukti,that is a material desire.""",Prabhupāda," No, we don't wantmukti."
Pañcadraviḍa,Yes. So...,Prabhupāda," Muktiflatters me: ""Please accept me."" We don't wantmukti."
Pañcadraviḍa,"So the devotee went on, ""To want to become one with the Lord, that is material desire."" So theMāyāvādī, he answered, he said, ""No, to want to remain separate from the Lord and enjoyrasa,or exchange, with Him, that is also material desire. Because you want to stay two, God and you, so you can be separate just so you can enjoy an exchange. That is also a desire.""",Prabhupāda," Therefore, because you have no brain, therefore you cannot understand therasaswithKṛṣṇa. That is spiritual; that is not material.Ānanda-rasa.Ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ [Bs.5.37].That is the Vedic statement. There iscinmaya.In the spiritual world there isananda.You... You have no knowledge. You, due to your poor fund of knowledge, you think that in the spiritual world there is norasa;it is simply void, negation of thisrasa.Just like a diseased man. He is practiced to drink bitter medicine and pass stool on the bed and so many inconveniences, so if some of his friends says, ""When you'll be cured, you'll be able to pass stool in the lavatory. You haven't got to, haven't got to pass stool..."" Then he shudders: ""Again I have to pass stool after becoming cured? Again I have to eat? No, no, this is not good. Make it zero."" He has no idea what is the meaning of passing stool in healthy stage. It refreshes the body. We get good energy. That he cannot conceive. He thinks that ""If there is passing of stool again, then it must be the same suffering as I am undergoing now in this condition."" So the Māyāvādī's idea of spiritual life means negation of these material activities. But they have no idea that similar activities are there in spiritual life, but that is not material. That is their poor fund of knowledge. Therefore we are... You are not understandingCaitanya-caritāmṛta,therādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtīvhlādinī-śaktirasmāt.That I am explaining for the last few days. That is not at all this material. So unless there is loving affair in the spiritual world, how here it is as perverted reflection? It is the reflection of the reality. The reality is there. That they cannot understand. That is also hinted in theBhagavad-gītā,that ""There is another feature, or another nature,""parastasmāttubhāvo 'nyaḥ [Bg.8.20],""which issanātana,is eternal."" Here therasas,on account of being material, they are flickering. But there, realrasais permanent. Here the loving affairs between two parties finish as soon as the bodies finish. But there, there is no question of finishing. Increasing.Ānandambudhi-vardhanam,increasing.Harernāma...[Break]...in reality, ""what I am,"" that can be understood through devotional service, not bykarma,jñāna,yoga.But... Give this example, I mean to say, authoritative statement ofKṛṣṇa, thatbhaktyāmāmabhijānāti[Bg.18.55]."
Pañcadraviḍa,I didn't speak with him. Another devotee did.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,Another devotee spoke with this person.,Prabhupāda," So what is your answer, that you cannot understandKṛṣṇa, asKṛṣṇasays, withoutbhakti."
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, we're.... They might answer that that's all right for understandingKṛṣṇa, but the highest state is to merge with God, and then there's no more living entity, no more God. Everything becomes one.",Prabhupāda," That means you have become more thanKṛṣṇa. One who states like that, he has become more thanKṛṣṇa."
Viṣṇujana; Pañcadraviḍa,"Yes, they believe that.; Not more thanKṛṣṇa. Same asKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda," Oh, he's not... He does not know what isKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays that ""My dearArjuna, you, Me, and all these soldiers, they existed before, and they're existing now, and they will exist in the future."" So where is merging? Merging is suiciding. It is a spiritual suicide. Disgusted with these material affairs... Just like sometimes a man, being disgusted with this material world, he commits suicide, so this merging is also a kind of suicide."
Pañcadraviḍa,ButBrahmanalways exists.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pañcadraviḍa,"Brahmanalways exists. We're not, we're not saying thatBrahmanstops existing. So these, the living entities...",Prabhupāda," Yes, again they will come."
Pañcadraviḍa,They're allBrahman. So they will continue to exist.Brahmandoesn't stop existing.,Prabhupāda," Everything exists. For the time being, he may merge; then again he'll come to enjoy this material body.Āruhya kṛccheṇaparaṁpadaṁtataḥpatantyadhaḥ. Patantyadhaḥ.Even they become merged into the existence ofBrahman, again they come back because there is noāśraya.Just like these air, airplanes or the jets. They have invented very good machine, eighteen thousand miles per hour, going very high, but there is no place. They come down again. That is a fact. What is the use of going so high, eighteen thousand miles per hour, and travel and then again come back. Why do you take unnecessary trouble if you cannot stay there? You migrated from Europe and other countries to America. You got shelter. You stayed there. That colonization was successful. But if you are going to colonize in the moon and there is no place to stay, then why you are spending so much money unnecessarily? What is this foolishness? And they have stopped now. So in this way they are trying to merge into theBrahmaneffulgence, but where to stay? They can stay in theBrahmaneffulgence as minute particle of soul, but the soul wantsananda,then again—""It was better to live in the material world."" They come back again. That is statement of theśāstra. Āruhya kṛccheṇaparaṁpadaṁtataḥpatantyadhaḥ.They may go very high, same way as the jets are going, but there is no shelter. Shelter is the lotus feet ofKṛṣṇa. So without shelter, they cannot remain there, and because by nature he wantsānanda...Suppose if you remain in the sky for many, many years, would you feel very comfortable? Then you have to come back again. What is the use of being falsely proud—""Now we have invented the machine. We can go eighteen thousand miles per hour and up in the sky""? That's all right, but what is the benefit out of it? Withoutānanda,without society, friendship and love, you cannot be happy in the vacant sky. Then you'll have to seek again—""Give me some shelter. It is all false."""
Madhudviṣa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, a question arose the other day in class if there was a difference betweenBrahman-realizedyogiand aMāyāvādī.",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Madhudviṣa,"Someone like the Kumaras... Were the Kumāras, before they became attracted toViṣṇu, were they Māyāvādīs?",Prabhupāda, Not Māyāvādīs.
Trivikrama,Impersonalists.,Prabhupāda, Impersonalists.
Madhudviṣa,What is the difference between an impersonalist and aMāyāvādī?,Prabhupāda," Very little difference, but still, there is difference."
Trivikrama,Māyāvādīs are offenders.,Prabhupāda," Māyāvādīs means they are speaking that ""Everything ismāyā;Kṛṣṇais alsomāyā.""And impersonalist means they are thinking that ""To merge into theBrahmaneffulgence is better than to keep our personal identity."""
Satsvarūpa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, this Professor Dimmock was going to arrange aVaiṣṇavaconference at which we were going to attend. You yourself was going to be invited with many professors, but I received a report from one of the professors that when they tried to contact other professors, none of them wanted to come because they said, more or less, that we are like fanatics and we wouldn't actually discuss things in a philosophic way, that we would just use the conference to proselytize. So in this way, they're rejecting us from...",Prabhupāda, What is the harm? Let them reject.
Satsvarūpa,We don't need them.,Prabhupāda," Our business will go on, and there will be many professor Dimmocks who will support us. And they are doing that."
Satsvarūpa,We're not going to compromise to...,Prabhupāda, No.
Satsvarūpa; Pañcadraviḍa; Satsvarūpa,"...please them.; This Professor Dimmock, he still supported us?; Yes, he... [Break]",Prabhupāda," TheBhagavad-gītāis read all over the world. So we can better talk on the principles ofBhagavad-gītā.Our philosophy is we presentBhagavad-gītāas it is, without malinterpretation. So we want to defy everyone who is malinterpretingBhagavad-gītā.So we have to follow the authorities. AndBhagavad-gītāis accepted as authority. Otherwise, why they're reading so widely all over the worldBhagavad-gītā?Why not come on this term? Why you catch up so many literature? If, on this basis, there is a conference, that will be profitable, that ""If you acceptBhagavad-gītāas authority or one of the authorities, so you cannot misinterpret the statement in theBhagavad-gītā.""But the Westerners, they are very expert in misinterpreting even their own Bible. We say that if you interpret anyśāstra,either Bible orBhagavad-gītā,then it is no moreśāstra.It is your play toy. By so-called your rascal vote, without any reason and rhythm and rhyme, you can do everything."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,They sometimes say that becauseBhagavad-gītāwas originally in the Sanskrit language...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"...and that because now it's been translated into the English language, there is necessary interpretation.",Prabhupāda," No. Therefore we are giving the original verse, word to word meaning."
Pañcadraviḍa,"Some, some man argued that...",Prabhupāda, Where is the interpretation necessary?
Satsvarūpa,They say we interpret even in the word to word.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,They claim that we interpret even in word to word.,Prabhupāda," But how do you do? Just likedharma-kṣetrekuru-kṣetre[Bg.1.1].Interpret in different way this word,dharma-kṣetrekuru-kṣetre?It cannot be interpreted. And how do youdareto say that ""We can interpret word to word."" In the beginning, you cannot do it."
Pañcadraviḍa,"They clam, then, unless you speak Sanskrit, you have to interpretBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda," No, that means if you are a nonsense, you better remain silent. Don't interpret. It is better not to talk than to talk nonsense. What is the meaning of that interpretation. If you do not know Sanskrit, stop speaking. Why do you make imagination?"
Pañcadraviḍa,"Well, their claim is you have to read theGītāin Sanskrit in order for it to be read as it is.",Prabhupāda," Now, now, in the very beginning it is said,dharma-kṣetrekuru-kṣetre[Bg.1.1].Now interpret. What is your interpretation,dharma-kṣetre?What is your interpretation,kuru-kṣetre?Come on, in the beginning. They cannot interpret anything."
Santoṣa,"In that verse,aparyāptambhīmābhirakṣitam...",Prabhupāda, Eh? Eh?
Santoṣa,"That verse,aparyāptaṁbhīmābhirakṣitam.",Prabhupāda, Yes?
Santosa,"They make so many interpretations of that word,aparyaptam.",Prabhupāda," How they can...?Aparya...It is... The other party says that ""Bhīma is not so expert fighter."" He was speaking to Bhīṣmadeva that ""You are so nice, expert commander.Bhīmais not so expert commander. Therefore even they have got some soldiers, they'll not be properly guided."" This is the real meaning. How you can interpret? What is their interpretation?"
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,They are simply making excuses.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,But in the end they'll have to surrender toKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (end)
Haṁsadūta,"In Ireland, the devotees go there. The Catholics and the Protestants are always fighting. But everybody likes the devotees.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,Both sides.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta,"They have, they... As soon as they come on the scene, they begin to become jolly.",Prabhupāda, So why don't you take advantage of this?
Haṁsadūta; Satsvarūpa,"Yeah, we do... [break]; ...it's no longer logical. But by the same logic...",Prabhupāda," No, it is... That is the meaning of God. Everything comes from Him, but He's self-sufficient. That is God."
Brahmānanda,But they say that the chunk was always there.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Brahmānanda,They say the chunk was always there.,Prabhupāda," No, chunk was not always there. Just like the earth was not always there. It was covered by water. A chunk is nothing but an earth, a piece of earth. So... So there was no chunk. Everything was covered with water. Wherefrom the chunk came? Wherefrom the water came? Then wherefrom the fire came? There are so many things."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"They think that we are limiting God by saying that He's a person, or that He has form.",Prabhupāda," That is their foolishness. That is their foolishness. They are thinking God a person like me, like himself. That is foolishness. They cannot conceive that a person can become so powerful than myself. That is the defect. A person hasacintya-śakti,acintya-śakti,inconceivable power. Now, just like you are person. You cut your hair. It is growing. Do you know how it is growing?"
Haṁsadūta,No.,Prabhupāda," Then? Even it is beyondyourconception, what to speak of others. But it is growing. It is... If there is any scar or if the nail is broken some way or other, it will come out. But... You cannot manufacture it by conceiving. But it is coming out. That means within you there is an inconceivable power. So if you have got, an ordinary human being, so much inconceivable power, how much God has got inconceivable power. That is God."
Haṁsadūta,"In Los Angeles, you called it mystic power, that every living creature has some mystic power.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Every living creature.
Trivikrama,You gave the example of a lemon tree.,Prabhupāda, Yes. The mystic power producing tons of citric acid.
Trivikrama,Citric acid.,Prabhupāda," Yes, lemon juice.Acintya-śakti,inconceivable power. The cow, eating grass, producing milk—this is inconceivable power. Can you produce milk from the grass? But how the cow is producing? Hmm? Answer this. You eat grass and produce milk. Give your wife grass and let her produce milk. [break] Your question is answered? Eh?"
Satsvarūpa,"Well, it's answered, but they would say that our saying that... You said... I said, ""Where did God come from?"" You say that is the definition of God.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Satsvarūpa,But then they can say...,Prabhupāda," Everything comes from God, but He's self-sufficient. That is God. That is the searching out God, that you search... You... Wherefrom you came? From your father. Then your father comes from his father, from his father. Go on, go on. When you reach one person—he does not come from any father; he is self-sufficient—then He's God. That is the definition of... If God also comes like you, from a father, then how He is God? He's like you. That is the difference."
Satsvarūpa,But they say that's not logically proved.,Prabhupāda," That is logical... Means you have no brain to understand. That's all. That is the distinction between God and ourself. We are caused, but He is cause of all causes. That is God. Otherwise, how you'll distinguish between you and God? You are caused, but He is not caused. He's causeless. If He becomes caused, then He becomes like you. Then how He becomes God? That is the distinction between God and ourself. In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,in the beginning it is said,svarāt."
Satsvarūpa,Independent.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Janmādyasyayataḥ: [SB1.1.1]""This Absolute Truth is that from which, who is the origin of everything, but He'ssvarāṭ."" This is the first line ofBhāgavata. Janmādyasyayataḥanvayātitarataścaartheṣuabhijñaḥsvarāṭ[SB1.1.1]."
Satsvarūpa,"They don't like it because God doesn't come under their jurisdiction, then.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,They want... They want God to be under their jurisdiction. So...,Prabhupāda, That is their foolishness. You shall be under the jurisdiction of God. God is not under your jurisdiction. Then how He is God?
Rāmeśvara,They can't understand how it is that matter... They accept that matter always existed. They can't understand our point...,Prabhupāda, Matter existed...?
Rāmeśvara,"Always. That in the beg..., that eternally there is gas in the atmosphere, in the universe.",Prabhupāda, Wherefrom the gas came?
Rāmeśvara,"Well, they say... They believe that it always existed.",Prabhupāda, Always existing.
Rāmeśvara; Satsvarūpa,"Yes, that's their idea.; Just like we say God issvarāṭ,they say that the matter issvarāṭ.",Prabhupāda," Yes, in... Notsvarāṭ.We never find a gas issvarāṭ,matter issvarāṭ.They... Just this body. Has this body come out itself? Because the soul is there, the body has developed. Therefore the cause of this body is the soul. The body is not independent. And the soul goes away. Then body's no more independent. It cannot move. It becomes just like dust. ""Dust thou art; dust thou be-est."" [break] ...like this body is moving now, but it is not independent. It is dependent on the soul. The soul goes away; it does not move. So how it is independent? And everyone knows that because the soul takes shelter within the womb of the mother, the body develops. If the child comes out dead, it does not develop. Therefore matter is dependent on the soul, living being."
Rāmeśvara,"Their argument is that matter is always in motion, that it is always moving.",Prabhupāda, Where is moving? This is moving?
Rāmeśvara,"Well they say the atoms, the molecules, are always in motion.",Prabhupāda," No, no. First of all prove that this is moving. Then all, say all this nonsense. First of all, why it is not moving? This, this piece of earth, why it is not moving?"
Viṣṇujana,They say it's moving very slowly. You can't see it moving.,Prabhupāda, Eh? Eh?
Viṣṇujana,"It's moving so slow, you can't see it.",Prabhupāda, Then you become blind. Then you can see.
Devotee,"But they'll say the whole world is moving, the whole cosmic manifestation is moving.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is another thing. But then how that is moving, we have to settle. But matter, as itself, does not move."
Rāmeśvara,"'Cause they say that within the, within the earth...",Prabhupāda, That is within. You have got very good sight within. But I am a layman. I want to see that it is moving. (laughter) You have got some imaginary eyes. You can see.
Madhudviṣa,They say that's advancement.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Madhudviṣa,Advancement of science.,Prabhupāda," Yes, to become blind is advancement, certainly. When this is... Who will say it is moving unless he's a fool? Nonsense. (laughter) Moving, that's all right. Everyone... The whole world is moving. That is another thing. But as it is, why, where it is moving?"
Rāmeśvara,"They're talking about the atomic structure, that the atoms are moving.",Prabhupāda, And therefore it is moving.
Rāmeśvara,"Within, the atoms, there is movement.",Prabhupāda," Then here, today, this morning, you'll see it is lying there. Tomorrow you'll come. You'll see it is lying there. Where it is moving? What does it mean by moving?"
Rāmeśvara,"Well, they say that when atoms...",Prabhupāda," They say! You say what it is. Don't say ""They say."" You use your intelligence. If the foolish man says something, shall I have to accept it? You use your own intelligence. ""They say."" If they are authority, then we have got authority. If you do not accept my authority, why shall I accept your authority? Come to argument. ""They say."" Why we will accept ""They say""? They... Why? Are they authority?"
Rāmeśvara,No.,Prabhupāda," Then? What is the use of ""They say""? You say. When you'll say ""They say,"" I'll say ""They say,"" (laughter) my authorities. My authorities. If you defy my authority, why shall I accept your authority? Then come to plain logic."
Madhudviṣa,"Well, you look at the earth, and you see it. It is stationary.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Madhudviṣa,"Just like we look at the building over there. From a distance, it is stationary. But if we go inside, we can see there is so much movement.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Madhudviṣa,"So similarly, you may walk by this earth every day and see it is stationary, but if you analyze it underneath a microscope, you will see that there is so much movement going on within.",Prabhupāda," But that is due to air. That is due to air. Just like we can see so many atoms are moving in the hole from the wall, but that is due to air. So this is also moving. The whole thing is moving by air."
Viṣṇujana,But not of itself.,Prabhupāda, Not automatically.
Viṣṇujana,Not of itself.,Prabhupāda," Not automatically. You cannot say automatically. No, air is moving. Just like the, in the air, the cloud is moving. The cloud is not moving. The air, moving, and the cloud moving."
Trivikrama,"Anyway, the basic proposition is that they, they don't have, they don't want to accept God, so they don't have to be accountable for their activities.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Trivikrama,So that they don't have to be accountable for their activities.,Prabhupāda," Certainly. And they are being accountable. If they become so dull-headed, then God's power will make him a tree: ""Stand here. Stand up here for three thousand years. That's all. You are so dull-headed that you have no sense, so become a tree so that even if you are cut, you cannot protest. You have no sense, senses."" That is the punishment. ""If you don't eatprasādam,then eat stool."" This is the arrangement. So they are being punished. But they are so dull-headed, they cannot understand."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"With their science, they've been able to build so many buildings and roads and bridges and so many things which they consider wonderful.",Prabhupāda," And what you'll do with the buildings? You'll be kicked out. Your building will remain there. Your spoiling labor will remain there, but you will be kicked out. You cannot live there. Who is managing these affairs? ""So you have constructed a building? All right, I kick you out. Get out!"" Then what is the purpose of building? If you know that ""I am constructing this high building, and tomorrow somebody will kick me out,"" then what is the use? Have you made it insured that you'll not be kicked out?"
Viṣṇujana,No.,Prabhupāda, Then it is useless waste of time.
Madhudviṣa,"You can enjoy it while you are here, though.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. That is called foolishness, that ""I am going to be kicked out tomorrow, and let me enjoy tonight."" That's all. That is foolishness."
Madhudviṣa,This is their only recourse 'cause they don't believe in anything after this life.,Prabhupāda," Yes. They... That... ""Don't believe"" means, don't take knowledge means, foolishness. Yes. Just like you are walking. You don't believe that you are going to the temple, but simply walking. Is that very intelligent? We are going. We are going to some place. We know that. That is intelligent. And if I ask you, ""Why you are walking?"" ""That I do not know."" Is that very intelligent man?"
Satsvarūpa,Like animal.,Prabhupāda," Animal, that's all. Animal also knows that ""I'll have to go there."" Without any aim, without any purpose, if they are working, they are fool number one,mūḍhāḥ."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Sometimes the argument is put forward that in places where's there is not sufficient food and shelter and things like this, these problems should be solved first before the problem of spiritual life.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Why don't you solve? There are so many land. Come here and grow food. Grow fruit. That is... That is the desire ofKṛṣṇa.Annādbhavantibhūtāni[Bg.3.14].Produce food and eat in sufficiently, be strong, and chantHareKṛṣṇa. That is our philosophy. Why you are producing bolts and nuts,tireand tubes? Eat. Rascal. They do not know that first of all you must eat. No, everyone is engaged in industry. Why?Kṛṣṇadoes not say that ""Take to industry.""Kṛṣṇasays, ""Produce foodstuff.""Annādbhavantibhūtāni.If you produce foodstuff, then both your animals, yourself, will be happy, becoming strong. Why do they manufacture other things? All these people are engaged in manufacturing, and nobody ismanu..., er, growing food. Therefore the price of food grain is rising. Suppose I am growing food, and you are not growing, so you have to purchase from me. I'll ask, ""You have to pay this price."" And you have to pay. And if you grow your own food, there is no such question. The simple economic problem, solution, this rascal cannot take. If you grow your own food, I grow my own, then who is going to purchase? The price will be reduced automatically. If you have no customer, then you have to reduce your price. But they do not understand even the simple thing that ""God has given us enough land to produce food grain, and we must eat."" They do not understand this. And still, they are scientist, philosopher, politician. Just see. That is the difficulty. All rascals, fools, they are leading the whole human society."
Rāmeśvara,They're too busy making money to grow their own food.,Prabhupāda," ""So then pay more money. Come on. You have earned money and give me. I shall give you food. And whatever I shall ask, you have to pay."" This simple thing, more demand-price is more. Then why do you gripe, ""Oh, everything is price growing, price growing."" Why it will not? If I have got food, and you have to purchase, and I have got so many customers, I must increase. That is economic theory: more demand—the price is increased. And then you say, ""There are so many problems. We have to solve first."" But you have created this problem, rascal. And you shall must suffer. You have infected some disease. Now you must suffer. It is like say,kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya [Bg.13.22].The reason is that you have infected some quality of the modes of nature and you must suffer for that. How you can deny it? If you have infected some disease like cholera, smallpox, and when you are suffering, how you can blaim? You have infected. You must suffer. Nature's law is so strict that as soon as you infect a particular type of quality of nature—there are so many—you must suffer for that, or so-called enjoy. There are two things, suffer and enjoy. So you must have to undergo the process. This is... Nature's process is so nice. As soon as you do something, there is reaction and you are bound up.Yajñārthekarmaanyatraloko 'yaṁkarmabandhanaḥ[Bg.3.9].Bandhanaḥmeans bound up. Immediately you become bound up. And still, you are thinking, ""Independent."" The nature's law is so strict."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"But the argument is that ""The cities are there, and now what can we do?""",Prabhupāda, Hm ?
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,The cities are already there. There are millions of people in the cities...,Prabhupāda," Therefore we are offering this place. Come here. Why do you not come here and live with us? Then this is... TheKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is... This is the movement, that you come here, live with us, and produce your food, produce your milk, be happy, healthy, and chantHareKṛṣṇa. This is our movement. Therefore we are creating New Vrindaban and farm, and we are trying to purchase... This is our movement, that we give you sufficient food, shelter, health, philosophy, religion, character, everything, purity. Come here. Why don't you come? They come here on the weekdays, and then fly away, go away. You see? We are giving such nice room, but they will not live here. They will go to the hubble-bubble of the city. They like to come here. Therefore they spend so much money for gas and come here. But because they are not accustomed, they go back again. Return ticket. From hell to heaven, and again hell (laughter) Return ticket-coming back to hell again, not going back to God."
Satsvarūpa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said there was a man who read yourEasy Journey,and he was very enthusiastic that he could go to other planets.",Prabhupāda," But you must come back. He said, ""Oh, I am not coming back again?"" ""No."" ""No, no, then I don't want."" Yes, that is the psychology. The Russians, when some aeronaut was flying high in the sky, he was seeing: ""Where is my Moscow?"" Yes, it was published. That ismāyā.The... Another incidence happenned that when the jet was in danger, he was thinking of ""How to come back home?"" This ismāyā.Cannot go. Even though you like to go, still, it will attract you again, back to hell. Otherwise, how people are living in—what is called? That place where is ice?"
Haṁsadūta; Brahmānanda; Jagadisa,Alaska.; Greenland.; North Pole?,Prabhupāda, What is the name of those people?
Devotees,Eskimos.,Prabhupāda," Eskimos. Is that very good living? Just see. They won't come here. This ismāyā.This ismāyā.Āvaraṇātmikā-śakti.They, he's living in hell butmāyāis covering: ""No, it is not hell; it is heaven."" This ismāyā.Similarly all of us, we are living in this universe, material universe. We are thinking ""This is all good. What is the use of God and going back to home, back to Godhead?"" They do not take it very seriously. Although we give all information that ""You'll haven't, you haven't got to work there. You'll get everything. Your life is eternal and blissful, and full of knowledge,"" they are not interested. Plugged."
PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,Plugged.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Plugged ear, er, ears, yes. ""You go on speaking, but I have plugged my ear."" (laughter)"
Trivikrama,"""Chant, chant, chant.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. ""Can't, can't, can't."" That's it. (laughter) This is going on. The best intelligence is that ""We are hearing so much about the spiritual world; there is so much happiness. Why not try one life? Like cats and dogs, I have tried so many lives. Why not sacrifice one life? Where is the loss there?"" But no, they are so many, fallen, they'll not accept."
Satsvarūpa,"One man wrote a book about our movement,HareKṛṣṇa, and he said one tragedy of this movement is that if a young boy or girl takes to this movement and later decides to try the material world again, he will have ruined his chances for a career, (laughter) and it'll be too late for him.",Prabhupāda, Hm.
Trivikrama; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,That's a fact.; Nehābhikrama-nāśo 'sti...[Bg.2.40].,Prabhupāda," ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣukaścidyatatisiddhaye: [Bg.7.3]""Out of many millions of people, one may become interested about what is the perfection of life."" They do not want. ""And out of such millions of persons,""yatatāmapisiddhānām[Bg.7.3],""who was trying for perfection of life, out of many millions of them, one can understand Me,Kṛṣṇa.""māyāis so strong.Manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣukaścidyatatisiddhaye.Everything is there in theBhagavad-gītā.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness is not for ordinary person. Most fortunate,bhāgyavānjīva...Guru-kṛṣṇakṛpayapāyabhakti-latā-bīja[Cc.Madhya19.151].All these living entities, wandering throughout the universe...Eirūpebrahmāṇḍabhramite.If one gets the chance ofguruandKṛṣṇa, then he can understand. And if still one argues, then he's again misfortunate. ThereforeKṛṣṇademands, ""You rascal, don't argue! Surrender!""Sarva-dharmānparityajamām...That is the way. He commands."
Devotee,"Actually, you were asking if there were any examples of explosions happenning without material cause, and I was just wondering if you could explain how volcanoes explode.",Prabhupāda," Hm? That is God's desire, nature's way. Nature is behind this, and behind nature..."
Devotee,Through the demigods?,Prabhupāda," No. Nature, the material nature, and... Just like in... Sometimes at night you have got, what is called, pollution, night pollution?"
Trivikrama,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So why it is happenning? Why it is happenning? Why this eruption comes? Can you explain?
Devotee; Trivikrama; Devotee,I don't know what night pollution is.; Passing semina in sleep.; Oh.,Prabhupāda, Why it does happen? What is your explanation? Nobody can explain?
Rāmeśvara; PuṣṭaKṛṣṇa,"Desire in the heart, subtle desire.; It is nature, just...",Prabhupāda," No, no, nature... The body is made of material nature, and the eruption is coming. Why it is coming? Does it come in the dead body?"
Devotee,No.,Prabhupāda, Then? What is the cause?
Paramahaṁsa,"The soul, living entity.",Prabhupāda," Because the soul is there. Similarly, the Supersoul is there, and He's arranging everything. The volcano's eruption does not take automatically. When it is desired byKṛṣṇa, then it takes place.Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg.9.10].Why don't you readBhagavad-gītā.""Under My superintendence."" When He knows that ""Now this eruption is required,"" immediately there is...Parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65, purport].He has got so many potencies. One potency works. That's all. Because the living soul is there, therefore the seminal discharge takes place. Similarly, because the supreme living is there, therefore all these things are happenning. Where is the difficulty to understand?Kṛṣṇasays,viṣṭabhyāhamidaṁkṛtsnamekāṁśena sthitojagat: [Bg.10.42]""The whole worldly affair is going on because I am there.""Viṣṭabhya:""I have entered into it."" Don't you read in theBhagavad-gītā?Then? And we are reading that portion, how KaranavasayiViṣṇuenters in the each universe. He's... Then He expands Himself as KśīrodakaśāyīViṣṇu. We are explaining that.Kṛṣṇasays inBhagavad-gītā,viṣṭabhya.Viṣṭabhyameans entering."
Brahmānanda,You have written thatMahā-Viṣṇuhas some attraction to the material world?,Prabhupāda," No, He has no attraction. You have got attraction. Therefore He creates.Mahā-Viṣṇuknows, orKṛṣṇaknows that ""These rascals will have attraction for this material... All right, let Me arrange."" He has no attraction. Why He'll have attraction?"
Brahmānanda,So one of the devotees said they read that in one of the books.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Satsvarūpa,"There is one purport that says thatKṛṣṇais different thanViṣṇubecause He's not, He has nothing to do with the material world.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,"ButMahā-Viṣṇu, He has some attraction, or...?",Prabhupāda," No attraction. He is duty... He is, what is called, duty-bound, assigned byKṛṣṇa, or He's not ordered.Kṛṣṇaexpands inMahā-Viṣṇuand takes charge of this affair."
Rāmeśvara,Śrīla Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Rāmeśvara,"Before I was asking about the scientific theory that the atoms are always moving, and you said that the earth is not moving now.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Rāmeśvara,You said that the... You pointed to a chunk and said that it is not moving. But they're...,Prabhupāda," But if you..., then you are also moving. Everything is moving because you are on the earth. When the train moves, everything moves. But how it moves, train? That you have to search out. Train is not automatically moving. Some power, engine, is moving it. That is blind vision, that ""Train is moving."" How the train is moving? You have to see. That is childish. Train is not moving. The engine is moving the train. And how the engine is moving? The coal, fire, is moving. Then wherefrom the coal come? In this way, you have to search out. You'll find, ultimately, the supreme cause isKṛṣṇa. Nothing is moving without Kṛṣṇa's indication. That is the explanation,"
Brahmānanda,Buses?,Prabhupāda, Yes. In Darwin.
Devotees,"Oh, in that, that cyclone, cyclone...",Prabhupāda, Yes. And whole city smashed.
Rāmeśvara,"They don't know how to search beyond the microscopic level, microscope level. They think that the atoms have their own energy. They don't know the process of searching...",Prabhupāda, The energy is:Kṛṣṇais there.Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham[Bs.5.35].Theasura'sbusiness is to avoidKṛṣṇa. That is their business. And our business is to establish everywhereKṛṣṇa. That is the difference between them and ourself.
