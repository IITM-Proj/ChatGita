Amogha,"In verses like this one, when there is the multi-use of one word, like the wordātmāis mentioned here to refer to four potential meanings. Sometimes professors and some scholars argue on the point, how do we know which one of the meanings is used in this verse?",Prabhupāda," Any one you can take, and it will be explained."
Amogha,So any of the four meanings is also the same true meaning.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,"Sometimes they claim that we should not claim that our choice is the true choice, but they don't understand that any of those meanings can be true at the same time.",Prabhupāda," Yes, this body is true. We have got body. We don't say it is false. It is true. Bodily pains and pleasures we feel, so how can I say that the body is false? The body means bodily pains and pleasures, then we are affected, so how you can say it is false? Similarly the mind, and soul is absolute thing. Factually. So any item you take, you can understand by thorough study."
Paramahaṁsa,"In some cases, in a more controversial case, the word chosen, or the meaning chosen for a particular Sanskrit word, may change the whole meaning of the verse, but because...",Prabhupāda," Therefore you have to take theparamparāmeaning. Because we are foolish, we cannot understand properly.Tadvijñārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet.Therefore, one has to go toguruand understand the meaning byparamparā.You cannot make your own meaning. The meaning is already there. But if you cannot understand, then you should approachguruand understand the meaning byparamparā."
Paramahaṁsa,"Sometimes people ask where Swami Prabhupāda get his meanings for different words, because they would differ, they would disagree and pick some other word. But they don't know that you are simply taking the verse and the meaning of the words word for word, as the previousācāryashave done.",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇasays. You take that meaning. Where is the difficulty? You do not know, and neither you accept Kṛṣṇa's words. Therefore you remain foolish. You foolishly... First of all you do not know, you are imperfect. And one who knows, you do not take his words. Then you remain foolish. What can we do? What is the answer? You are foolish. So you have to know from others. When we say that you take from others who are perfect, then you will not take. And you are foolish, so remain foolish. What can we do? Hmm?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Sometimes people ask, though, they say, ""Why is it that even among theācāryassometimes we find there is a difference of opinion?""",Prabhupāda," They are notācāryas.They are notācāryas.There is no difference of understanding betweenācāryas.What Madhvācārya understands, we also understand. Suppose you are present also. So there is no difference. What Rāmānujācārya understands, we also understand. WhatCaitanyaMahāprabhuunderstand, we also understand. So where is the difference? Difference should be that the fact that he is notācārya.As soon as he differs from the previousācāryas,that means he is notācārya.Otherwise there is full agreement between all theācāryas.Just likeKṛṣṇais the Supreme Person, allācāryasagree. Where is the difference? Does Rāmānujācārya differ from Madhvācārya, or Madhvācārya differ from ŚrīCaitanya,Caitanyadiffers from—no. There is no difference. That isVaiṣṇava. All the Vaiṣṇavas understand thatViṣṇuis the Supreme. There may be, sometimes, such asKṛṣṇais understood as incarnation ofViṣṇu, and sometimes they understandViṣṇuas the incarnation ofKṛṣṇa. That issampradāya.That issampradāya.But eitherKṛṣṇaorViṣṇu, He is Supreme, that is accepted by all."
Paramahaṁsa,So that point is not so important whetherKṛṣṇais coming fromViṣṇuorViṣṇuis coming fromKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is not important. Because, actually both of them the same, the Supreme. That example we give that candle, two candles, that so far the power of lighting is concerned, both of them equal. Now, you may say this is first candle, I say if it is first candle. But so far the power is concerned, there is no difference of opinion. If I love somebody, I'll say he is first. And if you love somebody, you'll say he is first. But both of them same. Just like devotees, some devotees are very... Hanumanji, he'll never acceptKṛṣṇa. And thegopīswill never acceptRāmaorViṣṇu. So far theKṛṣṇaandViṣṇu, they are all the same. What do you think?"
Paramahaṁsa,"I think perhaps (indistinct) So actually the differences, whatever little differences may arise, those differences amongst theācāryas,they are due to different feelings of love forKṛṣṇaor His manifestations.",Prabhupāda," You'll find in some, among some devotees, they will criticize, ""Why you are worshipingRāmacandra? He could not save even His wife."" (laughter) And some will, ""Ah, you are worshipingKṛṣṇa. He was so fond of women."" Like that. InVṛndāvanayou'll find they are different. Somebody will say, ""HareKṛṣṇa,"" another will say, ""SītāRāma."" There will be competition. There is not difference. Both of them know that either I worshipRāmaorKṛṣṇa, They are the same."
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? Here it mentionsBrahmān, and as I understoodoṁkāra...My question is whetheroṁkārais a representation...",Prabhupāda," There is no question aboutoṁkārathere. Discuss on the verse. Butoṁkārais alsoKṛṣṇa.Praṇavaḥsarvavedeṣu. Raso 'hamapsukaunteyapraṇavaḥsarvavedeṣu[Bg.7.8].Kṛṣṇasays, ""I ampraṇavaḥ."" Sooṁkārais not different thanKṛṣṇa. Butoṁkārais pronounced by the impersonalists. That is the difference.Kṛṣṇa, when He says that ""I ampraṇavaḥ,I amoṁkāra,"" then where is the objection? They foolishly say thatoṁkārais better thanKṛṣṇa. There is no need of chanting ""Kṛṣṇa."" That is not good. But so far we are concerned, we say there is no difference betweenoṁkāraandKṛṣṇa. Other systems, Christianism or Buddhism or Mohamedanism, they have got one book,Koran, Bible,or... What is the Buddhist scripture? One book. And we have got so many, dealing with the same subject matter. So which is better? Higher mathematics, or two plus two? They should understand the gravity of this movement, my presentation of books. They haven't got so many books. Two thousand years past, the Christian religion has got only one book,Bible.And their only pastime of Christ is crucifixion. There is the cross. Therefore it has become hackneyed. People are no more interested. Neither they can explain very nicely. Neither they follow strictly whatever little information they have. Then?"
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,Next verse?; ...Madhusūdanabecause He killed the demonMadhu. But who was thatMadhu?,Prabhupāda," A demon, it is said."
Paramahaṁsa,But I don't think we've heard that story before.,Prabhupāda," In the beginning, whenBrahmāwas created, one demon,Madhu, came to swallow him. AndKṛṣṇakilled him.Madhu-Kaitava, two brothers,MadhuandKaitava."
Paramahaṁsa,He came to swallowBrahmā?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,So he was one of the first demons killed.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,May we ask questions about pronouncing the Sanskrit?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,"When the a-h with the dot is in the middle of the verse should it always be pronounced clearly, a-ha.Adhi-yajña-ha,or is it more likeadhi-yajña.",Prabhupāda, That is stated there. In the verse what it is?
Amogha,"Adhi-yaj...Well, it depends on whether I pronounce it right. (laughs) But it is spelled, a-d-h-i-y-a-j-n-a-h with a dot underneath. So...",Prabhupāda," Adhi-yajña.When we divide the word, then the first noun form is used. Sanskrit grammar is very difficult. It requires twelve years to learn simply Sanskrit grammar. So, that is not possible. So whatever is there, you understand that. Sanskrit grammar is very, very difficult. At least twelve years it requires. And if you understand Sanskrit grammar, then you can read all the Vedic literature without any translation. Simply by studying. Therefore the Sanskrit scholars are first of all taught grammar. And when one is expert in reading grammar properly, then all Vedic literature becomes very simplified."
Amogha,"The Supersoul, does He... I remember in one place it describes that the Lord is so small that He can enter even into the heart of the individual soul, and...",Prabhupāda, Even into the atom. So where is the difficulty?
Amogha,"Well sometimes it is described that the Supersoul is situated beside the individual soul. So He's beside the individual soul, not inside the individual soul.",Prabhupāda," Inside does not mean He is not beside. We are inside this room, that does not mean I an not beside the room. Because I live within the room, does it mean that the room and myself are the same? Then, why don't you understand this? God may be within anything, but that does not mean that He is equal or one with that thing. That isMāyāvādīphilosophy, foolish philosophy. Because I am within this room, does it mean that the room and myself are the same? I am more important than the room. So what is the difficulty to understand? Does it mean because I am within the room, I am less important than the room? The room is important or I am important? Who is important?"
Amogha,You are.,Prabhupāda," So similarly,Kṛṣṇamay enter within anything, but still He is more important than anything. This is simultaneous.Aṇḍāntarasthaṁparamāṇu-cayāntarastham—Kṛṣṇais within and without. That is Kṛṣṇa's position.Antaḥbahiḥavasthitam—in Kunti's prayers you will find thatKṛṣṇa, ""You are within, and you are without, still nobody can understand."" That is stated. What is our experience? Within and without. ButKṛṣṇais both, within and without, and still we do not see.Naṭo nāṭyadharoyathā—just like a person playing on the stage, and his relatives and others they cannot understand that Mr. Such-and-such is playing. They are seeing something else. He is playing before them, he is known to them, but he still cannot understand. This example is given,naṭo nāṭyadharoyathā.So Kuntīdevī explained this. Did you not read Kunti's prayer?Kuntisays,antarbahiravasthitaḥ.""You are situated within and without. Everywhere you are."" But still the foolish men cannot understand. And why they cannot?Naṭo nāṭyadharoyathā.Just like one's father is playing on the stage, but because he is playing in a different role, or dressing in a different role, even the son cannot understand. So what is the difficulty? Hmm? Difficulty is mind; otherwise there is no difficulty. I am foolish, therefore... OtherwiseKṛṣṇais visible to everyone. We have got two kinds of experience, within and without. He is present within and without, but still we cannot seeKṛṣṇa. That ismyfoolishness, that ismyimperfection. We have to become perfect, then we will seeKṛṣṇaeverywhere. That is morningsādhana,spiritual consciousness, advancement. The more we advance in spiritual consciousness,Kṛṣṇawe'll realize more and more.Svayamevasphuratyadhaḥ:you cannot seeKṛṣṇa, but as soon as you become purified, He reveals Himself. It is not due to you that you can see. WhenKṛṣṇaallows Himself to be seen by you, then you can see. So you have to become qualified to see Him; otherwise He is everywhere present, we can't see Him. And without being qualified, if you want to see Him, that is not possible.Nāhaṁprakāśaḥsarvasyayoga-māyāsamāvṛtaḥ[Bg.7.25].Find out this verse."
Paramahaṁsa,"In this connection you have quoted LordBrahmā, saying that... LordBrahmāsays that the great material scientists, they may be able to calculate the atomic structure of the material world and the planetary system, but even ifKṛṣṇais standing right in front of them, they can't calculate His potencies.",Prabhupāda," Vivekananda liked to say, he challenged Ramakrishna, ""Can you show me God?"" He said, ""Yes,"" and he showed him God and then he became disciple."
Paramahaṁsa,"They're saying that thisBalYogeshwara, people ask him ""Can you show what is God,"" and he says, ""Oh, yes,"" then he shows them.",Prabhupāda," Where he is now, thisBalYogeshwara?"
Paramahaṁsa,"I don't know where he is. There was one article about him recently, but they didn't say where he was. I think he was rejected. Maybe he is trying to start his own movement. But as far as his Divine Light Mission, he is kicked out.",Prabhupāda, Kicked out by whom? By mother.
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes, mother.",Prabhupāda, Mother is authority.
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Just see.
Paramahaṁsa,They say that the main reasons that she gave for kicking him out were that he was going to nightclubs and dancing and drinking and eating meat.,Prabhupāda," So he was doing all, everything."
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes. So she said, ""Oh, he is notHindu,"" according to them.",Prabhupāda, Then you cannot be God. (laughter)
Paramahaṁsa,"So she said instead my other son is God. He is very... Also she was a little angry becauseGuruMaharaj-ji's wife, that American wife that he got, who used to be his secretary—after they were married, in all the temples, their ashrams all over the world, they used to have thatBalYogeshwara's picture and then his mother's picture. But now they took the mother's picture down and put the wife's picture up. So the mother was very angry. Therefore she kicked them both out, and now her picture and another son is on the altar.",Prabhupāda, Another son. So they're accepting.
Paramahaṁsa,"Oh, yes. He was actually popular anyway, the other son. He was almost as popular asBalYogeshwara. He's the older son. He's a jazz musician, so they like it.",Prabhupāda, Jazz? What is that jazz?
Paramahaṁsa,American music. Something like rock and roll. It is modern music.,Prabhupāda," Hmm. So, how he learned? He is Indian."
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, I don't know, but he's pretty good. His band was very popular in America.",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Paramahaṁsa,"They were very popular. THey would travel around and do performances, and thousands of people would come. He had quite a big group of musicians, and he was the leader. He would lead the whole group. He would play the trumpet and sometimes dance.",Prabhupāda," Hmm. Then,RaviShankar is no more popular?"
Paramahaṁsa,Most people think he's too puffed up.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Otherwise how they say he's God? Then? You can stop. Those who are tired can take rest. What is the local time?
Amogha,8:30,Prabhupāda, 8:30?
Paramahaṁsa,"Usually people don't have a very clear idea of what spiritual life is. So when they see someone who is a good musician or a good artist or something like that, sometimes they automatically think, ""Oh, he must be spiritual, because he is so good at this. No one else can do it. He must be some spiritual power."" So therefore someone likeRaviShankar, a lot of people either they become envious or they worship him as being an incarnation or something like that.",Prabhupāda," That is also stated,yadyadvibhūtimatsattvaṁ."
Devotees; Paramahaṁsa,HareKṛṣṇa. (offer obeisances) (end); They can bring a dog if he's on a leash.,Prabhupāda," Nobody can. I have seen in Los Angeles. (pause) The water is not very clean. (ducks quacking) We are afraid of water; they're enjoying. (pause) Here we have got gold, copper, somewhere in the mines, but in the sky there are millions of miles land of copper, gold."
Amogha,"Do you mean other planets, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Big, big planets, millions of miles. (pause)"
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? When a spirit soul first falls from the spiritual sky into the material world, does he first go to the lowest of the 8,400,000 species of life, and then gradually come up, or can he fall to the middle or anywhere?",Prabhupāda, According to his desire. In the beginning it is not so fall down.
Śrutakīrti,"In a purport in the Fourth Canto you say that usually they take human forms, because they are desiring to enjoy in that way. And then they begin falling down.",Prabhupāda," Yes, the more they enjoy, the more they become entangled. (pause) Does it snow here?"
Amogha,No. In the mountains.,Prabhupāda," Mountains. (pause) ...it is said that sun is the source of everything within this universe. Maintenance of all living entities. The source within the universe is the sun. Therefore thisGāyatrīmantrais worshiping the sun,oṁbhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥtatsaviturvareṇyaṁbhargodevasyadhīmahi."
Gaṇeśa,Does that mean thatVivasvānis more powerful than LordBrahmā?,Prabhupāda, No.Vivasvānwas begotten byBrahmā.
Amogha,SomeKali-yugaswans.,Prabhupāda," Black swans.Bharanityabhayamāyā.They are also aware how to protect their interest. Every living being knows how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, and how to defend from fear. These trees I find in America. Here, they are scented. What is called, these? Canada."
Gaṇeśa,They look like a maple tree.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is maple tree.
Gaṇeśa; Amogha; Paramahaṁsa; Śrutakīrti; Amogha,"I don't think it's quite the same.; No. It's maple tree, but you can't get any maple syrup from this kind. A special kind.; They had this tree where I used to live, also. I don't remember the name of it. In California.; On the airplane coming here they had some article in one of the airline books about eucalyptus trees and how these monks, they make wine out of the eucalyptus. The Trappist monks. Some kind of Trappist monks, they make wine out of the eucalyptus, and they have a big store, and they sell it, in Italy. That's their profession, making different liquors.; Recently we have shown the film and spoken in several Catholic schools in Melbourne. They have comparative religion classes, and they ask us to come to their high schools to teach comparative religion so the students can see what other religions think. Usually they...",Prabhupāda, There is no other religion. All bogus.Dharmaḥprojjhita-kaitavo.Only religion is to surrender toKṛṣṇa. That is religion.
Amogha,"They think that if they sin it's all right, because man is imperfect. So they think we should believe in Jesus.",Prabhupāda," Every animal is imperfect, but man—animal can become perfect. If he likes. So it is very important life."
Śrutakīrti,"They say it's not possible to become perfect, that that's saying ""I can become God.""",Prabhupāda, What?
Śrutakīrti,"They say only God can be perfect, that we cannot become perfect.",Prabhupāda," No, you cannot become as perfect as God, but near about."
Amogha,"There's a verse in theBiblewhich says ""Only he can sin who has come short of the glory of God."" So they say this means if you think you cannot sin, that means that you think you are God. But we say that you can surrender and become perfect.",Prabhupāda," If you surrender to God, then you become perfect."
Amogha,"They seem to like everything about our philosophy, except when we explain very clearly that everyone is sinning and under the control of lust and that we must become free from lust. Then they become disturbed because they don't know how to do this, and they want to disclaim it. Just when I was saying that in one class, they all understood very clearly by examples that we are all controlled by our senses, and this microphone speaker came on for all classes, interrupting my speech, and a voice announced in the Catholic school, ""Would all the students whose parents purchased tickets for the wine-tasting festival tonight please report to the office,"" and they all began to laugh because they were embarrassed, because they could see that actually they were engaged in sinful activities. They are also very amazed when they see your books. Sometimes we take ten or fifteen books-Bhagavad-gītā,and tenŚrīmad Bhāgavatams,Caitanya-caritāmṛta—and we line them all across the front wall or desk, maybe fifteen books. And I begin by saying, ""I'm sorry there's only a few minutes to talk, because ourBibleis very big,"" and then I explain, ""This isBhagavad-gītā,and thenŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam'ssixty volumes.Caitanya-caritāmṛta-twelve volumes."" And they become very much amazed that this is our..., beginning of ourBible.[break] What can we say to Communists to attract them toKṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda," To make their Communist philosophy perfection. That your Communism is not perfect. ByKṛṣṇaconsciousness you can make it perfect. Take for example that you are sympathetic to all living beings that they must eat. But why you are eating animals? They must eat also. Why don't you allow them to eat? That is you defect. We allow everyone to eat. Not only human beings, but also animals, birds, beasts, they should live comfortably and without any disturbance, they must get their food. That is our Communism. But where is your Communism? You are thinking of your countrymen only, or in your country also only for the human being, and you are sending other poor animals, because they cannot protest, to the slaughterhouse. So why do you protest to the capitalists when they send you to the slaughterhouse? You are sending these poor animals to the slaughterhouse. So why do you protest? You protest that the capitalist are slaughtering you. So, if you slaughter others, why should you be afraid of being slaughtered yourself? Is it all right?"
Amogha,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is imperfect. We are alo Communists, but we are perfect Communists. We are thinking of all living beings."
Gaṇeśa,"Some people say that in our philosophy, if we do not wish to slaughter the animals, what about the trees? We are killing the plants. They are also living entities.",Prabhupāda," If you compare the animals and the trees as the same, then why not kill yourself, your brother? Why do you distinguish? Why don't you slaughter your own son? Why do you distinguish?"
Gaṇeśa,He's a relative.,Prabhupāda," You discriminate. If you are slaughtering animals and you are comparing that killing of the vegetables and the killing of the animals is the same, then killing your son and killing an animal is also the same. Why do you discriminate? Just kill your own son and eat."
Paramahaṁsa,"He's a human being, though.",Prabhupāda," Ah, therefore there is discrimination. Discrimination is the better part of valor. Whom should we kill? It is all right.Jīvojīvasyajīvanam.But there is important. If you eat vegetables there is no crisis, you can go on. It is a fact that an animal is eating another animal. It may be vegetables or animals, but they are disturbing. Therefore it is said, ""As it is allotted."" You should eat such and such. Not that indiscriminately you can eat everything. If you think killing of an animal and killing a vegetable is the same, then killing of your son and killing of animals or vegetable is the same. Why do you discriminate? What is your answer?"
Gaṇeśa,"So if we discriminate between the animals and the plants, well what about the discrimination between the human beings and the animals? Is it not all right to kill animals and not human beings?",Prabhupāda," No. You discriminate actually. You do not kill human beings, but you kill animals. Similarly you discriminate: instead of killing animals, kill vegetables. Importance. Just like this grass. There is enough supply of grass, but you cannot have enough supply of cows. Therefore discrimination is that it is better to live on grass than on animals. Now, still they are eating seventy-five percent other than animals. They are not eating only animals. Why not twenty-five percent more? In the market they are not eating animal. When the animal-eaters I see, they have got a little flesh, surrounded by salad and these peas and so many other things. Why don't you eat only meat?"
Śrutakīrti,Because we require a balanced diet.,Prabhupāda," No, you cannot supply. If everyone eats meat only, then one day all animals will be finished."
Paramahaṁsa,"But we want to have a balanced diet with meat, and vegetables and fruit.",Prabhupāda," That balance of diet can be done by grains and vegetables. Why should we kill animals? We know that, the balance can be done. You learn from us that balanced food can be done."
Amogha,But in theBibleit says that God gave animals to the man.,Prabhupāda," For protection. Not for eating. Rascals.Bibledoes not say that you kill animals. Then Jesus Christ is a hypocrite. His commandment is, ""Thou shalt not kill."" If he allows killing, then why does he say, ""Thou shalt not kill""? Then you prove that Jesus Christ is a hypocrite. Are you following a hypocrite? Nonsense."
Paramahaṁsa,"So we understand. We will stop eating meat, but we can still eat fish and eggs. Because there are plenty of fish and plenty of eggs.",Prabhupāda, That is also better than killing animals.
Amogha,Jesus also gave fish to the people in one part of the Bible.,Prabhupāda," When there is no other food, you have to take anything. That is another thing. But when there are other foods, grains and vegetables, why should you eat anything? You have to eat and live. So if you can eat and live innocently, why should you kill? Then, Christ says ""Thou shall not kill."" Was he a fool, rascal, that he advised ""Thou shall not kill""? He had no idea?"
Śrutakīrti,But he meant kill other people.,Prabhupāda," No. That is your interpretation, rascal's interpretation."
Amogha,All the priests say that.,Prabhupāda," He says clearly, ""Thou shall not kill."" And when I cut grass, it is not called killing. You should know dictionary. Because you are uneducated, you do not know the meaning of the dictionary."
Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa,But I'm just a common Christian. I'm following my authority. They say it's all right. The Pope.; He's the supreme authority. The Pope is eating meat.,Prabhupāda," That means from the supreme down to the rascal everyone is rascal. That proves it, that all of you are a set of rascaldom."
Paramahaṁsa,But the government doesn't charge anyone with crime for killing an animal.,Prabhupāda," Government means they are full of rascals. Government by the people. So you are all rascals, the government is also rascal. Your democracy means government by the people for the people. So all the people are rascals, beginning from the Pope down to the common man. Therefore the government is rascal."
Paramahaṁsa,"But not all of us are Christians. Some of us are Muslims, and in theKoranMohammed says that eating meat is all right. In fact it is required to be a good Muslim, to eat meat.",Prabhupāda," They spoke in the desert. What will they eat? But you are not in the desert. Meat-eating is a crude form of eating when people are uncivilized. When there is no other food, you cannot produce. But when you are civilized, when you learn how to produce other foods, why would you eat meat? How are you civilized?"
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Sikhism there wasGuruNanak andGuruGranth Sahib.Is that actually a real scripture, and wasGuruNanak actually a devotee? Or is that not correct?",Prabhupāda, They created a system of religion which can include Hindus and Muslim. That was at the time needed. But that is not a good system of religion.
Paramahaṁsa,You mean a compromise between the two.,Prabhupāda," Compromise, yes. There was too much strain between Hindus and Muslims, so he wanted to make a compromise. Actually there was only Vedic culture all over the world. As the things deteriorated, new systems of religion came in. Either the Sikh religion or the Christian or this religion, Muslim religion. They are, what is called, deformed type of religion. Religion is thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁ[Bg.18.66].That is religion. These are later on deformed."
Gaṇeśa,"So is that according to time, place and circumstance we must discriminate in our eating?",Prabhupāda, What?
Gaṇeśa,"According to time, place and circumstance we must discriminate whether to eat meat, whether to eat the vegetables?",Prabhupāda," Yes, you must eat. But when good things are available, why should you eat bad things? You must be pacified."
Amogha,Was there a story? The Hindus always tell this story about I thinkViśvāmitraṚṣi eating a dog or something?,Prabhupāda, Sometimes. There was no food.
Amogha,They like that story. What about in the Buddhist philosophy; we understand that...,Prabhupāda, No killing.
Paramahaṁsa,...in the higher stage...,Prabhupāda, No killing.
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa; Amogha,"Yes, but the Buddhist monks, when they beg, they simply accept whatever alms they receive, and if they receive meat then they'll eat that, and if they receive some raw grains then they eat that. Actually that is a higher state of renunciation.; And if they receive some cigarettes they'll smoke them.; Yes, and if they receive-they'll take anything, they are so renounced. So isn't that more spiritual?",Prabhupāda, They have no idea what is spiritual. Buddhist religion is not a spiritual. It is material. If you kill me then I feel pain; therefore I shall not kill you. This is.
Amogha,Recently we received a letter from a Chinese man in Singapore. He wants all of your books. He wants to know how much.,Prabhupāda, Oh? You have supplied?
Amogha,"Well I just received it. I will answer him and tell him the cost. I will supply him, yes.",Prabhupāda, Chinese man from?
Amogha,Singapore.,Prabhupāda, Singapore.
Amogha,That is the country that doesn't like us to come in. Just below Malaysia.,Prabhupāda," In the beginning don't talk of these details, just try to convince about the philosophy. What is the nature of God? What is your nature? How we are related, like that."
Paramahaṁsa,By details do you mean the rules and regulations?,Prabhupāda," No, that is not in the beginning. In the beginning one must know that he is not this body. He is spirit soul. Don't bring in controversy, but try to convince that you are not this body. Then, gradually. That is the mode of teaching in theBhagavad-gītā."
Paramahaṁsa,As they become more interested they ask automatically how they can make advancement.,Prabhupāda," If they understand that ""I am spirit soul"" then he'll advance. Then you can say. The chanting is required."
Paramahaṁsa; Amogha,"Andprasādam.; Everyone likesprasādam.In these high schools we takemaṅgalaāratika burfiand they love it. Sometimes the Catholic sisters and nuns come up afterwards and say, ""How do you make this? What is the recipe?"" (end)",Prabhupāda," There is an operator. A child cannot think. Motor car is running. Child will think the motor car is running automatically. But a sane man will understand that there is a driver. So persons who deny the existence of God are like that. They see the machine. Nature is the machine. But behind the machine there is an operator. These rascals cannot understand.Nābhijānāti,māmebhyaḥparamam, tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair.Machine is working, nature is working, that much they can see. And behind the machine there is operator. That they cannot see. What is your answer? What the atheist will say? Has the atheist any experience that any machine works without operator? Has he got any experience?"
Paramahaṁsa,No.,Prabhupāda, Then why does he say?
Paramahaṁsa,But this whole universe—we cannot compare the whole universe with any machine created by man.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Why you bring man? This machine is created and being operated by God."
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, we don't have any experience of such a machine.",Prabhupāda," Huh? What do you mean by machine. First of all define what is your idea of machine. Just like the other day we saw, we saw the Thompson place, being printed, being collected, and so many things are being done. It is like this. By machine the seasonal changes are going on, the sun is rising, the moon is rising, the water in the ocean, the waves are there. Everything, machine working. It is machine. Everything being systematically done. Such a big ocean, vast water, it is just on the brink, no more. It is so organized. The sun is rising exactly in time, astronomically. The astronomical watch is one ten-thousandth part of a second. It is so accurate. You'll find everything is going on. [break] Today isekādaśī,eleventh day of the moon, the moon shall be like this. There one can see the moon and he can calculate. ""Today isekādaśī."" This is not machine? It is exactly, machine."
Paramahaṁsa,But the thing is this machine is so wonderful that it goes on without an operator.,Prabhupāda," That is your dullness! You are rascal, you cannot understand how the machine is working, how big it is, that is your dullness. But it is a machine. Very big machine. You cannot understand—that is not (argument) that this is not a machine. This is not very good argument, that ""I cannot understand, therefore it is not a machine."" But you see the idea machine is there already, everything is going on—machine."
Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa,It is such a good machine it doesn't require an operator.; That is the wonder of it.,Prabhupāda," No. That is wrong. You cannot find out in your experience anywhere, any machine which is not being operated by a person. You cannot find it. Then why do you bring this idea that without operator it is going on. Where you get this idea? This is a false idea. Because you have no such experience. Where is the machine that ""Here is a machine going on without any operator."" Find out a machine."
Paramahaṁsa,We're trying. (laughter) There are some automatic machines.,Prabhupāda, Automatic is at the hand of the operator.
Śrutakīrti,Someone must turn it on and off.,Prabhupāda, Yes. There is no such automatic machine. It is impossible to prove.
Gaṇeśa,"But we can see the operator of these small machines, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we cannot see the operator of this big machine.",Prabhupāda, Have you seen the operator in the power house?
Gaṇeśa,No.,Prabhupāda, Then? Do you think the powerhouse is going on?
Paramahaṁsa,"Well we could see him. We could go, we could drive there right now and see him.",Prabhupāda," Yes, you can see. You can go toKṛṣṇaand see Him. That requires qualification."
Paramahaṁsa,That's not as easy.,Prabhupāda," No, it is very easy. It is simply, as we are teaching our students, just become a devotee, offernamaskār, man-manābhavamad-bhakto,always think of Him, and you will go to Him. It is not at all difficult.Bahavojñāna-tapasāpūtāmad-bhāvamāgatāḥ. Bahavo,many, did come to Me. How?Jñāna-tapasā,by knowledge andtapasya,being purified, they come to Me.Kṛṣṇasays. Why you are disappointed? You can go.Kṛṣṇais open.Te'piyāntiparāṁgatim.Striyaśūdratathāvaiśya,even the women, less intelligent, theśūdra,vaiśya,they can come. Where is the difficulty? Even if you are born very lowest, you can go.Kṛṣṇais open to everyone. Simply you become qualified. That's all. And what is the qualification?Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65],just always think of Me, become My devotee, offer your respects to Me, andman-manā,worship Me. Four things. That... We are opening this temple (in Melbourne) for this purpose, that you always think of Him, you worship Him, you offer obeisances to Him, and become His devotee. And then?Māmevaiṣyasiasaṁśayaḥ[Bg.18.65],without a doubt you will come to Him. What is the difficulty? There is no difficulty."
Paramahaṁsa,"If the operator of the powerhouse, he is operating and running the powerhouse, but it's not really necessary that we go and see him. We can simply enjoy the facilities offered by the powerhouse.",Prabhupāda," That's alright, but if you are intelligent enough, if you are a rascal fool, you cannot see, but if you are intelligent, then you'll be eager to: ""Who is operating? Let me see?"" That is the difference of intelligence. Dull, just like we read one story. One little boy he was beating on a drum. So, he became inquisitive, ""Wherefrom the sound is coming? Somebody must be within it."" He took a knife and cut it. This is intelligence. Wherefrom the sound is coming? He was beating-dum, dum, dum—he became inquisitive. That is intelligence. A dull student-coming, that's all. And intelligent, he tries to (find out), that is intelligence. Inquisitive. Intelligent boy will always enquire, ""What is this, father? What is this father? Wherefrom the sound is coming?"" That is intelligence. So, if one is very dull—just like cats and dogs, they cannot enquire. What is this machine? What is this behind? It is the human form of life—these enquiries should come. Otherwise he remains a cat and dog."
Jayadharma,"They say that they don't accept this body as a machine because they've never experienced a machine that can think, feel, and will for itself.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Paramahaṁsa,"Well they say that this body is more complicated than any other machine because it can think, feel, and will, whereas other machines don't do that.",Prabhupāda," But the thinking, feeling, the brain is there. If the... That is the particular machine, because the operator is within. That you cannot see. The thinking, feeling is coming from the operator. The soul is there,dehino 'sminyathadehe[Bg.2.13].That these rascals cannot understand, that the thinking, feeling, that is of the operator, not of the machine. Is that clear or not? The operator is within. So the thinking, feeling, as you were asking, that is not of the machine, but of the operator, the soul."
Gaṇeśa,"Just like the child, Śrīla Prabhupāda, who was trying to find the sound within the drum, the material scientists are trying to find out the cause and effect of the material world. Is that not intelligence?",Prabhupāda," Yes, but they have not reached the ultimate goal."
Paramahaṁsa,But they are trying.,Prabhupāda," They are trying. That is admitted. But, they are concluding that there is no operator. That is their foolishness, because they have failed to find out. They have to go further, further, and see, ""Yes, there is operator."" That is the final part of the... That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmām[Bg.7.19].So after many, many births of sincere inquiry, when he is actually intelligent, he will see, ""Oh,vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].Here isVasudeva.Heis everything."" That is stated. He'll enquire. Go on enquiring, life after life. And then he'll come to understandvāsudevaḥ-samahātmāsu-durlabhaḥ.You did not read this verse? They will come, after much trouble, much enquiry, they will come to the same conclusion,vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].But they'll waste time. That's all. When we say, ""Here is operator,"" they will not take. But they'll waste time, and life after life laboring, one day they will come."
Jayadharma,Does that mean that everybody is ultimately on the way back home? Back to Godhead?,Prabhupāda," Yes, everyone is enquiring, but according to his intelligence, perfection, he is making progress. Everyone. Everyone, because he is meant for that purpose. He has forgottenKṛṣṇa, andKṛṣṇais the reservoir of all pleasure. He is trying to find out pleasure other thanKṛṣṇa, therefore he is being baffled. Unless he comes toKṛṣṇathere is no pleasure. That he does not know."
Paramahaṁsa,We have a saying in the West that curiosity killed the cat.,Prabhupāda," Another example as I gave, crying children, child, crying, crying, crying, crying. As soon as he is on the lap of his mother, immediately stops. Why? He can understand, ""Now I have got the real thing."" Other woman taking, he still continues crying. You have seen it? This is practical. But when the child comes to the lap of his own mother, he immediately stops. Mother also takes care, ""My dear child, come."" He sucks the breast and is satisfied."
Gaṇeśa,"So one day the material scientist after many, many births will come to understandVasudevaorKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Gaṇeśa,They will become devotees.,Prabhupāda," But that is their foolishness. We, people,Kṛṣṇaconscious people say, ""Here is your ultimate goal of this science. Take it."" That they will not take. That is foolishness. They will come to the same point. But when you offer him, he will not take. That is less intelligent. [break]"
Paramahaṁsa,You were saying that inquisitiveness is the...,Prabhupāda," That is human life. That inquisitiveness cannot be found in cats and dogs. That is the difference between cats and dogs and human being. Human being, unless he becomes inquisitive for what is the ultimate source, he is not human being. All these people, 99.9 per cent people, they are not inquisitive. They are searching after some happiness, but they are not inquisitive what is the source of happiness. They are being baffled in the material world. They have, for happiness they have discovered this horseless carriage and so many things, but there is so much unhappiness also when the motor car is crashed between two and life is lost. They are not inquisitive that we have invented this machine for happiness, why this disaster? That intelligence is not. That is it. They are simply going on searching after, but when we say, ""No, not in this way, come this way and you'll get happiness,"" They'll not. That is (inaudible)."
Paramahaṁsa,"But if a person becomes too much inquisitive, just like with the boy and themṛdaṅga,due to his inquisitiveness he ruined themṛdaṅga,and then he doesn't have any drum.",Prabhupāda," That's alright. The drum can be purchased again, but he should be given credit because he is inquisitive. You can purchase another drum, it doesn't matter, but he gets the credit because he is inquisitive."
Gaṇeśa,"What about the scientists, Śrīla Prabhupāda? They are very inquisitive, they are trying to find out the cause of the material world.",Prabhupāda," That credit we give them. Just like this child. But the childishness is this, that when they are given correct information, they do not take it. (indistinct) If we say to the material scientists that ""You are searching after this, here it is,Kṛṣṇa,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavo[Bg.10.8],I am the original source of everything."" they will not accept. That is their foolishness."
Gaṇeśa,"They are very inquisitive, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," That credit is already given, but you are inquisitive for a certain thing, if the thing is offered, if you do not accept then you become foolish.Bahūnāṁjanmanāmante[Bg.7.19],Vāsudeva,he'll come to that point, thatKṛṣṇais everything, but when you inform him before that here is the thing, he will not take. That is the foolishness."
Paramahaṁsa,"You were saying everyone is inquisitive for happiness, but shouldn't that be purified? Shouldn't we give up all desire for happiness?",Prabhupāda," No, no. Happiness is life. How you can give up?"
Paramahaṁsa,"But if we desire for happiness, then we are being selfish.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but you do not know where you is your self... [break] ...sense. That is your foolishness.Nateviduḥsvārtha-gatiṁhiviṣṇum[SB7.5.31],they do not know. Everyone is selfish, everyone is self-interested. But he does not know how to fulfill it. That is foolishness."
Paramahaṁsa,But isn't it better to give up all ego altogether?,Prabhupāda," Why? Why? That isMāyāvādīphilosophy. We make our ego purified. ""I am servant ofKṛṣṇa."" That is wanted. Not that to make my egoism zero. That isMāyāvāda.They are disappointed, they think finish this egoism. It cannot be finished. Because you are individual soul, it cannot be finished. Simply it has to be purified. I am thinking Indian, you are thinking American. You are neither American neither Indian. We are all part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa. Direct we have to come to that point. Not to falsely think that I am American, I am Indian, I am cat, I am dog. That has to be finished. But you'll come to the real egoism, that I am eternal servant ofKṛṣṇa. That ""I am"" will go on. No that... They are thinking in a way to finish the ""I am"" or ""I am the same."" Wrong thing."
Gaṇeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, the material scientists are so inquisitive, yet they are leading lives like cats and dogs, how can they come to...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, because they are wrongly directed. You are inquiring me, ""Sir I want to such and such place."" If that place is this way, if I say you gothisway. You go this way. Then you'll be baffled, and you'll be unhappy. Wrong direction."
Paramahaṁsa,But we are taking some direction from...,Prabhupāda," That's alright, but if you take wrong direction you'll be unhappy. Your destination will not be (reached)."
Gaṇeśa,So how can the scientists arrive atvāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19]?,Prabhupāda," For that he has to take direction fromKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays the destination Himself. He comes and says, ""Here is, I am the destination, come here."" But if you don't take, that is your misfortune. The direction is here. The perfect director is there, but he's unfortunate—he does not accept this. Therefore he is baffled. We are... Our propaganda is therefore, that you rascals, all blind leaders, rascals, don't try to lead. Take Kṛṣṇa's instruction and lead. Then you'll be perfect. This is our propaganda. Leading must be there, direction must be there, but the direction and leading must be perfect, then (indistinct). Or enquiries must be there but if the answers or the leading is bad, then you have to (indistinct). So we should make our enquiry toKṛṣṇa, and take His direction."
Paramahaṁsa,"But some people say that theBhagavad-gītāis the direction, and some people say that theKoranis the direction, some people...",Prabhupāda," Some people. Many authorities say it is right, and that is your fortune or misfortune. As some people say that it is written by some man or something, then it is not perfect. There are many others also, they say it is perfect. Now it is your choice, whom you to follow. So that some people as they are against, there are for also. Now it is up to you to accept whom. It is up to you. We accept the direction of theācāryas,Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya,Caitanya. Their word is perfect. They take the direction ofGandhior this man, that man. Both of them are taking direction, but when the direction is perfect, then you become perfect. If the direction is imperfect, you remain imperfect. That's all."
Gaṇeśa,We can see from the results of those different directions.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Results,phalena-paricīyate.That is required. Now there are so manyGandhi-itestudents. They have also readBhagavad-gītā,and you have also readBhagavad-gītā.Find out the difference. That is the result."
Paramahaṁsa,We have heard thatGandhiwas a greatmahātmā.,Prabhupāda, You have heard. You have heard so many things. That mountain gave birth to a mouse. You have heard like that.
Paramahaṁsa,"ButGandhialso read theBhagavad-gītā,and he made so many wonderful comments on theGītā.",Prabhupāda," That wonderfulness is for the rascals and the fools. What wonderful he has done? He preached nonviolence, but he was killed by violence. That is his wonderful example. He preached the philosophy of nonviolence, which is impossible. ThereforeKṛṣṇakilled him by violence. This is his wonderful. And his foolishness was proved, that there cannot be nonviolence. So he was a fool."
Paramahaṁsa,But he himself was nonviolent.,Prabhupāda," Nonviol... That's alright, he was a fool. Therefore I say you cannot bring nonviolence in politics. There is no such history. Just likeArjunawanted to be nonviolent.Kṛṣṇachastized him, that you are a foolish number one. So... This is to bring a horse before a cart. Politics and nonviolence, it is incompatible. It is not possible. And he did it. Therefore he was a fool. Just like if you want to cook without fire. Is it possible?"
Devotee,No.,Prabhupāda," So, this is foolishness. You become very bold enough, ""Now I shall cook without fire."" You are a rascal number one.Gandhidid it. Actually he could not drive away the Britishers by nonviolence, for thirty years, thirty-five years he struggled. When Subash Bose introduced violence, they were forced out. This is politics. Politics and nonviolence (incompatible). There is no history in the world that politics has been successful without violence, and he introduced this. So how much foolish he was, you can understand. It is same thing like that, if somebody says, ""I'll cook without any. I shall scientifically do that a man can give birth to a child."" There is no history, and if I say, ""Now I shall do it. I shall see that equal rights. As a woman is giving birth to a child, the man will also will give child."" These things are foolishness. This is not intelligence. The women are claiming equal rights. So, stop giving birth to a child? Then equal rights. Can it be possible? The man and woman unite, but the woman becomes pregnant, not the man. And if somebody says, now the man will become pregnant, is it not foolishness?"
Paramahaṁsa,"But they have made a way so that the women also don't have to become pregnant. This contraceptive, and...",Prabhupāda, This is another foolishness. (indistinct) another... [break] This unnatural thing. [break] What is this insignia?
Śrutakīrti,That is Ford's insignia.,Prabhupāda, Ford? This is Ford?
Śrutakīrti; Gaṇeśa; Gaṇeśa,"This is a Ford?; LTD.; Does it mean we should use violence to spreadKṛṣṇaconsciousness then, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," No. Yes, when there is politics, that is necessary. I am speaking of politics, not of love. You cannot create love by violence. That is another thing. But if you want kingdom, there must be violence. By violence you cannot force a woman, agree to love you. That is not possible. Then there must be love. The business must be done accordingly. But when there is politics, there must be violence. Otherwise you cannot come out victorious. [break] ...in a friendly way. ""Might is right."" SoGandhidid this foolishness and he died of violence. (laughs) He praised the philosophy of nonviolence, but he was himself killed by violence. That was his foolishness."
Paramahaṁsa,"But we have seen LordBuddha, he conquered all of India withahiṁsā,nonviolence, LordBuddha.",Prabhupāda, LordBuddhawas not a politician.
Paramahaṁsa,But he conquered India. He became the most...,Prabhupāda," That is another thing. He conquered India. If he con-quered India, why he is driven out of India? Nobody is Buddhist now in India. And inJapan, nearly also halfway, so that is (indistinct). Buddha's nonviolence and Gandhi's nonviolence is different."
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Gandhi's nonviolence all rascaldom because he was dealing in politics.Buddhanever entered in politics. So how you can compare withBuddha? His activities are different. His activity of false vibration(?), to stop all kinds of miseries of material world. That was his philosophy. He never dealt in politics. Although he was a king's son, he never dealt in politics. You cannot... This is foolishness. We do not know. We do not study what is Buddha's position, what is Gandhi's position."
Paramahaṁsa,"But still, everyone in India respectsGandhiso much. They have statues and everything.",Prabhupāda," That is another thing. He was a good gentleman. He was very humble, meek. Because you have got some fault, that does not mean you have no qualities. That is another thing. But if you deal wrongly with something, then you must be called a foolish man. You may have very good qualities, but if you do not know how to deal with business, then you are foolish. He was mainly engaged in politics, but he did not know how to deal with politics. He was readingBhagavad-gītāand he was misleading people that in theBhagavad-gītāthere is nonviolence. Just see. BecauseArjunawanted to become nonviolent the wholeBhagavad-gītāwas taught to him, how to become violent, and this rascal said that in theBhagavad-gītāthere is nonviolence. It is not false? So a man preaching falsehood, is he a gentleman? Or he is a right man?"
Paramahaṁsa,No.,Prabhupāda," So that is his position. Either he is a foolish rascal or he is not a gentleman, falsely preachingBhagavad-gītā.That is his position. If you do not know a subject matter, why do you talk about it? Either you mislead or cheat or you are a foolish, you have no science. Similarly, here is a tape recorder, I do not know how the machine is working. If I talk about it authoritatively is it not my foolishness? I can talk aboutBhagavad-gītāor something else, but that does mean I know everything about this machine? But he did it like this. He was dealing in politics, and he took up as amahātmā,a religious man. That was his cheating."
Paramahaṁsa,"So because people are so much in darkness about religion, therefore they say...",Prabhupāda," Yes, everyone is in darkness. If you can make propaganda, the people will be misled. That is not very difficult. Just like from Russia, nobody is communist. But it is going on—the Russia is communist country. I have studied thoroughly. Nobody is communist. Maybe a few only. But it is going on by propaganda that Russia is a communist country. The people in general, they are forced to accept it. That book was written by some man, terrorism. It is terrorism. That's it. By force. Nobody accepts this communist philosophy, I have studied. (everyone gets out of car) They were very, very unhappy. The young man cannot go out of the country. Just see. Restricted. How much uncomfortable he is feeling. Especially in European countries, the young men, they want to go. But they will not allow. They will not allow anything to read except Lenin's literature. What is this? Simply suppressing. Everyone is unhappy. Which way? This way? This is their position. I have seen it directly. And as soon as one is suspected that he is doing otherwise, he will be sent to some unknown camp. Nobody knows where he has gone."
Paramahaṁsa,"Just like they had some people who came to Russia to start some Buddhist thing, and then they were sent away to some camp, concentration camp.",Prabhupāda, Never seen again.
Paramahaṁsa,No one has seen them.,Prabhupāda, Just see. This is their... It is the most fallen country. No freedom. No freedom at all. Horrible country.
Gaṇeśa,Why don't the people revolt if they're so unhappy?,Prabhupāda," Yes, they are revolting, but they are now so much suppressed they cannot... Sometimes there is revolt. Sometimes there is upheaval."
Paramahaṁsa,"Not a big upheaval because they are terrorized. They are afraid that if they revolt, then they...",Prabhupāda, They will be killed.
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah, the government will come out and just shoot them all.",Prabhupāda," Yes, all the Leninists and Stalinists, they kill. It is a country of terrorism. That's all. The government men, they are simply terrorists. That's all."
Paramahaṁsa,"Just like in Cambodia they just, the new Communist government, they executed tens and thousands of people just recently.",Prabhupāda, Just see.
Paramahaṁsa,People who were working for the old government. They just killed them all. So this what the people are afraid of.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Terrorism. This Communism means terrorism. (aside:) Thank you.
Amogha,"I have a garland, but it's not finished. Almost...",Prabhupāda," Communism means terrorism. That I have seen. I have studied personally. By threat, by pressure, that's all. Nobody is communist in Russia."
Jayadharma,"Is the whole world going to become Communist, Prabhupāda? Or is the whole world going to becomeKṛṣṇacons...",Prabhupāda," Nobody is Communist, but if the demons are powerful, they will declare."
Paramahaṁsa,They will introduce it.,Prabhupāda," They will not introduce; they will declare like that, falsely. That's all."
Paramahaṁsa,"Even in some countries where Communism has a very light influence, like in Thailand there's a little bit of Communist influence, when they had a student revolt, the government came in with tanks and machine guns and immediately killed about three thousand students.",Prabhupāda, In Thailand?
Paramahaṁsa,Yes. In Bangkok. That was about two years ago.,Prabhupāda," Oh, just see."
Paramahaṁsa,"So the people are very afraid to cause any upheaval. They are afraid that immediately the government will just come and kill them. 'Cause the government has all the weapons. They have the tanks and the guns and everything. And the normal people, they don't have any weapons.",Prabhupāda," This is the age ofKali-yuga. Therefore the only shelter isKṛṣṇa. There is no other way. In India it's practically dwindling. Now there is no reason they are not sanctioning our temple. They do not give any reason. ""No!"" Why ""No""? ""We don't give any reason."" And""Kīrtanais nuisance, nuisance."" They are doing that already."
Śrutakīrti,Śrīla Prabhupāda? For breakfast just fruits?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śrutakīrti,Milk?,Prabhupāda," No. You can... Cashew and ginger. And you make, what is called,channa.In the lunch make cheese. Cheese, cheese. Fry it, and make preparation."
Śrutakīrti,Tomato and cheese?,Prabhupāda," Tomato, cheese, potato. Yes. And fried peanuts? And salad, fruit. By force... Communism is going on, by force. It is the result of sinful life."
Paramahaṁsa,They're put into that circumstance.,Prabhupāda," Yes, people are sinful, they will not do nicely, and now, by nature... Just like this child killing. They did it in his previous life. Now he is suffering. He will be killed. The nature's reaction. We are taking sympathy with the child who is being killed, but we do not know that he did the same business. Now he is being killed. That is nature's law."
Paramahaṁsa,"The person who doesn't know, he thinks that the child is innocent...",Prabhupāda," Innocent child. He's not innocent. He is sinful. He is being, what is called, chastised.Svakarma-phala-rūpa-jīva.That is the word,svakarma.One suffers... (aside:) You can sit down here, just like... Everyone suffers the reaction of his own work.Svakarma-phala-rūpa-jīva.Because he is a child, he takes sympathy, ""Oh, such a small child is being killed."" We take it like that. It is that he is the potent criminal. Now he is being punished."
Paramahaṁsa,You were saying with all these wars. The people that are being killed are simply...,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore those who are in high standard, they do not take anything as wrong. Everyone is suffering his own reaction. Thenbhaktas,they think,tatte'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁvipākam[SB10.14.8].When a devotee is in trouble, he thinks that ""I am suffering for my past deeds. [break] ...me."" That is a devotee's attitude. ""Let me do my business, chantHareKṛṣṇa."" And then he is sure. Such person is assured to come back. He doesn't care for all this suffering. He thinks, ""I am suffering for my past deeds. That's all. Why shall I bother myself? Let me do my present duty,HareKṛṣṇa,HareKṛṣṇa."" That is the first-class position. He is assured. In spite of all material difficulties, if he goes on with chanting, then his chance is first. That is stated.Dāya-bhāk.Dāya-bhākmeans he inherits God's property as the son's inherits the father's property.Dāya-bhāk.So we should be callous with all these political, social... We should simply go on. That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu. He was callous. Family affairs, wife's responsibility, for mother's responsibility for... Nothing. Simply chantHareKṛṣṇa.Kīrtanīyaḥsadāhariḥ[Cc. Ādi17.31].That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu's life. Even didn't care for anything, no responsibility. ""My only business is chanting."" That is... You preach for some time. Then you simply engage in chanting. Preaching means to make him strong, preaching, to become firmly convinced inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is preaching. So when he is firmly convinced, then he can give up preaching and sit down and simply chant. Not in the beginning. That is imitation. He must be firmly convinced. So we have to studyCaitanyaMahāprabhu's life. Except—this is the clear and simple truth—except chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra,there is no other business of the human being. So this preaching is also chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra.This is preaching. That has been shown by all the disciples ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. All the Gosvāmīs,HaridāsaṬhākura and others, only did that, how to developKṛṣṇaconsciousness, no other business. That issannyāsa.He has no other business. To preachKṛṣṇaconsciousness, to practiceKṛṣṇaconsciousness, to convinceKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that's all, no other business. We don't take part in politics, sociology, and mental speculation, ""science,"" or so on, so on, all nonsense. We reject, all kicked out. That is the perfection. It is simply waste of time. These are all superficial. Just like waves in the sea. Where is the meaning? The waves are going on. Oh, very nice. You collected all these flowers?"
Amogha,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Great service.
Amogha,From the public gardens. There is a big public garden.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Amogha,The government plants for the city to look nice.,Prabhupāda, But you are stealing.
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"No, not from anyone's house.; From the government.",Prabhupāda," Very, very nice flowers. Such a bigroseI have never seen."
Paramahaṁsa,In India they don't grow that big. They are very small.,Prabhupāda," Nobody takes care. The man also grows very small. There is no food, there is no soil. Poverty lives.Daridra-doṣaguṇa-nāśe,when a person becomes poverty-stricken, all his quality goes away. He might have very good qualification but if... [break] Unfortunately, being misguided, this position of opulence, they are misusing it, and therefore becoming hippies. Simply misusing it. Instead of utilizing the position for development ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, they are misusing it. So timely the movement has come to your country. Just try to apply in your practical life, preach all over the world, at least all over your own country. Here also, the Australians, they have got opulence. Try to relieve them. You are American or Australian?"
Jayadharma; Paramahaṁsa,"I'm an Australian, Prabhupāda.; Australian, he says.",Prabhupāda," Australian, that's nice. Learn this art and preach. There is good potency in your country. You are also not poverty.Kṛṣṇasays,imaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ[Bg.4.2].Rājarṣimeans very rich, kings. He never said, ""All thebungeesunderstood it. All the wretched class understood it."" He never taught. It is meant for the leaders of the society, opulent kings and leaders. It is meant for them. Poverty-stricken man cannot under... But there is no bar, there is no hindrance. But this is especially meant for the opulent person. Otherwise whyKṛṣṇasaysimaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ?And He instructed first to the sun-god. He is not ordinary person. He instructed later on toArjuna. He is not ordinary person. Because one important person learns the science, he will preach it all over the earth.CaitanyaMahāprabhuhas directly said they are not ordinary persons. So unless one is materially not ordinary, he cannot preach. All the Gosvāmīs, they were coming from respectable... And whereGauḍīyaMaṭhacame? These are third-class men, no position in their past life."
Paramahaṁsa,Most of them just came from the villages.,Prabhupāda," That's all. Uneducated, half-educated, poor, poverty-stricken. They could not do anything. Some of our Godbrothers I have beat them. (LikeTīrtha) (indistinct). In his previous life he had a big, big business organization. So therefore he has been able to organize. They will admit. They are coming from some third-class status of life. This is not tripe, this is fact."
Paramahaṁsa,"Actually, I noticed that myself so many times in the way you handle money and the managerial affairs, very expert.",Prabhupāda," Yes,CaitanyaMahāprabhu's...Śrī-caitanya-mano'bhīṣṭaṁsthāpitaṁyenabhū-tale,svayaṁrūpagosvāmī.Who established the mission ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu?RūpaGosvāmī. He was minister. He was not a cultivator, plow department."
Paramahaṁsa,It's very difficult inKali-yugato get the advanced materialists such as ministers and big businessmen...,Prabhupāda," You can convert. It is not difficulty. How theRūpaGosvāmī was converted? Because the expert man... That person was ŚrīCaitanyaMahāprabhu. So if you become expert, you can convert. How this governor was coming, how these politicians were coming?"
Paramahaṁsa,Because you're the expert.,Prabhupāda," It is not just we. You have to become expert to convert another expert. If you are not experienced, how you can convert others?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Is it true that you will end up converting people according to your own..., in other words, you convert people of your own caliber?",Prabhupāda," Not own caliber, any caliber. That requires expert management."
Paramahaṁsa,"But if you become high quality or high class, then automatically you attract that type of person.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That you can do. You American people, you can do. That I am instructing. You can do. And actually, because some of you will cooperate the movement is going on. Therefore I came to America. When I found that in India no intelligent boys were coming, then I decided, ""Let me go to America."""
Paramahaṁsa,"Still, even after you went to America and brought back so many European and American disciples, still the Indians are so slow to come and join.",Prabhupāda," Because they have been... The disease is very chronic. They are not opulent. That diagnosis already given. They have become poverty-stricken. Sodaridra-doṣaguṇanaśe.Although they are born in India, they have got many qualification, due to this poverty-stricken position, they... Their first business is how to... Because they have got family attachment, so they cannot sacrifice. They will work very, very hard. You have seen how they are going to office, how..., because they have got the responsibility of family. That is Indians another feature. They take family responsibility. In your country there is no such thing. There is no family. There is no family responsibility. In India still that old tradition is going on. Therefore they cannot sacrifice the family responsibility, although they are willing. And the whole thing is it is due to poverty-stricken position. They have got family responsibilities. They think, ""If I go, then whole family will starve. How can I go?"" That is the exact position. And to come to that stage, that ""Let my family starve, I don't mind,"" that is very higher stage. That issarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66],""Oh, no responsibility, simply I have got respons..."" That is not ordinary stage. You cannot expect these things from ordinary man."
Jayadharma,"A person may see somebody do that, may think that they're irresponsible.",Prabhupāda," Yes, escaping, so many accusations. But with all these accusations one can do that. There is no harm. But that position is not for all."
Paramahaṁsa,"Due to that poverty-stricken condition, if someone does come to us, they usually want to get something from us.",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Yes. You find out this verse,tyaktvāsva-dharmaṁcaraṇāmbujaṁharer[SB1.5.17].Find out first the index."
Paramahaṁsa,First Canto. Yellow. Yellow.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Here, here. Find out this verse:tyaktvāsva-dharmaṁcaraṇāmbujaṁharerbhajann apakvo 'thapatettatoyadi,yatrakvavābhadram abhūdamuṣyakiṁ..."
Amogha,,Prabhupāda," That's it. They are thinking, ""I am doing my duty,"" but they do not gain anything. And a person doesn't care for any responsibility; he comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. He gains something. Even if he falls down in immature stage, he gains something. But other man, he is doing his duty very nicely, but he is gaining nothing. You should read the purport."
Paramahaṁsa,"""As far as the duties of mankind are concerned, there are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound not only to his parents, family members, society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods, etc., but also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists, etc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentiment, and in the long run, due to so many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable association. There are so many instances of this in the histories.BharataMahārājawas obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in the next birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incidents of his previous birth. Similarly,Citraketualso fell down due to his offenses at the feet of Śiva. But in spite of all this, the stress is given here to surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord, even if there is a chance of falling down, because even though one falls down from the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will never forget the lotus feet of the Lord. Once engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, one will continue the service in all circumstances. In theBhagavad-gītāit is said that even a small quantity of devotional service can save one from the most dangerous position. There are many instances of such examples in history.Ajāmilais one of them.Ajāmilain his early life was a devotee, but in his youth he fell down. Still, he was saved by the Lord at the end.""",Prabhupāda," Even by sentiment one comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he is not loser; he is gainer. And if one person does not come toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he does his duty very nicely, he gains nothing."
Paramahaṁsa,"Due to the so many rascal commenters on theBhagavad-gītā,in India all the Indians have a conception that the perfection of human life is to simply execute one'skarmaor to do his duty to his family, etc, and therefore they're wasting their time in this way and completely neglecting devotional service.HareKṛṣṇa. [break]",Prabhupāda, You bring so many varieties of food: And my duty is to eat.
Paramahaṁsa,Yes. So...,Prabhupāda, So now let me perform my duty. (end)
Kim; Amogha; Kim; Amogha; Kim; Amogha,"Yes.; He was telling me that the paper he's writing for his master's degree is comparing a German philosopher with Buddhist philosophy.; Which, as far as I can gather, the self/no-self thing, Buddhism was denying that you're theātman,I think. Could you perhaps say something about that?; He's asking about the conception of denial of the self.; Of theātman,yes.; Ātman.The finishing ofātman.",Prabhupāda, Hmm. So how can you denyātman?
Kim,"InHinduphilosophy, what is the nature of theātman?",Prabhupāda," Nature ofātmanis eternal. Eternity, knowledge and blissfulness.Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt:(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12)ātmāis joy,ānanda,blissful."
Kim,I've read some of theUpaniṣadswhere they say thatātmanisBrahman?,Prabhupāda, Why have I placed this flower here? Why do I like this flower? What is the reason?
Kim,"Because it's beautiful, perhaps?",Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore you want to enjoy. This is the nature ofātmā.I want to enjoy. This is blissfulness. Then, why are you trying to become a philosopher?"
Kim,For understanding.,Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore knowledge. Why do you not like to die? Because you are eternal. Thereforeātmā'snature is eternal, full of knowledge, and full of bliss. This is knowledge.Satcitānanda.Do you know Sanskrit?"
Kim,"No, but some words.",Prabhupāda," That isātmā'snature.Satcitānanda.Eternal, full of knowledge, and blissful."
Kim,"A question. Is there, is it theātman...",Prabhupāda, Just hear.
Kim,Ātmanis attached to each person?,Prabhupāda, Just hear.
Amogha; Kim,"He says hear for a moment.; I'm listening, of course.",Prabhupāda," Ātmā'snature. One question should be understood, thoroughly. You have asked what is the nature ofātmā.Theātmā'snature is that he is eternal. He never dies. Never takes birth. He is already existing. Just like, you were a child, you were a baby. The body is no longer existing. Your childhood body is no longer existing, but you know that you were a child. You remember your childhood days. Therefore, you are different from the body. The body is passed away, but you remember that you had a body like that. Therefore you exist. You know that you'll become an old man. So this body will not exist. Another body you will get, old age body. Therefore you will exist; the body will change. Now try to understand this fact first of all, and if you cannot understand, ask questions."
Kim,"Theātman,there is one to a person, or there is only oneātman?",Prabhupāda," You areātmā,I amātmā,we are not one. You are individual, I am individual. I don't agree with you, you don't agree with me. So how one?"
Kim,I beg your pardon?,Prabhupāda, How it is one?
Amogha; Kim,"He says that you are individual and he is individual, so how can they be one?; How can they be one? I see. Yes. I was wondering how theātmanis associated with each individual. Is it the... Isn't it right to say the personistheātman?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Kim,The person is theātman.And to each person there is oneātmanassociated.,Prabhupāda, You are a person and I am a person. You are changing bodies and I am changing bodies.
Kim,And through all the changes there is theātmanthat continues.,Prabhupāda," Who is here first of all? You are a person. I am a person. You are hearing, I am speaking. We are two persons. So why you say one?"
Kim,Two bodies.,Prabhupāda," Yes, two bodies, just like two dresses. You are differently dressed, I am differently dressed, but that does not mean that we are one. We are one asātmā.Just like you are Australian, I am Indian, but as human being we are one. But as Australian, as Indian, we are different. Therefore we are one and different at the same time."
Kim,Is theātman...,Prabhupāda, Ātmāas spirit soul is one.
Kim,Is one.,Prabhupāda, But as individual soul they are different.
Kim,"And theātmanis just with respect to consciousness, or can we talk about...",Prabhupāda, No.
Kim,...anātmanwithout consciousness.,Prabhupāda," Consciousness is the symptom ofātmā.Because theātmāis within your body, therefore your consciousness is there. Now, because theātmāis within the body, if I pinch or if you pinch my body, I feel pains and pleasures. As soon as theātmāis not there, it will be cut with a chopper, there is no protest. So, thatātmāis present within this body, that is understood by the presence of consciousness. Just like we are here in this room, but this light is the reflection of the sunshine. We understand there is sun in the sky. The light and heat we are feeling, that means the sun is in the sky. Similarly, our consciousness and knowledge, etc., are there, that means that theātmāis there. The sameātmā,when it will go out of this body, there will be no more consciousness, no more knowledge, no more feelings of pains and pleasures."
Kim,Can one say what qualities theātmanhas?,Prabhupāda," That I have already explained. Eternity, knowledge and blissfulness."
Kim,And doesHinduphilosophy say anything about...,Prabhupāda," Don't talkHinduphilosophy, talk of philosophy."
Kim,Philosophy. How theātmancame into being?,Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Kim,How did theātmancome into being?,Prabhupāda," Ātmāis not coming into being, it is already there. But at the present moment it is accepting different types of bodies. Just like your this dress is available in the market. And you are also there, so you purchase the dress and put on. Similarly, the different types of bodies are already there. You according to your desire accept one type of body, and you appear in that body. There are 8,400,000 different forms of body, and you have to accept one of them. According to desire. According to your work. You are working. Everyone is working. Now, according to the work and association, he is creating his body. Just like if you infect some type of disease, then you'll have to accept that disease. So we are working ways—we are individuals—and according to that work we are creating our next body. If you are working in a godly way, then you'll get your body next as god, and if you are working in a dogly way, then you'll get your body as dog. So, by nature's way, evolution, we come through 800 millions of forms of life, then nature gives us a chance to accept this human form of body. In this body, our consciousness being advanced, if we try we can understand what is the problem of life, why we have accepted birth, death, old age and disease, how to get out of these, how to revive our original nature of body and again become eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. This is the chance of the human body. Therefore you are a philosopher because you are in the human body, but a dog cannot be a philosopher. He may be a very big dog, can bark very loudly, he has got very good strength, can create big disturbance, but he cannot understand philosophy. That is not possible. But a human being can understand. Therefore he should be given chance to understand the philosophy of life. And that isVedas."
Kim,That is?,Prabhupāda, Vedas.
Kim,"Oh,Vedas,yes.",Prabhupāda," TheVedasare there for understanding by the human society. And if he lives like a cat and dog, then he spoils his life. We should take advantage of the Vedic knowledge and make our life successful. This is real philosophy."
Kim,"I'm not very familiar with theHinduscriptures, but I have read someUpaniṣads,and there's the idea that somehowātmanisBrahman? I don't understand that at all, so perhaps you could say something about that?",Prabhupāda, WhichUpaniṣadare you reading?
Kim,"I've read theChāndogya,the—I don't know the pronunciations.",Prabhupāda, There are one hundred and eightUpaniṣads.
Kim,"I don't know the pronunciations, that's the difficulty.",Prabhupāda, Have you readĪśopaniṣad?
Kim,Pardon?,Prabhupāda, Īśopaniṣad.
Kim,"I'm familiar with the name, but that's about all.",Prabhupāda, Give himĪśopaniṣad.Read from the beginning. Have you read this book? This is the firstUpaniṣadthat is read. Can you read Sanskrit?
Kim,No.,Prabhupāda, Transliteration?
Amogha; Kim,You just read the sound.; ,Prabhupāda, Read the translation.
Kim,"""The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.""",Prabhupāda, Now read the purport. After reading the translation do you understand everything?
Kim,"No. (reads purport to) ""...andParamātmāor Supersoul realization is the realization of Hissatandcitfeatures."" I don't understand that. I read the words, but...",Prabhupāda," It requires elucidation. ""Complete whole"" means, just like your body is complete whole, and there are so many other things, there are so many holes in the body, there are so many hairs on the body, there are so many hairs on the head, so many fingers, eyes, ears—so many things—but the body is a complete unit, working as a complete machine. And there are so many things. Similarly, the whole cosmos is complete, exactly like this body is a machine. Similarly the whole cosmos is a big machine. It is complete. One sun is there and keeping everything complete. The day and night, the seasonal changes, the equator, the temperature, the moonlight, the other planets, we living beings, the vegetables—everything is complete by God. And because the sun is there. Similarly, this body, machine, is complete. And the soul is there, it is working nicely. The body is also a creation, and the universe is also a creation, and the brain which has created these things, He is complete. Therefore He has created these complete units. That is the idea.Pūrṇamidaṁ[IsoInvocation].Pūrṇaḥmeans complete. And because He is complete, the Creator, He has no defect; therefore He can create everything complete.Pūrṇamidaṁ,pūrṇamadaḥ,pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate.And He is so complete thatpūrṇasyapūrṇamādāya,from the complete, if you take the whole complete, still He is complete. Here is a glass of water; I am drinking. Drinking part by part. And when it is finished, the water is finished, no more complete. But He is so complete, that just like the sun, the temperature is being distributed for million and millions of years, still it is full of temperature. Here, unless the electric power is there, it is not complete. But there is power in the sunshine. It is a reservoir of so much temperature and light, that in history millions and millions of years it is distributing, the seasonal changes are going on, the green foliage is coming again, the snow and rain is coming, so many things are going on account of temperature. Any machine is rolling, just like as soon as there is power the machine is rolling. In all machines, your bodily machine, my bodily machine, and electric machines and other powered machines—everything is going on.Pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate.And in spite of taking so much energy from the sun, it is still full of light and energy. This is one of the creations of the Supreme. Now how much perfect is the Supreme? Its one of the creations, sun, is maintaining the whole universe. And there are many millions of universes, and each of them has got a sun to conduct the business. And all these suns are created by somebody. How much complete He is? You can just imagine. That is God. God is not such a cheap thing. People become God, ""I am God."" You are a nonsense rascal. What you can do? These are bluff. They do not know what is God. Here is God—complete.Pūrṇamadaḥ,pūrṇamidaṁ[Īśopaniṣad,Invocation].The whole creation is complete, still He is complete. The energy is coming from here, still He is complete. This energy also. A glass of water, I throw the glass, and water again is coming. Again I throw, again it is coming. Incessantly coming, all the energies. This is the idea of God.Pūrṇamidaṁ[IsoInvocation],pūrṇamadaḥ,pūrṇamidaṁ,pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate,pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāya,pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate.One minus one equals one, not zero. One plus one equals one, not two. This is complete. This is the idea of God. Just like the ocean. You take many thousands of buckets of water out, still it is complete. And again you put many buckets, thousands, millions of buckets of water, it is the same depth. This is another example. Material example. This is complete. You take millions of buckets of water from the ocean, you'll find not a drop is lost. And you put millions of buckets of water again, not a drop is increased.Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate.If you try to take out the whole ocean, still it will remain the ocean. This is the idea of complete."
Kim,One more question. What do you think of the use of drugs as an aid?,Prabhupāda," Drugs? That is another side of madness. Just like, human being, after the evolution of 8 million forms of bodies, he comes to human body to understand philosophy, theseVedas.So instead of utilizing life for that purpose, he wants to become again like the cats and dogs, and therefore he takes drugs. He is already cat and dog. He's no better than cats and dogs, because he has no interest in this knowledge. He was meant for this knowledge but he remains like cats and dogs, therefore he is not satisfied, therefore he takes drugs to forget himself. This is the philosophy of drugs. He was meant for becoming satisfied by taking this knowledge. He does not get the chance. Nobody leads him to this knowledge. He remains like cats and dogs, but as a human being if he lives like cats and dogs, he'll never be happy. Because there is no happiness, therefore he takes drugs, to forget. This is the drug philosophy. Drug philosophy means to forget one's present suffering. He must suffer, because his consciousness is developed. He must take this Vedic knowledge, but he does not take. Therefore he is dissatisfied, and to counteract the dissatisfaction he takes drugs. This is drug philosophy."
Kim,"Perhaps often it is that, but...",Prabhupāda, Not perhaps. There is no question of perhaps. We want to speak factually.
Kim,"But Patañjali says thatsiddhis,powers, can be produced by drugs, so perhaps...",Prabhupāda," Drugs are meant for medicinal purposes, not for drinking or taking generally. Every herb, every vegetable, is a drug meant for curing a particular disease. This is nature's gift. Just like if you cut your finger, you take little grass and take a little juice and apply it. It will act as tincturizing, immediately. They are meant for this purpose. These vegetable, drugs, are meant for when you are sick or disturbed, you can utilize. Not for intoxication. Just like opium. If you have severe type of dysentery, diarrhea, a little opium it will immediately cure. But opium is not meant for using as an intoxication. There is use of opium. Morphia, opium, they have got use at a certain time, not for using it for intoxication. That is foolish."
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, can drugs sometimes be used to help us for spiritual realization?",Prabhupāda," No. That is nonsense. Spiritual realization means knowledge. Not to become intoxicated. The spiritual... Just like this is spiritual knowledge. So what the intoxicated person will understand? Even a sane man cannot understand. Then how he will understand in intoxication? It is foolishness. They are suffering material pangs. By taking drugs the suffering is forgotten, and he is thinking that is the solution. Spiritual means negation of material distress. So he is always suffering from material distress. By taking drug, temporarily he forgets it. Therefore he misunderstands ""This is spiritual."" That's not spiritual. Then committing suicide is also spiritual? One man is suffering, and the suffering is so great he cannot tolerate, therefore he sometimes commits suicide. Is that committing suicide spiritual? Spiritual means negation of material distresses, that's a fact. But that is a different thing. When you come to the spiritual platform, not by artificially forgetting your material suffering. That is not spiritual."
Kim,"Another question. I asked earlier about the nature ofātman,now the nature ofBrahman?",Prabhupāda," Brahmanmeans the greatest, so as the sky, to our experience the sky is greater. What is the sky? The sky is a combination of small atoms. Do you know that? So if the sky isBrahman, then it is a combination of small atoms, then the small atoms are alsoBrahman? Just like a huge stack of rice, they are called rice, and a small grain of rice, that is also rice. So therefore there are two kinds ofBrahman—the component parts of theBrahmanthey are alsoBrahman, and wholeBrahmanis alsoBrahman. Do you follow?"
Kim,I hear the words.,Prabhupāda, Why don't you understand?
Kim,I follow the analogy of the rice.,Prabhupāda," The sky, theBrahman. What is the sky? A combination of atoms. So the component parts they are alsoBrahman, otherwise how it isBrahman? Unless the component parts areBrahman, how is itBrahman? It is a combination of many component parts, smallBrahman.ParamBrahman.ParamBrahmanmeans the supreme. The sea water, ocean water. Ocean water is very big, that isBrahman. Big meansBrahman. But what is this ocean water? Small molecules of water. Sometimes we see the sea waves, small molecules, cool. So it is combination of smallBrahman. So,sarvaṁkhalvidaṁbrahma.Everything isBrahman. And we are a small, very small fragmental portion ofBrahman. How small are we? One ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. We cannot see even the tip of the hair, very small point. And you have to divide it into ten thousand parts. And that one part—you, I, everyone. So small. So everything isBrahman. It is saidsarvakhalvidaṁbrahma.Everything isBrahman. Why? Because theBrahmanis very big, but what is this big? The big is a combination of small molecules, atoms. What is your idea ofBrahman?"
Kim,"From my own understanding I took it to be just the world, everything that is, but I don't understand.",Prabhupāda, Not clear idea.
Kim,I had an experience in New Zealand...,Prabhupāda," So therefore you have to experience from authority—what isBrahman. This is explanation ofBrahman. So thisBrahmanrealization is first, thenParamātmārealization, then God realization. Just like you realize the sunshine, very big, all over the universe, but you have to see wherefrom the sunshine is coming—the sun globe. That is localized. You are seeing just like a small ball, but actually this big thing, sunshine, is coming from it. Is it not? So which is important, the sunshine or the globe?"
Kim,"They are both important, but the sun is what produces the sunshine.",Prabhupāda," Similarly God the person is important, and by His bodily rays the whole thing is going on.Yasyaprabhāprabhavato [Bs.5.40]. Brahmaṇohi...Find out this verse-brahmaṇohipratiṣṭhāham."
Amogha,,Prabhupāda, Purport?
Amogha,"Purport: ""The constitution ofBrahmanis immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness.Brahmanis the beginning of transcendental realization;Paramātmā, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization; and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore bothParamātmāand the impersonalBrahmanare within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the seventh chapter that material nature is a manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity, conditioned by this material nature, begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to theBrahmanconception of the Supreme. This attainment of theBrahmanconception of life is the first stage of self-realization. At this stage, theBrahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect inBrahmanrealization. If he works, he can continue to stay in theBrahmanposition and then gradually rise up to the Paramatama realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonalBrahmanconception of truth, but then they graduallyroseto the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception ofBrahmanruns the risk of falling down. InŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamit is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonalBrahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to theBrahmanplatform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said,parasyavaisamhi evāyam labhvāndamhībhavati:when one understands the personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure,Kṛṣṇa, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.""",Prabhupāda," That is required. Our nature is blissfulness. Unless we reachKṛṣṇa, talk with Him, dance with Him, eat with Him, enjoy life, our perfection is imperfect, not complete. SimplyBrahmanrealization, just like simply to see, a child can see also the sunshine, but that does not mean he knows what is the sun, although the sunshine is coming from the sun. So unless you understand what is the actual sun, what is the person within the sun globe, our knowledge is imperfect. Simply realization of the big volume of sunshine, is not perfect. It is also light, and the sun globe is also light, heat. But this heat and light is not sufficient knowledge of the complete heat and light there. That is the difference betweenBrahmanrealization and God realization."
Kim,What can be said about God realization?,Prabhupāda," I have given the example. Just like this sunshine is coming from the sun globe. Within the sun globe there is the president of the planet. Just like here on this planet you have got some president. Here there are many presidents, because it is hodgepodge, chaotic. But there everything is systematic. There is one person, his name isVivasvān. He's the predominating deity.Kṛṣṇawent to see him and talked with him aboutBhagavad-gītā.He's a person, and there the people, they are also persons. Just like in this planet. But here the body is predominantly made of earth, and there the body is predominantly of fire. Therefore it is so glowing. The glowing temperature, heat and light, is coming from the person, their body is made of glowing heat or fire. There are five material elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. In some planet the earth is prominent, in some planet the water is prominent, in some planets the fire is prominent. So the sun planet is prominent with fire. There the bodies made of the inhabitants there are fire. So all the combination of the fiery effulgence is the heat of the sun globe and that is being distributed. It is in the (indistinct). You can see and realize. Everything is there. If you study nature you will get everything. (end)"
Amogha,"They think catching fish is great sport, great fun.",Prabhupāda, They haven't got any business. They must do all of these sinful activities. That is the defect of the modern civilization—keeping all men in darkness.
Jayadharma,Does that mean that the people that catch the fish have to also become fish?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. And who will become fish? That they do not know, how the transmigration of the soul is going on. They cannot explain wherefrom the fish are coming, wherefrom the trees are coming. Everything in darkness. And this civilization, this dark civilization, is going on, in the name of civilization. They cannot explain what is death, what is next life. Sometimes they say, ""It is nature,"" buthownature is working they do not know. All darkness,mūḍhānaabhijānāti,māmebhyaḥparama.The birds and beasts are also catching fish, and they are also catching. What is the difference? What is the difference? They have got this nice human body, and they are acting like birds and beasts. And they are kept in darkness. There is no enlightenment. This is the modern civilization. (pause) The smell. What is the smell?"
Amogha,"If we go up there, I don't think it will be there.",Prabhupāda, Some decomposed things? And this is not good for you. (pause) They fish this side?
Amogha,The birds? Seagulls.,Prabhupāda, He has got the human body. He also... These birds are catching fish. He does not know that he has got other business.
Amogha,"At the school, the students say, ""Why not eat fish? Jesus was passing out fish, in theBible.And we all catch fish. We like to catch fish."" And then we tell them about meat. So, they think that we are loosing a great pleasure, that we cannot eat meat.",Prabhupāda," You tell them, that you will be very merry—that's all right. But do you want to stop these merry affairs all of a sudden? Ask them, what will they reply?"
Amogha,"They'll say ""No, we don't want to stop.""",Prabhupāda," Then, the nature will stop it. What are you going to arrange for that?"
Amogha,"They say, ""We don't know what will happen after, so we'll just enjoy and have fun now, as much as possible.""",Prabhupāda, So why have you come to school? Why don't you play all day?
Amogha,Because we need to get a good job so we...,Prabhupāda," Then, they are thinking of future. Now we are thinking of the future. That is ignorance—that they do not know what is future life. They are thinking of the future, that's a fact, but because they are kept in darkness, about future life, they are doing all this irresponsible work."
Amogha,But nowadays people usually only go to school because the law requires it. Then at the age of...,Prabhupāda," Law requires or not requires, they are going to school with some future hope. So every sane man should think of the future. But because they are kept in darkness, they are all insane. They do not know what is the future of life. That is the defect. Everyone is thinking for future, but he does not know what is future after death. That is their ignorance. AndBhagavad-gītābegins that as the child has future, the boy has future, the young man has future, similarly the old man has also future. So that they do not know. That is their ignorance."
Amogha,"A lot of them will accept, ""Yes, there is future after death,"" but...",Prabhupāda," That he does not know, what is that future."
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"""Oh, yeah, we haven't discovered that right yet.""; Many of them say we cannot prove there is any life after death.",Prabhupāda," Yes, this if proof. Just as the boy is there and the father is there, the boy is going to become father. This is future. Both of them are there. The boy is going to be the father, and the father is going to be the grandfather. Where there is no future? The rascals, they do not know, say that, but there is future. How can you stop it? The boy is going to be father, the father is going to be grandfather. This is future."
Amogha,"But then he dies, and they cannot see any future after that.",Prabhupāda," Your seeing has no power. This is no argument, ""I cannot see."" I cannot see the other side. That does not mean there is nothing. This is all rascaldom. He has become authority ""I want to see."" What you can see? Now this is Indian Ocean. On the other side there is India, and other islands, but you cannot see it. Does it mean there is nothing? So, these are foolish questions. Because they are rascals they put such questions and nonsense. That is the proof that they are rascals. They are simply taking authority his little vision. That's all. What is your vision? Why don't you see what is the other side? But does it mean there is nothing because you cannot see? WHen one says ""I cannot see,"" that means he is a rascal number one. He's believing so much upon his seeing. He does not know that he is a most insignificant person, so there is no value of his seeing. That he does not know. Therefore he is a rascal. Is it not? He's believing his eyes so greatly that ""I cannot see."" And what is the value of your seeing? What you can see?"
Amogha,"But there are so many people who come to us and say, ""Well, we can see."" But we don't believe they can see.",Prabhupāda, What they can see?
Amogha,We don't think anyone can see.,Prabhupāda," No. Nobody can see. ThereforeVedassay your seeing should be through the book of knowledge. That is seeing. Not with your these rascal eyes. What is the value of these rascal eyes? We know that there is, through books, through geography, we know that the other side is India. Not by seeing with these eyes, by touching it or by smelling it. These senses are useless. But these rascals depend on the senses-sense perception. Therefore they are rascals. Imperfect sense perception they believe too much. Therefore they are rascals. They do not know the value of the senses.Mūḍhā.Paśyatijñāna-cakṣuṣā.That is seeing,jñānacakṣuṣa,by the eyes of knowledge, not by these imperfect senses.Paśyatijñānacakṣuṣa.Everyone is anxious for the future. Why do they keep bank balance? Thinking of the future. Why they make insurance? Why they make hospital insurance? Everyone is thinking of the future. But because he is rascal, he is thinking simply for this span of life.Tathādehāntaraprāptir.Again you have to accept another body. That they do not know. So rascal. Simply calculating for this span of life."
Paramahaṁsa,"We accept that, but in the next life we have a new future. This life we have this future, and in the next life we have...",Prabhupāda," Then suppose you become one..., what is called? Clam? And enter into this. Will that be a very good future? You have seen the, what is called, the crab (makes noise). They know everything—how to defend, how to eat, how to... You like that type of life?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Well I don't like it now, but if I was a crab I might like it.",Prabhupāda," Become a crab. That's all right. This is their solace. This is ignorance. You don't like it, but ""When I become crab, I'll like it."" That ismāyā'scovering. Otherwise he cannot live. If the crab thinks that ""I was king in my past life. Now I have become a crab,"" it would be horrible for him. Therefore he forgets. That is a concession ofmāyā.Forget whatever you have had. Just like here they try to forget by drinking, intoxication. That kind of forgetfulness is also happiness for the rascals. Nobody wants to be degraded. But if in degradation one forgets his past life, if that kind of happiness is happiness, you can do it. This is for the fools. The dog forgets that he was a prime minister in his past life, and his statue is now being worshiped in the memorial hall. And he has become a dog. (If) this kind of happiness is happiness, let him take it. Actually it is like this."
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, all of these things are relative anyway. So whether I am a dog or human being, it doesn't really make much difference, because I'm still existing.",Prabhupāda," Still, you don't want to become a dog when you are a human being."
Paramahaṁsa,But when I'm a dog I wouldn't want to become a human being either.,Prabhupāda," Yes, this means happiness in ignorance. That is ass. He's bearing two tons of load, and if he is thinking ""I am happy,"" it is nice. Therefore they are called ass. Accepting distress as happiness. Therefore they are called ass. That is the difference between ass and human being."
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"I saw some asses in the university yesterday. Asses and monkeys. One professor was working so hard he was almost crying, because he had so many exams to mark. So great burden on his mind.; Isn't it, then, if one is happy, that's all that counts? If his happiness is also relative. So if I am a monkey...",Prabhupāda," No. There is absolute happiness. You do not know that. We are meant for that, because we are living beings. But on account of your ass quality you do not like to understand.Mūḍhānābhijānāti."
Amogha,"My parents used to tell me that nothing can be absolutely true, because everything is really finer shades of grey.",Prabhupāda, He has no idea what is absolute truth. He is in darkness. He does not know there is absolute world. This is the relative worlds.
Amogha,"They think that people who say there is Absolute Truth have not observed the other thoughts of other people, so they haven't seen everything.",Prabhupāda, What is that other thought? We know everyone's thought. We know everyone's thought.
Amogha,"In the university newspaper I was reading, all their discussion is about things like homosexuality is all right or not all right.",Prabhupāda, Ācchā?They are discussing?
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa; Amogha,"Yes. In the newspaper articles in the university. The homosexuals are campaigning for equal rights. And there is a big debate whether homosexuals are good or bad. All over the world there are homosexuals, and also they are arguing over Palestine and Israel. And sometimes (indistinct) In Melbourne there was fighting between people who support Israel and Palestine. All these arguments they have in the newspapers.; Even in Los Angeles they have a group of homosexuals who used to get harassed by people all the time. So now they have become a military group, and they carry weapons. And if anybody harasses them, they shoot them. They're called Militant Homosexuals.; In one high school here they asked the question whether we accept homosexuality. And I said, ""Of course not. This is only a perversion."" And they said, ""This is nature's way to stop overpopulation,"" because there won't be any children. So much foolish.",Prabhupāda," How degraded the human society is becoming. And the children, they are discussing."
Amogha; Jayadharma; Paramahaṁsa; Amogha,"It seems that step by step, in the law courts and the judges, everyone is step by step accepting more and more degradation, and makind it legal, everything.; Even when a man commits first-degree murder he only gets ten years' jail. There are cases of people committing cold-blooded murder and only getting ten years' jail. And then after that, getting out again and doing the same thing.; They think that ""This poor man was psychologically disturbed and killed someone."" So they give him ten years in jail, then they say, ""Now he is rehabilitated, he has been very nice, and in the prison he was acting very nicely, so we want him to be happy. So we'll let him out on parole as long as he's good."" Then they let him out.; That's why we take your books to the prisons. Sometimes we have a contest to see who can distribute the most books in three days. When they were deciding who would go with Madhudviṣa Swami to India, they had a contest to see who could distribute the most books and get the mostlaxmīat the same time. So they would collect muchlaxmī,then they would go out and give away books to the prisons and jails and hospitals. Cases of books. They put them in the libraries too. They agreed; otherwise they didn't get. They would ask them if they would use it, and they said yes. So in three days they distributed very, very many books.",Prabhupāda, Free?
Amogha,"Yes. First they collected the money elsewhere, then they gave it away to the hospitals and prisons. One boy he collected in one day, he won the contest, he collected seven hundred and fifty dollars in one day. Australian dollars. That's almost one thousand U.S. dollars. I don't remember how many books, very, very many books he gave away also. Big books, hardbound books,Kṛṣṇabooks,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.",Prabhupāda," So, you are trying to serveKṛṣṇavery nicely. That is very good. These rascals are in ignorance and you are trying to enlighten them. Very good service. [break] After reading a book does anybody come and ask questions? Do they receive regularly letters and enquiries?"
Amogha,"Yes. Here they do. I answer many of the letters when they come. Last week, just before we came over to Perth, one boy wrote a letter, he said, ""I cannot come to your temple, but I am a student in Geelong""—that's one city near Melbourne—""And when I come to Melbourne I always get yourBack to Godheadmagazine."" So he said, ""How can I become a member of theHareKṛṣṇamovement?"" So I wrote him a letter telling him about getting more books and chanting. And one man wrote us a letter from New Zealand. He said, ""I haveŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamparts one, two and three. Can you please tell me how many other parts I can get, because I want to have them all.""",Prabhupāda, That is very good.
Amogha,"And in the schools they have comparative religion courses, and they usually write us a letter saying, ""Can you please tell us, for our comparative religions class, what you believe and what is behind your movement?"" And things like this. And if they are close enough we usually go there, or if not we write them and send them some literature. Everyone in the classes I find in the schools, everyone is bored with the ideas they are teaching. Everyone has heard it all, and they are bored. But when we come, they become very interested. Just like at one school. We had one hour. We showed the film, then we talked and answered questions for one hour, and then the bell rang. It was time for their next class. So the teacher said, ""Students, shall we go to the next class or stay here?"" And they said, ""Oh, let's stay here. This is much better."" So they stayed for one more hour. Their teaching is so dry, but we handed outmahā-prasādam,and it was very interesting. Usually in each class there are three or four students who are especially pious, and they come, they stay afterwards and ask many questions. We can also see that they are more affected by the understanding than the other students.",Prabhupāda, This road is good. There is no traffic.
Paramahaṁsa,All of the temples they are receiving letters regularly from (indistinct),Prabhupāda," It is not meant for mass people. Only selected fortunate. MyGuruMahārājaused to say, ""If I could make one person to beKṛṣṇaconscious, then my mission would be successful."" It is not for mass person. Only the fortunate they can do.CaitanyaMahāprabhu, by introducingsaṅkīrtana,even the mass can take part. When there issaṅkīrtana,everyone joins. And by joining in that way, they will become purified."
Amogha,"In Sydney, the city council once tried to stop us, legally, from chanting in the streets. First they arrested us two years ago, but then they spent many dollars of tax money to prepare a case for the court, and they didn't even tell us. They had the court session, and the judge ruled that ""ThisHareKṛṣṇachanting in the streets is good. It adds color to the city and is not illegal. Why you are saying this is illegal? This is their right. And it makes the city more colorful.""",Prabhupāda, Nice judge. God gave him sense.
Amogha,"So actually many people like to see the chanting now. When we go downtown with a big party on Friday and Saturday nights, when they have late-night shopping and movies, many people clap, and they dance a little bit. Sometimes mocking, but also one can see they're affected. And usually if we stop in front of a cinema and chant there, fifty or more people they just stop and they stare, and they can't think of anything else. They just watch and watch and watch. They seem to be fascinated by the sound of Kṛṣṇa's name.",Prabhupāda, There is a natural tendency to hear. Artificially they stopped.Nityasiddhakṛṣṇabhakti.Appeals to the heart immediately. Unless he is too much sinful it will appeal immediately.
Amogha,"In Sydney there was one teacher in a school, a private school, for rich men's sons, very, very wealthy. And he is the head of general studies and the school chaplain. A Christian. One boy from the school became a devotee, although he still went to the school. And the discussion came up in class about what theHareKṛṣṇaś believe. So he invited us to come.",Prabhupāda, The clergyman?
Amogha,"Yes, school chaplain, and he liked it so much. I remember he was taking notes, and he was smiling every time one point came up that he liked. So he asked us to come again the next week, and again, and then the next time we went through six classes in one day. For about two months he asked us again and again, and then to show the film. And he was always taking notes. He would say, ""What was that again? Part and parcel?""",Prabhupāda, He is sincere.
Amogha,"Yes, he was very sincere. Then one day he came to the temple on Sunday because I invited him. He wanted to make sure, he wanted to find out the difference between us and Christianity. But he was convinced in the end that the main philosophy is the same point, the same purpose.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,"And he ate a big plate ofprasādam.He liked it very much. So he was saying that perhaps we can have some regular comparative religion course in the school, and when we show the students, tell them aboutHareKṛṣṇamovement as a study, about, as he calls it, our religion, so they can also come in a bus to the temple.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Amogha,The students will come in a bus and see how we chant and have someprasādam.,Prabhupāda, It is a good reception. So that is still going on?
Amogha,"It hasn't started yet. This is the plan. But sometimes he hesitates, because he has doubts.",Prabhupāda, Superstition. That is superstition.
Amogha,"He gets in bad association, and then he begins to doubt a little bit, I think.",Prabhupāda," You do your duty, that's all. (pause) What is this? Stone or something?"
Amogha,"Part of the street I think. I think it's sandstone from the beach. (pause) Many politicians are afraid that Australia may be attacked by the Communists. Everyone is very much afraid of what could happen in the future, because the United States is becoming weaker.",Prabhupāda," Now they are indulging homosex, how they will become strong? And the students, they are discussing, that means they are having. The stamina is being lost. Now what they have created, it will be lost."
Amogha,"They all seem to think that spiritual life is something to think about, something...",Prabhupāda, Not very important.
Amogha,Yes. They think it's not practical action. They think practical action is politics or some physical thing like the hospital. Money.,Prabhupāda," It means they have no idea of the spiritual identity. Their idea is that matter is important. But they do not know that matter is not important, but the spirit is important. That is moving the matter. It is very easy to understrand. Because the spirit soul is within this body, it is moving. But they cannot understand-dull-headed. What is that force that is moving this body? That they do not consider to understand."
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? When people in the street hear Kṛṣṇa's name, the chanting, or they get some literature, does that mean they will not take birth as an animal?",Prabhupāda," No. They'll get birth in a good family.Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].If they simply appreciate ""It is very nice,"" then in the next life, human life is guaranteed. In a very nice family. Simply if he appreciates, ""Yes, it is very nice""—that's all. Then he'll get another chance."
Amogha,Many people think the pictures are very nice.,Prabhupāda," Anything they say nice, that means it is guaranteed, next life. Or even in this life it will definitely help. As soon as he reads some pages, then it is guaranteed. Those who are enquiring, that means they are liking. Their life is guaranteed."
Amogha,"One man who joined us about Rathayātrā time last year was a solicitor. He used to buy our books but he never read them. But he would keep them on his bookshelf. And he used to always think, ""Those are such beautiful books."" He used to think like that.",Prabhupāda, This is appreciation.
Amogha,He never got time to read it.,Prabhupāda," It doesn't matter. If he keeps the books with appreciation, that makes his life sure, insured. He immediately becomes in touch with God. Who keeps the book with reverence and love, immediately he becomes in touch with God. Because these books are representative of God."
Amogha,"When we go to a school, I first ask, ""How many students have seen us chanting in the steets?"" Immediately they all raise their hands.",Prabhupāda," It is a very nice service you are doing.Kṛṣṇawill be satisfied,hari-toṣaṇa.As soon asKṛṣṇais satisfied, your preaching is perfect. (end)"
Amogha; Carol,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Carol Cameron from the University of West Australia. She has a degree in Social Work, in Arts, and she's working on a Master's Degree in Anthropology. In this degree her paper is on the subject of the influence ofHinduand Buddhist mysticism on the West. So she would like to ask you some questions. This is our spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.; I would like to know why in the beginning why you came to the West. I know a bit about your background, but not very much. Why you saw the need to come.",Prabhupāda," That I was speaking. Of course, it is very strong words. That Western people they are claiming very civilized, but I have got objection. Therefore I have come to the West. Because, for example, the animal-killing. The Western people are mostly Christians. Now, Lord Jesus Christ said that ""Thou shall not kill."" But the result was that two thousand years passed, but the people of the Western countries, they are still killing. So when they have accepted Christianity? What is your answer?"
Carol,But the actual original scriptures aren't enacted in Western life.,Prabhupāda," I mean to say that Lord Jesus Christ said, ""Thou shall not kill."" So, what kind of men were there that Lord Christ had to request them not to kill? That means they were killers. Suppose if somebody's thief, and if I give him some good instruction, I say ""You should not commit theft."" That means you are thief. You are already. Otherwise why I say that ""Thou shall not commit theft""? A naughty child is disturbing. I say, ""My dear child, don't do this."" Similarly, when Christ said, ""Thou shall not kill,"" that means he said amongst people who were in the habit of killing. Is it not?"
Carol,Hmm.,Prabhupāda," Now, after taking instruction from Christ, first of all they killed Christ. That means they could not understand the instruction. Therefore their first business was to kill the instructor. And after that, two thousand years passed, still they are killing. So when they have accepted the teachings of Lord Christ? Can you answer this?"
Carol,So you think the Christian faith hasn't been reflected in the behavior of Western people.,Prabhupāda," This is practical. You are maintaining huge slaughterhouses, regular killing. So, you took instruction from Christ, ""Thou shall not kill."" You first of all killed him, and then the killing process is going on among the animals, and declaring wars every now and then. So the killing business is going on regularly. In your regular life also. You are maintaining big, big slaughterhouses. Then when you accepted the instruction of Christ? That I want to know. What is that date?"
Carol,Do you see any hope for the world? We seem to be moving towards destruction.,Prabhupāda," No, my... You just explain."
Amogha; Carol,"He's asking you when did this civilization actually accept the teachings of Christ?; When have they? Not overall at all, only in small pockets. Never overall.",Prabhupāda, Then why you are claiming that you are Christian? Just like you are having cross. That is the sign that you killed Christ. The cross is the killing symbol of Christ.
Carol,This is the resurrection symbol.,Prabhupāda, Maybe. (laughter)
Carol,But it's not only Christian symbol...,Prabhupāda," But many, many priestly order, they carry the cross. Cross is the sign when Lord Jesus Christ was killed. Is it not?"
Carol,"It is, but that symbol is used in a lot of ways.",Prabhupāda," That means how you killed Lord Jesus Christ. That is the sign. That reminds you that you killed. You accuse the Jewish people ""They killed,"" but you are also killing. Although you are claiming Christian. Therefore I want to know—you are a learned scholar—when you abided by the order of Lord Jesus Christ? That is my question. When?"
Amogha; Carol,When did you abide by the orders of Jesus Christ?; When did I?,Prabhupāda," Every one of you, Western countries. And if you have abided by the order of Jesus Christ, then why you are systematically killing? The order is, ""Thou shall not kill."""
Carol,"It reminds me of theGītā,you know? WhereArjunais on the battlefield about to commit an organized sort of killing against his relatives.",Prabhupāda," No, two thousand years passed, but you could not accept the instruction of Lord Jesus Christ. And you are all claiming that you are Christian. When did you accept Christianity? That is my question. Because you have disobeyed the order of Christ. So when did you accept? Two thousand years passed. Hmm? Who will answer this question?"
Jayadharma,Never.,Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Jayadharma; Carol,They never accepted.; Hmm. What is the main part of your philosophy? Is it based on theVedāntaschool?,Prabhupāda, No. This is no question of philosophy. You could not accept the simple instruction. Then where is the question of philosophy?
Carol,The question of love.,Prabhupāda," Yes. You cannot understand the principles of life and morality, Jesus Christ's instruction that ""Thou shall not kill."" So how you become philosopher?"
Carol; Gaṇeśa,"How is the love to be understood? Between people or through inner sort of communication with a higher self?; Śrīla Prabhupāda said that you could not understand the simple instruction, so where is the question of understanding philosophy? Not love. Philosophy.",Prabhupāda," You have no love, because you are accustomed to kill. Philosophy begins when you know that everyone is part and parcel of God, and everyone should be given the full facilities to live without injuring anyone for one's personal benefit.Paṇḍitaḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].Apaṇḍita,philosopher, means learned scholar. Not fools and rascals can become philosopher. Those who are learned scholar, thoughtful, they can become philosopher. But if one has no knowledge how to behave with other living entities, what is the meaning of becoming a philosopher?"
Carol,How would you go about teaching this idea of love?,Prabhupāda," Love means that I want to eat something, and if I love somebody, then I will see that my beloved also eats. If you take something from your beloved, naturally the lovers present things. Just a boy loves a girl. He presents something to the girl. So, if you accept presentation by others, we should give him also something. And, if I have got some confidential thing, I must disclose it to the lover, and the lover is also expected, he should not keep anything confidential. He should disclose it. These are the six reciprocal exchanges between the lover and the beloved. If I love you, because you are beautiful, for my sense gratification, but I keep everything secret, that is not love. That is sense gratification. Lust. These are the signs of love."
Carol,"Do you think a man who says he loves God should withdraw from the world, say into a community or something like that?",Prabhupāda," First of all between two. Then you can expand it. First the love between-love means there are two, the lover and the beloved. So, the transaction begins between the two, then it expands."
Carol; Amogha,"How do you go if you look at the two as say the creator and the person? Would that be the two that you have in mind? How would you go about fostering that relationship?; She says if you mean by the two the creator and us, how would you go about fostering or increasing that relationship between us and...",Prabhupāda," Creator, created. Do you believe in creator?"
Carol,"Impersonal creator, yes.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Amogha,She says impersonal creator.,Prabhupāda, Impersonal?
Amogha,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Oh, what is that philosophy? Impersonal creator?"
Carol,Without any attributes that we can...,Prabhupāda," Creator is an attribute. To become creator, that is attribute. If I create this bell, I know the art of how to create a bell."
Carol,Hmm.,Prabhupāda," So, this is my attribute. How you can say the creator is without attribute? This is false philosophy. I know how to create this bell. That is my artistic sense. That is my qualification. And how you say I am without qualification? As soon as you say ""creator,"" then He has got many qualifications."
Carol,How can ignorance be removed?,Prabhupāda," The ignorant people can also learn from the learned. If you have got this idea that creator is impersonal, that means you are not a learned. You have no knowledge. And this is the simple answer. As soon as you say ""creator,"" He has so many qualities. The bell... Suppose I am ringing. Now, when the spring is loose, it does not sound. So, others may not know, but one who has created—""Oh, the spring is loose. Now we wind it again."" That means I know, ins and outs and everything. That is creator. So, if one is cognizant of everything, how He can be impersonal? What is this philosophy? Hmm? Answer. You are philosopher."
Amogha; Carol,"He says if the creator, if one is cognizant of everything, then how can He not be a person? The creator is cognizant of everything. So if He is cognizant, how can He not be a person?; Well, He would incorporate personal attributes...",Prabhupāda," Hmm? She says ""He."""
Carol,...not be governed by them.,Prabhupāda," She says ""He,"" but He is impersonal. (laughter)"
Carol,Yes. (laughs) It's the intellect and the emotion.,Prabhupāda," How vague ideas. And they are passing on philosophy. ""He"" contradicts. You say ""He."" And again He is impersonal."
Carol,At the emotional level it's a very personal...,Prabhupāda, Why should you emotional? You are a philosopher. You should talk very nicely.
Carol; Amogha; Carol; Amogha; Carol; Amogha; Carol,"Talk?; He said, why be emotional? You are a philosopher, so talk very nicely.; Oh. (surprised) I don't philosophize.; What she just said was that He is impersonal, but He incorporates personal features?; If God is in everything, then the personal attributes must be part of Him, it, whatever.; She says personal attributes are part of God.; But God is not just limited to...",Prabhupāda, You have no idea of God.
Carol,No. I don't think...,Prabhupāda," He must be person. As soon as you say ""He knows everything,"" ""He creates,"" and so many other things, then these are all personal. You say ""He."" ""He."" These are all personal."
Carol,"This in only our idea of God though, not necessarily...",Prabhupāda, That means you have no clear idea of God. You have vague idea. So you have to learn what is God.
Carol; Amogha,You think you can know the nature of God?; She says do you think you can know the nature of God?,Prabhupāda, Yes. You can know also.
Carol,In an intellectual way?,Prabhupāda, You can know also.
Carol,You might know something in your heart but not be able to express it.,Prabhupāda," Why not express it? You can express it. If whatever is within your heart, if you cannot express, then you are not perfect. You must express what is within your heart very clearly. Not that I have got something within my heart and I cannot express. That means my knowledge is imperfect."
Carol,"So often our understanding moves sort of separately the emotional, the heart.",Prabhupāda," Emotion is not required for scientific knowledge. Emotion is not. Useless. It must be factual. Emotion is no use. Emotion is useful in high, ecstatic love. Not for scientific study of something you require emotion. No."
Carol,"In thebhaktiway of doing things, this emotion and love are very closely entwined, aren't they?",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is higher stage. Not in the beginning. In the beginning devotion means I should be devoted to you. Why should I be devoted to you unless you are worthy? Just likeKṛṣṇasays, ""You surrender unto Me."" So unless I understand thatKṛṣṇais worth for my surrendering, He is worthy, why shall I surrender toKṛṣṇa? If I demand, immediately you have come, that you surrender. Would you like to do that?"
Carol,To surrender?,Prabhupāda, If I ask you that you surrender. I am meeting you for the first time. Would you like to surrender?
Carol,Yes.,Prabhupāda, I don't think. (laughter)
Carol,To want to and to do it is different.,Prabhupāda," No, unless you are fully aware of my abilities, qualities, why should you surrender? (indistinct) So, before surrendering, one has to study the person where he is going to surrender. Then he surrenders. That is real surrender. And blindly surrender, that will not stay. So, our first business is to surrender to God; therefore we must know what is God. Then you must surrender. And, the emotion is good. That means you are advanced. If you understand that God is giving us everything. So, that emotion is very good. If one from the very beginning becomes emotional, ""Oh, God is so kind. God is so great, that He is giving us everything, our necessities. Imustserve Him."" This emotion is very good. But for ordinary man, this emotion does not come. He wants to study what is God. Then when he fully understands, ""Oh, God is so great."" Then that emotion is very nice. That is genuine emotion. Otherwise emotion is sentiment. That will not stay. That will not endure. It is temporary."
Carol,Would the intellect be helpful in knowing God?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Unless you have got the necessary intellect, then you are no better than the animals. The animals have no intellect to understand God, but the human being has got that intellect. That is the distinction between animal and human being. [break] Sleeping, the human being also sleeps; they also sleep. Then sex enjoyment: the human being also enjoy, and the animals also enjoy. And protection from fear or becoming fearful—the human being is also fearful and arranges for protection, and the animal also does. So far the primary necessities of life, that is equal in animal and human being. But the human being has a special intellect developed than the animals that he can understand what he is, what is God, what is this cosmic manifestation, and what is the aim of life, how we should conduct. These things are prerogatives for the human being. The animals have no such prerogative. So if we do not utilize these special intellectual activities, then we remain animal. We do not make any development. So at the present moment they are improving the method of primary necessities of life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are thinking the dog is eating on the floor; if we can eat on table, chair and nice dish, that is advancement of civilization. They are thinking like that. The dog is sleeping on the floor, and if we sleep in very nice apartment, very decorated, that is advancement of civilization. The dog is having sexual intercourse on the street without any shame, and we are also coming to that point already. And if we have sex intercourse in the name of love and so on, so on, that is advancement. And dog is defending with his jaws and nails and teeth, you are defending with atomic bomb, therefore we are advanced. But they have forgotten that the human being has got this special intellect to understand God. That they are not doing. Just like you are going to be a doctor in anthropology. Is it not?"
Carol,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Where is the sense of God there?
Carol,I only do it for a living. The other side of me is something...,Prabhupāda, No. I mean to say the anthropology it is a big scientific department. Where is the understanding of God there?
Carol,I find it difficult to reconcile the love of God with actually doing something like this.,Prabhupāda, Then how you are going to speculate on anthropology?
Carol,Hmm.,Prabhupāda," If you cannot adjust, how you are wasting your time in the science, anthropology? It is a false science."
Carol,I'm waiting to be led into something which is good.,Prabhupāda, There is no meaning.
Carol,Yes. You can only decide in...,Prabhupāda," The whole theory, Darwin's theory, is a false theory. It has no sound background. He says it is theory. Theory is not science. I can propose some theory, ""It is like that."" But that is not science. Science means observation and experiment. That is science. You observe how the rules are working, and when you practically bring them into experiment, then it is science. If you simply theorize, that is not science. Mental speculation. It has no benefit. You can speculate, constructing a castle in the air. That is not a very good thing. You should present something which will benefit the people, and practical. That is science."
Carol,"Do you think it is possible to live in say an education framework, or should it be something quite separate?",Prabhupāda," Education, if it is not for the benefit of the people, then what is the use of such education? That is not a good education. Education means something which will benefit the mass of people. That is education. To enlighten them to do something better. That is education. And this whole Darwin's theory is false. But people are giving too much stress. First of all, anyone, even Darwin, he's not independent. Just like Darwin has died. So, he is under the control of something higher. Nobody wants to die, but he is forced to die. Is it not? Then where is his independence?"
Carol,That is the illusion.,Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Amogha,She says that is the illusion of independence.,Prabhupāda," ? Yes, so if you simply in illusion you live, then where is your education? If you remain in darkness, then where is your education? Illusion means darkness. So if you are in darkness, now what is your education? And where is your philosophy?"
Carol,The only way to remove this darkness is through love. Is this what you are saying?,Prabhupāda, Love is far away. First of all you be educated.
Carol,How? In what way?,Prabhupāda," Education means right knowledge. Right knowledge. Just like, everyone wants to live. Nobody wants to die. So, the enquiry should be that ""I do not wish to die. Why death is forced upon me?"" What is that force? What is the nature of that force? If I submit, ""Yes, the force is there,"" then where is my knowledge? I do not wish to die. So why death is forced upon me? Nobody wants miserable condition of life, but miserable condition of life is enforced upon me. So this should be first of all enquired, that I do not want these things, and who is enforcing upon me these things? This is the first enquiry, philosophical."
Carol,"I tend to approach from the other side and ask ""Who am I?"" and ""What is this thing that I call myself?""",Prabhupāda," It is everyone's problem. I don't want something, but something is enforced upon me. Just like you are now a young girl. You do not like to be old woman. But you will have to become old woman."
Carol; Amogha; Carol,"Become?; Old woman.; Oh, yes. Hmm.",Prabhupāda," Nature will force you that after forty years of age you must become old, and you must not remain so beautiful. This is forced. But no one wants that. No woman wants that ""I shall look not beautiful and my flesh should be flabby and no more luster. I don't want all these things."" Why it is forced?"
Carol,"Suffering and pain leads people to God, doesn't it?",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Amogha,She says doesn't the suffering and pain lead people towards God?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is the law, but we are so dull-headed that we do not enquire. That is my statement, that you should enquire ""Who is forcing these things?"" Then there is enquiry of God. First of all we must be... Just like a dog. He cannot understand. He's under chain. He's leading a life most dependent. And he is jolly. He is jumping here and there. That is dog's life. If the master kills him, he cannot do anything. But he is very jolly. He is jumping. That is dog's life. But not human life. Human life is that I am dependent in every step, still I am declaring independent. What is this nonsense? This enquiry should be there. He is dependent in every step, exactly like the cats and dogs, but he is claiming, ""I am independent."""
Carol,Is it possible to carry out that enquiry while you're engaged in activities?,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is the real enquiry. Wherefrom my life has begun? What is the ultimate goal of my life? Why I am put into these conditions which I do not like? Who is enforcing? These things should be asked. That is the proper enquiry of the human being. And we cannot solve the question of birth, death, old age and disease, and you are theorizing something utopian. What is the use of such advancement of knowledge? I live for fifty years and sixty years, and the Darwin's theory they are calculating gap of millions of years. There is a gap of millions of years, and we will live for fifty years. How we are taking calculation of millions of years? Speculation simply. And misleading people. An honest man should not mislead others. He should understand that his knowledge is limited. How can I say something theorizing? That is not very good business. And misleading people. I have no perfect knowledge. I am theorizing. What is the use? I have no actually accurate knowledge, and I am theorizing. I am misleading people. Big bluff. That is going on. An honest man should not take part in big bluffs. First of all you must have accurate knowledge, and I am theorizing. I am misleading people. Big bluffs. First of all you must have accurate knowledge. Then you bring knowledge to others. That is our proposition. First of all make your life perfect, then you try to give knowledge. If you have no knowledge, vague knowledge, not definite knowledge, then why should you try to give knowledge to others?"
Carol,Can you have perfect knowledge?,Prabhupāda, What?
Carol,"Can you have perfect knowledge,...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Carol,"I mean ultimately you might say that I might be able to have some, but it's still a bit doubtful. In the near future how could you ever...",Prabhupāda," Perfect knowledge you can immediately, provided you take knowledge from the perfect. If you receive knowledge from a bogus person, then how you can have perfect knowledge? Knowledge has to be received from a person. Why shall I go to a school, college, teachers,guru? To receive knowledge. So if your teacher,guruor parent, those who are your superior, if they are perfect, then you get perfect knowledge. But if your teacher is a bogus, then you get bogus knowledge."
Carol; Amogha,"And this is immediate, is it?; She says is this immediate, the reception of perfect knowledge?",Prabhupāda, Yes. Just like we are giving knowledge fromBhagavad-gītā.This is perfect knowledge. You take it; you become perfect.
Carol,And your actions are perfect actions?,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Amogha,And your actions are perfect actions?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Just like in theBhagavad-gītāyou'll find—you have readBhagavad-gītā?No."
Carol,Mmm.,Prabhupāda," It is said,man-manābhavamad-bhakto.Think of God. So we are doing this.HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇa—we are thinking ofKṛṣṇa. THe direction is there, and we are doing that. Therefore my action is perfect. If the physician says that you take this medicine in such and suchdose, you don't do this, and do this. If I follow, then I'm cured, perfect."
Carol,Does a man then stop judging his actions?,Prabhupāda," No, if I know that the knowledge which I am receiving from the person is perfect, then there is no question of judging. You simply follow."
Carol,So it's a matter of complete faith.,Prabhupāda," Just like a child. Child assumes that my father is perfect. So, actually a father should be perfect at least for the child. So whatever the father, mother, gives him knowledge, that is perfect. Father says, ""My dear child, this is called 'table.' "" The child does not know what is table, but he understand from his father. He says, ""This is table."" So when the child says it is table, it is fact. This is perfect. He may be imperfect, his child, but because he is repeating the perfect knowledge of his father, whatever he is speaking is perfect. Because he has received the knowledge. Actually the child inquires from the father, ""Father, what is this?"" Father smiles at child, ""This is called bell. If you push your hand in this."" Then you get the perfect knowledge. He tries it. Oh, it is coming. The knowledge is there. He may be imperfect, but the instruction he has received, that is perfect. Similarly, if you get instruction from the perfect, then your knowledge is perfect, and if you receive knowledge—just like anthropology—from an imperfect person, Darwin, then whole thing is imperfect. So why should we waste our time in imperfect knowledge?"
Carol,Because there are few people around us who think they are perfect.,Prabhupāda," That is another thing, that people want to be cheated, so I shall be perfect cheater. (laughter) That is another thing. And take my doctorate title, being a perfect cheater."
Carol; Amogha,"If you look for those who are perfect, you don't find any.; She says there are so few perfect people, if you look for a perfect person, you don't find any.",Prabhupāda," Therefore we are giving-here isKṛṣṇa. Here is the perfect person. You take. But you don't follow Him. Just like I began with. Jesus Christ is perfect, but you don't follow him."
Carol,Mmm.,Prabhupāda," You don't like to follow him. You follow Darwin. Whose fault it is? The perfect person's fault, or your fault? You don't like to hear from the perfect person. You want to hear from a humbug bogus person. That is the defect. (long silence)"
Carol,Thank you. Thank you.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa.
Gaṇeśa,All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.,Prabhupāda, Give him someprasāda.
Amogha; Carol; Amogha,"He's bringing something for you.; We have your record, theRādhā-KṛṣṇaTemple album. It's beautiful. We sing the chants every night now. They're rather lovely.; She says she has theRādhā-KṛṣṇaTemple album, and every night they sing the chants. At home. They have the record from London.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Carol,They're pretty hard to get hold of. I wish there were more around.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that will benefit. That will benefit."
Amogha; Carol,"They are available by mail from America.; I think a lot of people don't know it exists, that's the problem.",Prabhupāda, That record which was done by George Harrison?
Carol,Yes. It's very rare to find music like that here.,Prabhupāda," George Harrison has contributed many. He gave me first of all nineteen thousand dollars for printingKṛṣṇabook. Now he has purchased one house in London, and we are using that. It is two hundred thousand pounds. Yes, he is a good boy, good soul."
Carol,"You don't have a group in Perth, do you?",Prabhupāda," He is also chantingHareKṛṣṇa. Yes. He chants all dayHareKṛṣṇa. He has made some record, ""Kṛṣṇa."""
Amogha,"""My dear Lord, I really want to see You."" Something like that.",Prabhupāda," Like that, yes. ""Kṛṣṇa"" he has said."
Śrutakīrti; Amogha,"Yes. His latest album, ""Kṛṣṇa Where Are You?""; Oh, I haven't seen it.",Prabhupāda," And in the record album he has given this picture. So you are intelligent girl, you study about thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That will benefit you. The anthropology you may get some degree, adoration. What is the benefit?Jaya.(Carol leaves) They enquire why I have come to the West. If I enquire that two thousand year ago you have been taught that ""Thou shall not kill,"" and your business is only to kill. I have come to enquire from you, ""What is your answer?"" How you have become civilized, that you cannot accept one instruction of Jesus Christ. And you are declaring yourself as Christian and civilized. This is my question. Answer it. In two thousand years, first of all you began killing Christ. Never mind, still, two thousand years past, you could not stop killing? You could not accept the first instruction. What kind of civilized man?"
Jayadharma,"Sometimes they say, Prabhupāda, that Jesus meant just...",Prabhupāda, Meant?
Jayadharma,...just human beings.,Prabhupāda," All right. That means you are killer of human beings. THat means, in the beginning, you are all killers of human beings. And therefore you killed Jesus Christ. That is not very good qualification. Killer of human being... He said ""Thou shall not kill."" Where he says that ""Thou shall not kill human beings""? That is your interpretation."
Śrutakīrti,"That's obvious he meant only human beings, because he himself was killing animals.",Prabhupāda, Christ was killing animals?
Śrutakīrti,"Well, he instructed his own disciples to distribute the fish. So he was also involved in killing of animals.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but he said that the fuits and vegetable should be your flesh. What is that?"
Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa; Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa,"Well, that was before Christ. He never said that.; He also said that.; Where does he say that?; He said that in the (inaudible). Yes. TheBiblesays that and Christ also spoke that, that the grasses of the fields and the fruits of the trees shall be your meat.",Prabhupāda, Then there is contradiction?
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes. The Christians always say that Christ was eating fish and drinking wine, so what problem have we got? Drinking a little alcohol, eating a little meat?",Prabhupāda," Then how did he say that ""Thou shall not kill""?"
Śrutakīrti; Gaṇeśa; Śrutakīrti,That was actually the Ten Commandments. That was given by God.; Given to Moses.; That was given to Moses by God. The Ten Commandments.,Prabhupāda, That is not Christ has said?
Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa; Śrutakīrti,"Well, Christ enforced it.; It was accepted by him as one of the rules.; Christ's greatest commandment was to love God above all things. So if one is to love God, one must follow His instructions.",Prabhupāda, Who is following the instructions?
Śrutakīrti,We are.,Prabhupāda," But supposing Christ distributed fish, but did he say that we shall maintain regular slaughterhouse for killing animals?"
Śrutakīrti; Paramahaṁsa; Gaṇeśa,"He was against that. He threw the men out of the temple, because they were selling lambs in the temple to be offered at the altar. So he kicked them out, saying this temple is not a place for selling animals for slaughter.; But in one place they say Christ encouraged fishermen. Because he came and the fishermen were fishing on one side of the boat, and Christ came along and said, ""You are fishing on the wrong side of the boat."" He said, ""Put your nets on the other side, and you will get more fish."" An they did that and they got huge amounts of fish. And so they were encouraged in their fish-eating in this way.; Jesus also said to the fisherman, ""Give up you fishing and I will make you fishers of men."" He said this to his disciples.",Prabhupāda, Then on the whole it comes that his instructions are sometimes contradictory.
Paramahaṁsa,"Not only that but they say that... Usually when it comes right down to it, theBiblehas gone through so many interpretations and so many changes in the last two thousand years that...",Prabhupāda, Yes. It is very difficult.
Paramahaṁsa,"People..., I've talked to professors who know the original Hebrew and the original tongues that theBiblewas written in. They say that is has changed so much that you can hardly...",Prabhupāda," Yes, they are changing. Just like he said, ""Thou shall not kill."" They are now changing, ""Thow shall not commit murder."" They are doing that."
Paramahaṁsa,"Yes. They have a modernBible,using all modern terminology.",Prabhupāda," So, when you change, then the authority is lost. Just like in our society, sometimes they do something nonsense and they say, ""Prabhupāda said."" (laughter) They are doing that. We know that. It is deteriorated like that. ThereforeKṛṣṇasaid,sakālenehamahatāyogonaṣṭaḥkaunteya:""And in due course of time, thisyogawas lost. Therefore I am repeating the same thing, old philosophy to you."" So it requires like that."
Paramahaṁsa,"One thing about the Christian religion is that through the last two thousand years, Christ's original teachings may have been good teachings, may have been potent preaching, but because there were no potent preachers to carry on the preaching, therefore the whole thing has been lost. But if there are potent preachers to continue reestablishing and establishing the principles,...",Prabhupāda," So how you'll find, if everything is now changed? Where you will get the right information?"
Paramahaṁsa,"That's the problem. That's why there are so many hundreds of branches of Christianity, literally hundreds. So many divisions of Christianity. Some people accept this, some people accept this.",Prabhupāda," Therefore we should advocate thatBhagavad-gītāis not like that. It is coming in the same form as it was taught toArjuna. If you challenge that ""How you know that it has not been changed?"" theācāryasare there. Theācāryasare there, and they are accepting. Therefore it is correct. We have to follow theācāryas.So when we see theācāryashave accepted, then we accept. All theācāryas,Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, before that otherācāryasalso, they accept. They never say that ""This was not in the original scripture. It has been changed."" You don't find any such statement of theācāryas.The best thing, therefore, if you want a religious system,Bhagavad-gītāis coming without any contradiction, change, for the last five thousand years. You accept it. Other scriptures are (unclear), and there are so many doubts, so many interpretations. So, if you want real religious system, this is the scripture spoken directly by God, and accepted by all theācāryas,so take it. If you are really after God, so you take enlightenment from this perfect scripture. If you want truth, it doesn't matter wherefrom it is coming. I must accept the truth."
Paramahaṁsa,"The Christians openly admit that theBiblehas been changed, but they also have a lot of doubt about our scripture.",Prabhupāda," No, even they doubt, the Christian religion is now dead. That we see practically. So many churches are not working. Nobody comes there. Nobody comes."
Paramahaṁsa,"As they have seen that their scripture has been changed, they also have a very strong doubt about our scripture. They say ""Well, yours in even older than ours,"" so somewhere along the line they say it must have been changed.",Prabhupāda," You say, but those who are the followers of the authorities, they do not say. You are outsider. You say it may be. It may not be, but you have no authority. You are simply taking a hypothesis, ""it may be."" But those who actually are following, they do not say. What about this? Whose version is more important? Your or theirs? You are outsider. You are simply suggesting because you had a bad experience. But one who has no such experience, why should he follow your advice?"
Paramahaṁsa,"Actually if anyone looks atBhagavad-gītāAs It Is,presented by yourself, then they can logically see that it is perfect.",Prabhupāda," Yes, we have got our argument, logic, everything. Why should we blindly follow?"
Gaṇeśa,"The results can be seen practically that those who are following theBhagavad-gītāwritten by you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, are giving up these nonsense activities.",Prabhupāda, Letters are posted?
Paramahaṁsa,"No, not yet.",Prabhupāda, How they can deliver if you don't post?
Paramahaṁsa,Well the next time someone goes in. This evening someone can post.,Prabhupāda, There is no letter box?
Gaṇeśa,There's not one close. I can post them tonight.,Prabhupāda," No, night is useless. Nobody is coming to clear."
Gaṇeśa,"Yes, there's one collection at eight o'clock in the night time.",Prabhupāda," Oh, then why not post there? It is six."
Gaṇeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, if the knowledge was handed down by the saintly kings,evaṁparamparā-prāptam[Bg.4.2],how is it that the knowledge was lost?",Prabhupāda," When it was not handed down. Simply understood by speculation. Or if it is not handed down as it is. They might have made some changes. Or they did not hand it down. Suppose I handed it down to you, but if you do not do that, then it is lost. Now theKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is going on in my presence. Now after my deparature, if you do not do this, then it is lost. If you go on as you are doing now, then it will go on. But if you stop... (end)"
Amogha,"There's a pathway up here that goes up... Śrīla Prabhupāda? Sometimes when we are speaking, people say, in the questions they say, ""Why do you say this is a science? It seems that this must be belief. Because science...""",Prabhupāda," Your so-called science is also belief. You believe in one way, we believe in another way. And if you call it science, then it is also science. If you call your belief as science, then why shall I not call my belief as science? Your is also belief. You have never gone to the moon, and you are talking of so many things about moon. That is your belief."
Amogha,But they say with science they can prove so many things.,Prabhupāda," We can also prove. You cannot prove. Just like you say the life is made of chemicals. You prove it. Take chemicals and make a life, then it is true. Otherwise it is a humbug. Why do you say like that, that life is made of chemicals? You cannot prove it."
Amogha,I do not say that life is made of chemicals.,Prabhupāda, They say.
Amogha,They say. Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, these rascals say."
Amogha,But they say they can prove that there are chemicals...,Prabhupāda," You prove it. You take the chemicals and prove-produce life. Why do you talk nonsense? First of all prove. You did not produce a life, even an ant, in the laboratory, and still you say life is a combination of chemicals. Why do you say like that? Challenge them."
Gaṇeśa,"We cannot see souls, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It appears that matter comes from matter, or life comes from matter. We cannot see the soul.",Prabhupāda," You cannot see, but you can perceive. If life comes from matter, then when there is a dead body, put matter and make it alive. Or put chemicals. Chemical is also matter. Make him alive."
Paramahaṁsa,"We made some, um, um...",Prabhupāda," No, no, first of all this is my challenge: that here is a dead body, so bring some chemicals. Just like a motorcar stopped for want of chemical, petrol. So you bring petrol and it will be started. Similarly, you bring some chemical and start it again."
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, that will require some time to find the chemicals.",Prabhupāda, That means you fool. You are talking nonsenses. You do not know what is that chemical. You prove yourself a rascal.
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, we accept that we don't know, but we are trying to learn.",Prabhupāda," Then if you don't know, why do you talk nonsense? First of all you know, then talk. That is science."
Amogha,But the way we built this civilization and technology...,Prabhupāda," It is not civilization. It is animal. You are eating meat, and you are civilized? The tigers eat meat, the dogs eat meat. A human being, why should he eat meat?"
Paramahaṁsa,"But there are so many wonderful things taking place, brain transplants, and so many other things.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. You are not civilized so long you are eating meat. You are dogs and cats and tigers, that's all. The tiger may be a very strong animal, but it is not to be called that he is civilized. Nobody will say the tiger is civilized."
Amogha,"But we have made airplanes and cars, and if we had only waited until we knew, we never could have made it. But by trying...",Prabhupāda, All right. You have made some technical advancement. That does not mean you are civilized. Civilized means the Aryans. They know what is the soul. That is civilization.
Paramahaṁsa; Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"But we have seen in the Eastern countries where the people don't eat meat, they are at the same time very primitive. Very uncivilized, like savages.; They don't have enough food.; No technology, no education.",Prabhupāda," Because you have plundered them for the last two thousand years. You rascals, rogues, you have plundered. You have taken all their money, all their jewels, all their gold, and made British Museum. (laughter) It is due to you. (noise in background) What is the dog? Some dog?"
Amogha,"Oh, that is the siren. You mean the siren?",Prabhupāda," No, no. Some bird."
Amogha,"Oh, yeah. InBhagavad-gītāwe claim that it is a fact scientifically thatKṛṣṇaappeared on earth and so many things. But actually isn't it because we believe that theBhagavad-gītāis true that we think it is scientific? Because we believe it. But someone else would say, ""I don't believe it, so for me it's not scientific.""",Prabhupāda," Why it is not scientific? IfBhagavad-gītāsays,annādbhavantibhūtāni[Bg.3.14],by eating sufficient grains, the living entity become flourished. So, can you deny it?"
Amogha,That must be true.,Prabhupāda," Everything is true. If you think it properly, you'll find it is all true.Bhagavad-gītāsays,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁ: [Bg.4.13] ""By Me, the four divisions of human soceity are made."" The most intelligent class, thebrāhmaṇa,who knows the soul, God, etc., by their character, by their behavior. That isbrāhmaṇaclass. This is the most perfect way of keeping society. Unless there is a class which is very intelligent who know what is God, what is soul, then what is the civilization? Simply motorcar drivers? Is that civilization? Where is thebrāhmaṇa?This is not civilization. Simply some artisans and workers, motorcar drivers, mill workers, where is civilized man, who knows God, who knows soul, who knows how to conduct the human society to the perfection? Where is that man? It is not civilization."
Paramahaṁsa,But we have philosophers and poets.,Prabhupāda," They are all loafer class. They have no information of the soul. They are studying in the dead matter, that's all. Freud and others, Darwin. What do they know?"
Amogha,"There are also so many priests and rabbis, the Pope.",Prabhupāda," But what do they know about the soul, about God? First thing is that there is a supreme authority. You are not independent. So if you do not know who is that supreme authority, what is the value of your knowledge? You have to accept there is a supreme authority, because you are not independent. But you do not know. Just like a rascal, he does not know about the government. What kind of man he is? He's a rascal. A civilized man means he knows what is government, what is the history of government. That is civilized. And if he doesn't know what is government, he is simply living there, he's a third class man. So you have to accept there is a government of the whole universal affair, but you do not know it. Then you are third-class man. You are not human being; you are animal. Animal does not know. This is the proof that you are animal, you are not human being. A human being, at least a class of man there must be—brāhmaṇa.Brāhmajānātiitibrāhmaṇaḥ,one who knows how things are going on. We know that. WeKṛṣṇaconscious people, we know. Therefore we are civilized."
Gaṇeśa,"TheBhagavad-gītāwas written five thousand years ago, so it doesn't pertain to today.",Prabhupāda," No, it was not written. It was there. Then you do not readBhagavad-gītā.Why you are speaking like that? You knowBhagavad-gītā?You have not studiedBhagavad-gītā.That is a disgrace for you. You have readBhagavad-gītā?"
Gaṇeśa,A little.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Amogha,"He says yes, a little.",Prabhupāda," Then you do not know. Why he says thatBhagavad-gītāwas written five thousand years ago? Why do you say like that? You do not know. It was first spoken forty millions of years ago.Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānaham...What kind of realization ofBhagavad-gītā,you do not know? I am accusing you because you are student ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. How you do not know?"
Paramahaṁsa,I think he was posing as a materialist.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. But one who does not know, why is he saying thatBhagavad-gītāwas written five thousand years ago? He does not know. That is my point. If you had known then you would not have said like that, foolishly, thatBhagavad-gītāwas spoken five thousand years ago. It isavyayam,it is eternally there. It is eternally there.Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam[Bg.4.1].Avyayammeans which is never under deterioration. It is eternally existing. That isavyayam.Just likeātmā,soul,avyayam.There is no deterioration. It is there. So forty millions of years ago once it was spoken, but in due course of time it is now lost; therefore I am speaking it again to you. You did not readBhagavad-gītāit is said there? How do you say it was written five thousand years ago? It is already there. It was first spoken forty millions of years ago, now it is lost. The material world is like that. One thing is lost sometimes. Therefore I am speaking to you. And why are you speaking to me? Because you are my devotee. This is the beginning ofBhagavad-gītā.That means only the devotees can understandBhagavad-gītā,and it is always existing, and because it is now lost... Just like we are puttingBhagavad-gītā,why am I stressing so much? It is lost. By the so-called Gandhis and Dr. Radhakrishnan, they have made it lost. Therefore we are stressing. The thing is there. We are simply trying to revive it again. It is not that it is the beginning. No. It is already there. But these rascals have made it lost. People do not understand it, do not follow it, that is the difficulty. So we are trying to revive it again. It is revival of the whole teaching. Permanent teaching. Permanent beneficial instruction. Now it is lost. Which way shall we go?"
Gaṇeśa,"Straight ahead, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is another path.",Prabhupāda, There is another path?
Paramahaṁsa,"Another footpath, yes.",Prabhupāda, This road is nice.
Amogha,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Which way? This way or that way?
Amogha,This way is all right.,Prabhupāda, All right.
Amogha,The sun is this way.,Prabhupāda," Bhagavad-gītāis not that, five thousand years ago, not like that. Just like you cannot say the sun is now coming. It is there. It is there always. You are seeing now. They used to think like that—at night the sun is dead. These rascals. And they are advanced. They used to think that this earth is square. (laughing) And they are advanced. They are changing their opinion daily. That is their scientific knowledge. Why should they change?"
Amogha,"They say this means they are discovering the truth, step by step.",Prabhupāda," That means you do not know the truth. That is a fact. You do not know—simply speculating. You are accepting some spot—this is truth. And after some days, ""No, no, this is not truth,thisis truth."" This is your position."
Paramahaṁsa,Many of the scientific textbooks that were written twenty years ago are all outdated. Can't use them any more.,Prabhupāda," Useless. So this scientific at the present moment, after twenty years they'll be useless. This is your scientific."
Amogha,But at least what we know now is more true than what we knew before. And if we keep trying we'll know more.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that means you are always in ignorance. This means that you are always in ignorance. AndKṛṣṇadoes not say like that.Kṛṣṇasays the same thing I am speaking to you again. That means we are not in ignorance. We may forget something, but the truth is always the same. But you are making, manufacturing, discovering truth. That means you do not know what is truth. You should answer like that. That you are all rascals. You do not know what is truth; therefore you are discovering truth. Truth is never discovered. It is already there. But you do not know what is that truth. That is credit that you are making advance towards truth, but you do not know what is truth. That is a fact. Is it clear? Making discoveries means you do not know what is truth. But it is good credit for you that you are trying to advance. That we agree."
Paramahaṁsa,So eventually if we keep advancing like this we'll understand the truth.,Prabhupāda, No you'll never advance. Your advance is so slow and foolish that you cannot.
Amogha,But some Indian history professors say...,Prabhupāda," We are not talking of Indian history, we are talking on the truth. We never say it is Indian truth."
Amogha,"ButBhagavad-gītāhas been presented in so many ways also, and now we are saying it is another way.",Prabhupāda," ThereforeKṛṣṇasays that ""I am showing you the way how to understandBhagavad-gītā.You have to accept that."" Not so many ways. Only that way. That I have explained in the Preface, that when you have to take a medicine, you have to take the direction:dose, such and such. Not that so many ways doses are prescribed. According to the prescription you have to take. Otherwise you will waste your time. Now they have wasted so many plates. What is the value of this? (referring to memorial plates on trees.)"
Amogha,Bhūtejya.,Prabhupāda," What benefit is there? A soldier has died. So what is the use of having a tree, having a plate?"
Amogha,This will make us remember how much our countrymen...,Prabhupāda, What benefit is there by remembering?
Paramahaṁsa,Well the family feels honored that there is a tree here for a son of their's.,Prabhupāda, What benefit do they derive?
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, they can come and see it.",Prabhupāda, Do they think that man who has died is still there?
Amogha,"Next time when there is a war, then they will feel more inclined to fight, knowing that there may be a tree for them.",Prabhupāda," It means, this is government deceiving. The man is not there. And even if he is there, suppose the soldier after dying for his country has become a tree, is it a very good reward? (laughter) How foolishly they are thinking. We have to point out their foolishness. That is our business. They are working very hard, undoubtedly, but they are working foolishly.Śramaevahikevalam[SB1.2.8].The result is simply they are becoming tired. That's all. Because they are not working intelligently, like monkey, he is busy all day. What is the value of your busy? You'll find the monkey is never sitting idle. He's always busy, ""eḥ, eh, eh."" (imitating monkey) So what is the result of that busyness? He's a monkey. And they claim to be coming from monkey, these rascals. So we can see that your monkey's quality is already there. (laughter) You have not improved more than monkey, because you are working uselessly. They are theorizing that they have come from monkey, and as soon as you say that you are monkey, they become angry. Just see. They are claiming that we are coming from monkey. And if you say you are monkey, no better than monkey, then they are angry. Just see."
Paramahaṁsa,That's because we've advanced from the monkey stage up to the human stage.,Prabhupāda," You have not advanced. If you are uselessly working, then you are monkey. Monkey is busy, but useless. There is no value. What is the value of your working? You cannot make a solution of the problem that you are dying. Then what is the use of your working? You do not like to die. Why you are dying? You are keeping memory of him because you wanted that he should not have died. That is your desire. You do not like to die. So where is the solution of your death? You might open many hospitals, but where is the solution of disease, that there should be no more disease? That you cannot do. Therefore your so-called scientific research, working hard day and night, is all monkeys' business. Useless."
Paramahaṁsa,But we are seeing that even the spiritualists get old and die also.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. We are not talking of this body. We are talking of the soul. We say that soul transmigrates. So, instead of transmigrating to another this perishable body, we are transmigrating to the eternal body. That is our business. We are making solution. But you do not know. You are simply working like monkey, uselessly."
Paramahaṁsa,But we haven't seen that anyone has got...,Prabhupāda," How you can see? You cannot see. You do not believe in transmigration. So how can you see?Paśyantijñāna-cakṣuṣā.When you will have the eyes to see—knowledge—then you'll see. Now you are monkey, how you can see? A monkey cannot see.Paśyantijñānacakṣuṣa.Just like our men in India, they know I have come to Australia. But he's not seeing by his eyes. He knows the arrangement was made, they purchased ticket, and they went to the airport. And they are confident. They are sending letters here. Has he come with me to see? How he knows? That I have come here, how he knows? He has not seen that I have come here. But how he knows?"
Gaṇeśa,By hearing.,Prabhupāda, That means there are other sources of understanding—not only the eyes. The rascals do not know. They want tosee.
Paramahaṁsa,Of course a person can never be completely sure...,Prabhupāda," Therefore,jñānacakṣuṣa.You can see with knowledge how this man is being transferred to the eternal life. But you have no such knowledge! You are monkey. A monkey cannot see, a monkey cannot understand. Suppose there is a dog at my house. He does not understand how I have come here, because he has no knowledge. So seeing means knowledge. Seeing, not the eyes. He wants to see by the eyes. He's a monkey. That's all. He's a dog."
Paramahaṁsa,"But first we have to believe it, and then we can see it?",Prabhupāda," It is not the question of belief. It is a fact. It is a fact in this way, thatKṛṣṇasays,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaiti [Bg.4.9]—that's all. You have to see throughKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais perfect.Kṛṣṇasays that a such and such person devotee, after giving up this body, he does not accept. That is seeing.Kṛṣṇasays and you see. Just like you believe me. A child believes the father. Similarly, if the authority is there, then you see by his word, that's all. That is knowledge. Seeing by perfect knowledge—that is seeing. Not by endeavoring with these imperfect senses. That is not knowledge."
Paramahaṁsa,But in this modern age...,Prabhupāda," Modern age means all rascals and fools. So we haven't got to follow the rascals and fools. You have to follow the most perfect,Kṛṣṇa."
Paramahaṁsa,The problem is that everyone is cheating. Everyone is presenting some knowledge of this or that...,Prabhupāda," Therefore we have acceptedKṛṣṇa, who will not cheat. You are cheater, therefore you are believing cheaters. We do not cheat, and we accept a person who does not cheat. That is the difference between you and me."
Gaṇeśa,"But we were all cheaters before we came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So how is it that we're not accepting a cheater? How is it that we cheaters have accepted some knowledge from you?",Prabhupāda," Yes, because you are speaking whatKṛṣṇasaid. He is not cheater. He is God. I am talking to you, but not my own knowledge. I am presenting to you whatKṛṣṇasaid. That's all. Therefore I am not cheater. I might have been a cheater, but since I am talking only the words ofKṛṣṇa, since then I am not cheater.Kṛṣṇasays,vedāhaṁ samatītāni[Bg.7.26],""I know past, present and future."" Therefore He is not cheater. But so far we are concerned, we do not know what was the past and what is future. And we do not know perfectly the present also. And if we speak something, then we are cheater. That is cheating. OurKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is that don't hear the cheaters and don't try to cheat others. Be honest, and hear from the authority. This isKṛṣṇa. OurKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is, that don't hear the cheaters and don't try to cheat others. Be honest and hear from the authorities. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Amogha,"Śrīla Prabhupāda? Why is it that some people, when they hear aboutKṛṣṇaconsciousness, they take it, and some do not. And still, after that, some of those who take it, they stay, and some who take it take it for some time and then they fail?",Prabhupāda," That is fortunate and unfortunate. Just like one inherits father's property. Many millions of dollars, and he has become a poor man by his misusing the money. Like that. He is unfortunate. He got the money, but he could not utilize it."
Jayadharma,Does fortune mean it's the mercy ofKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa's mercy is always there. It is your misuse of free will. You are given the opportunity—that is fortune. But you do not accept the fortune. That is your misfortune. That is stated in theCaitanya-caritāmṛita.LordCaitanyasaid,eirūpebrahmāṇḍabhramitekonabhāgyavānjīva[Cc.Madhya19.151].Kono—some fortunate man can accept it. Because mostly they are unfortunate. Just see, throughout the whole of Europe and America we are making propaganda. How many students have come? A very insignificant number, although they have come. They are fortunate."
Amogha,"Sometimes we see that a devotee may be very sincere, but at the same time he becomes weak somehow, and he falls down.",Prabhupāda," Even if he falls down, still he is fortunate, because the injection is there. It will act, some day or another. Still he is fortunate. As fortunate man he took it, but he fell down. That does not mean he's unfortunate. Still he's fortunate, because the poison is already there. It will develop. That is calledajñātasukṛti.Therefore he is not loser. He continues to be fortunate. It will take some time."
Amogha,So he became weak because he misused his individual will.,Prabhupāda," He misused the instruction of his spiritual master. Therefore he became unfortunate, or he fell down. (pause) This is botanical garden?"
Amogha,"The sign says parking for botanic gardens. But I'm not acquainted with it. (pause) I don't know. It says, ""Cetenniary. August 22, 1947."" Perhaps its name is on the other side. (pause) Is there going to be a world war very soon? We heard there would be.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,Then it will be a very different situation for preaching.,Prabhupāda, Your preaching will not be stopped. It will go on. (pause)
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa; Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"He's bringing the car. He went back. He'll bring it around. (reading sign) ""The Tree Society originated the idea of placing thiskadilog in King's Park. The log, normally destined for milling, was provided and brought by Booning Brothers P.T. Limited from their Darling River sawmilling area. The following transporting and placing in position of this great log from over 200 miles from the depths of the forest, with each of the three sections borne on a 200 horsepower motor truck, was a major engineering feat and a tribute to the spirit of western Australian timber men. With the approval and assistance of the King's Park board, the actual placing of the log in King's Park by 25 June, 1958, was contributed to by Hume Pipe Co., Aaron Brothers B.P. Australia Ltd, the Forests Department and other government departments. The completion of the project was a fine example of community effort.""; It weighs a hundred and ten tons. And it's 363 years old, this log. They say it grew that long. In America we have some redwood trees in California they say are many thousands of years old.; This is a type of eucalyptus?; It saysEucalyptus diversicol.",Prabhupāda," Bhāgavatasays,kiṁtaromanajīvanti.You want to prolong your life. The trees—they do not prolong their life? So if you prolong your life, does it mean that you are better than a tree?Kimtaromanajīvanti.If prolonging life is your mission, the trees automatically do that without any scientific knowledge. Then what is the value of your science?Kimtaromanajīvanti.Do they not live for thousands of years? What is the value of such living? If the tree is living, standing for 10,000 years, then what is the value of this 10,000 years? So if you live like a tree, without any benefit, then what is the value of your life?"
Jayadharma,Some people say that trees may be very happy. How do we know?,Prabhupāda," If you want to become happy like that, be. Stand up. Stand up on the bench and laugh—be happy. (laughter)"
Amogha,But they say we are humans; we can enjoy.,Prabhupāda, What enjoy?
Amogha,"Television, cinema, dancing...",Prabhupāda," Yes, the dogs also dance and enjoy. The monkeys also dance and enjoy."
Paramahaṁsa,"But these animals, they're not intelligent enough to enjoy the higher...",Prabhupāda," They are intelligent. Otherwise when the dog jumps here, and goes to one man and come here-he's enjoying. It is enjoyment. So you are doing like that."
Amogha,But we cook very nice food to eat.,Prabhupāda," They also eat, according to their taste. The hogs, they eat stool and they enjoy it. So, according to our calculation you are eating stool—the meat. And you are thinking you are enjoying, as the hog's thinking, that's all. It is a question of standard of enjoyment. Otherwise, enjoyment is there in every living sphere. (In car)"
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa; Amogha,"It sounds very nice. If we chantHareKṛṣṇawe can feel unlimited pleasure.; It sounds too simple to be true.; But maybe we can in addition to this unlimited pleasure, just to make sure we don't lose out on anything, maybe we can also enjoy all these other pleasures.",Prabhupāda," Yes, you (indistinct) motorcar and chant. You are working hard like an ass to get these motorcars. You'll get these by chanting."
Gaṇeśa,"Sometimes they say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if everybody chantsHareKṛṣṇa, what shape would the world be in?",Prabhupāda," They would get everything, and without any labor. Just see our example."
Amogha,But they say that the only reason you are...HareKṛṣṇamovement is existing is because we are working and giving you the money.,Prabhupāda," You must work. Because we are superior, you must work under us. (laughter) That will give you actually happiness. (indistinct) That is your duty. You are not carrying out your duty, then you will suffer. You work under our direction, you'll be happy."
Amogha,"Then they say that every religion says the same thing, that if you follow them, then you will be happy. But they are all teaching differently. So...",Prabhupāda, That's all right. Now try this. This is the latest. (laughter) You are after latest. This is the latest.
Jayadharma,"Sometimes people may say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we're just trying to introduce the oldcastesystem from India that never worked anyway.",Prabhupāda," Thatcastesystem is already there. We are also..., we have got poor class, rich class. The Communists, they have also worker class, manager class, although the Communists against class system. But I have seen, they have made this classification: worker class, manager class. Why do you make this? That is efficiency. Leader class, follower class. Otherwise there will be chaos. This is natural."
Amogha,The divisions of work are naturally there. You can't avoid them.,Prabhupāda," Even in your body there is class. The head class, the arm class, the belly class, the leg class. They are working differently for benefit of the whole body. That is natural. If you avoid and if you simply keep the leg, then it will be chaotic condition. Or even if you keep the head only, that will not stand. There must be four. That is natural. That is the Vedicmantrait is said—you are reading the other day—thebrāhmaṇas,they came out of the mouth. Thekṣatriyas,they came out of the arms. Thevaiśyas,they came out of the belt. And theśūdras,they came out of the legs. This ismantra.How you can avoid it?Kṛṣṇasays, ""It is My creation. How you can avoid it?"" You cannot avoid anything which is created byKṛṣṇa. Just like sunshine. It is created byKṛṣṇa. You cannot say, ""No, no. I don't want sunshine."" That is foolishness. If you want to avoid, then you'll suffer. The sunshine is there, and if you go into the dark place, and cover yourself, then the sunshine is outside, that's all. The sun may not suffer—you'll suffer. Similarly,Kṛṣṇasays that ""Thiscastesystem is created by Me."" If you don't accept it, then you'll suffer.Kṛṣṇawill not suffer. (leaves car) ...introducing thecastesystem, we are introducing a system which, you follow, you'll be happy. Notcastesystem.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] (in room:)"
Jayadharma,They say in India that thecastesystem apparently is not working.,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Amogha,Shall I answer?,Prabhupāda, Mm.
Amogha,"But at present thecastesystem in India isn't actually representative of the originalvarṇāśramadharmasystem. The original system was a cooperation, organized cooperation between four kinds of men which are naturally there in society. Just like now we can see that some people are working as laborers, some people are working as merchants, and some people politicians and lawyers, some are teachers. Originally they were organized so that the priests, or priestly order, were benefiting everyone by their teaching. And so that they could fully concentrate on that, they were not engaged in working for food and money. But what happened in this age, was that the highercastebecame fallen, and they misused their high position, and instead of helping everyone by their teaching, they misused the position, or exploited the position, simply for selfish ends, so there became a conflict between the...",Prabhupāda, Vested interest.
Amogha,"Vested interest. Yes. So then there was conflict between the lower and the higher and it broke down. So what we're teaching is not actually thecastesystem as it is now or it was recently, but...",Prabhupāda," You have alsocastesystem in the Western countries. You are not withoutcastesystem. There is a priestly class. So there are politicians, there are industrialists, merchants, and ordinary laborer. Where is...? How you can say there is nocastesystem in your country?"
Jayadharma,"But there may be the clergymen and the mercantile class and the soldiers and the laborers, in this particular society, but this society is breaking away from that because they are not recognizing the clergy class of men because nobody is going to church, nor is anybody giving any money to the church these days. This is why many churches...",Prabhupāda," No, no. First of all think, that you say that your charge is ""They are introducingcastesystem."" But theHinducastesystem is already there. How do you say that I am introducing? That is my point."
Jayadharma,That is my foolishness.,Prabhupāda," (laughing lightly) You cannot say that I have introduced it. It is already there. As it is there in India, it is also everywhere. It may be under different names. The four classes are already there, everywhere. The... Even in Muslim, they have also got the (indistinct), what is called,mohallas,priestly class. They have got. We are introducing the systematiccastesystem, butcastesystem is already there, everywhere. Maybe under different names. And it is necessary. Thecastesystem is there as a matter of necessity. You cannot abolish it. But it is now existing in a deformed manner. People should be systematic and organized. That we are trying to. Not that a new thing we are trying to introduce. It is already there. Our proposition is that ""You priestly class, you must act exactly as a priest-ideal priest. You are a drunkard, you are woman-hunter, you are doing everything nonsense, and at the same time you are passing on as priest—this should be stopped."" This should be stopped. The priestly class, or thebrāhmaṇas,they should be trained up to become truthful, how to control mind, how to control senses, and tolerant, and very learned, knowing God also—these things are required. They should be the first-class, ideal men. Similarly, thekṣatriyas,they must be fearless; they must be very boldly, face fighting the enemies; they must have the capacity to govern nicely so that people will not have any complaint against the government. In this way they should be trained up. And the mercantile class of man, they should produce enough food grains, not motor tires. That isśūdra'sbusiness—artisans—that isśūdra.Thevaiśyas'business is first to see that in the country there is enough food for eating—both for the human being and the animals. The human being should not complain that there is no sufficient food grains, therefore they're eating flesh. No. Flesh is not for human being. They should live on food grains. Just likedahl. Dahlis as good as meat. It is from food grain. And there is sufficient varieties ofdahlthey can eat. They can make so many preparations, palatable preparations. Why are the prices of food grains increasing? Because there is shortage. If there is enough food, the price will automatically decrease, because everyone want to sell. So, the price will decrease, naturally. It will be so lavishly available that you can give food grains even to the animals, like cows and goats and other so many animals. Let them eat. That is the business of thevaiśyaman. Andgo-rakṣya.Another business is to protect the cows, and to give them food nicely so the cows will give enough milk. And from milk, you know, so many nice preparations, all full of vitamins. So why they should be killed? You are killing; the blood is not utilized, you are taking the flesh. But flesh is transformation of the blood. And milk is also transformation of the blood. So if you take, just likechanna,it is as good as flesh. By taste, by benefit—as good as. So why if youcantake the flesh and blood in a human way-blood is transformed into milk, and from milk there are so many good preparations-ghee, yoghurt,burfi,channa,so many preparations are available. Thispanir,channa,and let the animal live peacefully. Why are you cutting his throat? You require some benefit from the animal. Take this benefit. Why should you kill? If he can live and give better service, then why shall I try to kill? What is this human civilization? Is that human civilization, that I am taking service from you, and I am cutting your throat? Is that humanity? What is the answer?"
Jayadharma,"No, it's animal civilization.",Prabhupāda," Anyone who takes milk... Everyone takes milk. The cow is the mother. Mother gives milk. And mother, when she cannot supply milk, mother should be cut up. Is that a very good philosophy? Is it human philosophy? What is the answer? But if you say that somebody wants to, say in your country majority they want to eat meat. So, if you put that argument, then you can eat some lower animals. You can eat the pigs. You are eating also, pigs. Not in a massive scale. Massive scale—if you are Christian you should follow your religious scripture: ""Thou shall not kill!"" This should be the principle. But if you are arākṣasa,if you want to eat meat, then at least don't kill the cows. You can eat other, insignificant animals. You are eating also. You are eating everything. Except the moving cars, you are eating all the moving animals. The car also moves, but you cannot eat. Otherwise you are killing everything. You have become so civilized rascal that your business is to kill other animals and eat. You are so civilized. You are still in the crude form of human being, just like in the jungles, the aborigines, the Africans, they do not know how to develop civilization—crude methods, eating the animals. That also, they are not so uncivilized that they keep slaughterhouses. You are so uncivilized that you are keeping slaughterhouses, regularly. These Africans and other jungle people they eat meat, but they directly kill. They have no such civilization as to maintain a slaughterhouse. The tigers eat meat, but they do not keep a slaughterhouse. And you are civilized. You are keeping slaughterhouse. Why should you keep? The government shouldn't allow you to keep slaughterhouses. If anyone wants to eat meat, let them eat like tigers and others. Individually, kill one animal—a lower animal, not cows. This should be the government law. You can kill one insignificant animal, like pigs or goats. It has not very much use. You kill it in your home, before your children and family, and eat. THe government may not have any objection. But why should you maintain slaughterhouses? So the agriculturist and the mercantile men, they should produce enough food, give protection to the cows, and if there is excess, sell it. Where there is not enough food grain produced you can make business. That is the instruction given inBhagavad-gītā,kṛṣi-go-rakṣyavāṇijyam[Bg.18.44].That is really needed. Nobody is interested. Everyone comes to the city, the mercantile class. They are doing business, big, big skyscraper building, and they have artificial money, paper. And instead of eating food grains they are maintaining slaughterhouses. This is not good civilization.HareKṛṣṇa. (end)"
Amogha,"What are the stars exactly, they're other planets or...?",Prabhupāda," They're planets, (indistinct) planets."
Amogha,Are they self-luminating like the moon?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Like that. That is stated inBhagavad-gītā,nakṣatrāṇāmahaṁśaśi."
Amogha,"Ah, ""Of luminaries, I am the moon.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha,Very soon the United States is sending up one rocket and Russia is sending up another rocket and they are joining in space and they think this is progress. They'll join together up there. They hope someday they'll be able to stay in a station like that and then go out to some planet.,Prabhupāda," They could not mix in this planet, they are going to mix in another planet."
Srutakirti,They'll probably have some argument in outer space. The astronauts will get into a fight.,Prabhupāda," The rascal could not compromise here, they're going in the sky. All mental concoction."
Gaṇeśa,They actually have never got to the moon.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Amogha,He says did they actually get to the moon or not?,Prabhupāda," That I am doubtful. Always. [break] ...doubt always. They have... They might have gone... Mostly, most probably they have not gone. Simply propaganda. But even they have gone, not to moon. Maybe theRahuplanet. Or there are so many other planets."
Amogha,Is thatRahuplanet closer than the moon to the earth?,Prabhupāda," Rahuplanet orbit is in between moon and sun. So when it comes in between moon and sun there is eclipse. At night it is eclipse in the moon, and daytime it is eclipse in the sun."
Amogha,They used to think that because there is overpopulation we will go to another planet and then begin living there.,Prabhupāda," No question of overpopulation. There are so many land. You do not know how to live. There is no question of overpopulation. You want to live like cats and dogs. Therefore you fight; there is scarcity. If you live properly, there is no question of scarcity. [break] Otherwise it is perfect. Everything is perfect. There is no question of inconvenience. You live according to the direction ofBhagavad-gītā;there is no question of scarcity, inconvenience, overpopulation. Everything is made."
Amogha,People just take it for granted that...,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Amogha,"Due to the propaganda, people take it for granted, ""Yes, there is overpopulation. Yes, there is lack of food. There is starvation, this and that.""",Prabhupāda," Because they cannot manage, so they give some other cause."
Amogha,Yeah. They blame it on nature.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Amogha; Paramahaṁsa,"But they don't know that nature's arrangement is perfect.; They spend billions of dollars to try to go in space, but they don't spend that money for food.",Prabhupāda," Jaya,thank you,jaya.[break]"
Devotee (1),"In theBhagavad-gītāKṛṣṇasays He creates the fourvarṇasandāśramas,so these four classes of men are everywhere. I was just wondering if it is correct to say that each man only finds his satisfaction performing a particular type of work according to his mode of nature? Is that correct?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Devotee (1),"For instance, a man who is in the mode of passion like akṣatriya,he only finds satisfaction when he's engaged in warfare or administrative work. Similarly so with avaiśyaor aśūdra...",Prabhupāda," Yes. I think it is... Maybe it is described in Seventeenth Chapter. According to our free will, we are associating with certain type of the modes of material nature, and then we become subjected to that material modes. The same example: you infect some disease, contamination, and you gain the result of it. So our endeavor should be how to raise ourself to the first, to thesattva-guṇa.That we can do. And then transcendsattva-guṇaand reach the spiritual platform. Everyone is trying to improve his position, but they do not know what is meant by improvement. Improvement means mostly they are intamo-guṇa,ignorance. So rise fromtamo-guṇatorajo-guṇa,rajo-guṇatosattva-guṇa,and thensattva-guṇato transcendence. That is improvement. So generally, people are suffering on account of association withtamo-guṇaandrajo-guṇa,whole material world, mostlytamo-guṇaand few of them inrajo-guṇa.The symptoms ofrajo-guṇaandtamo-guṇaare lust and greediness. Just like yesterday you told me the students are talking about homosex. That meanstamo-guṇa,that the education-students, they are discussing about homosex. That meanstamo-guṇa,lusty desires, very prominent, and how to fulfill, by homosex or sex with woman. This is their subject matter,kāma.So everyone in this material world infected with thistamo-guṇa,all lusty desires, in various ways, varieties. And some of them inrajo-guṇa-politics and improvement of material condition. So we have to cut down thistamo-guṇaandrajo-guṇa,come to thesattva-guṇa.Then he'll not be disturbed by these lusty desires and greediness. Then he'll be happy.Sthita-sattveprasīdati.When he comes to thesattva-guṇa,now he has to make further progress,sattva-guṇa.And the progress means, being situated insattva-guṇaif he advances in devotional service,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, then he surpasses all the material qualities. That is perfection of life."
