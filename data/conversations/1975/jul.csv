Brahmānanda,"One friend of the temple, one man, he has purchased it at a very high price, and he has lent it for your stay. These glasses are bulletproof.

Brahmānanda,"He has in Florida, Key Biscayne. He had two homes, one in Florida, one in California. But now he's staying in Florida. Recently he went to New York and testified before a committee. It's the first time that he has spoken publicly since his...",Prabhupāda, What is that committee?
Brahmānanda,They were investigating the Watergate.,Prabhupāda," Oh. Oh, he had to present himself."
Brahmānanda,Yes. It's the first time any ex-chief executive has ever testified.,Prabhupāda, So he is not out of danger.
Brahmānanda,"Well, they're still investigating the whole thing.",Prabhupāda," But I heard that he made a condition that he will no more be bothered. On this condition, he agreed to resign. [break] ...India the trouble is dissention between IndiraGandhiandJayaPrakashNārāyaṇa. So thatJayaPrakashNārāyaṇais fasting, I have heard."
Brahmānanda,That gentleman said. The doctor said. He's seventy-nine years of age.,Prabhupāda, Seventy-nine?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yes. Is there any danger to us from her arresting so many people?,Prabhupāda, No.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Now she has clearly indicated that she is like a dictator. Otherwise how could she arrest...,Prabhupāda, So both of them are in distressed condition. I am thinking of writing them aboutBhagavad-gītā.Do you think it is advised? They can...
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I think Nixon would be more inclined to read it than Mrs.Gandhi. Because she already has rejectedHinduculture.,Prabhupāda, Who?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Gandhi. I mean, she always turns towards the Muslims more.",Prabhupāda," No, no, she hasguru. And she is going occasionally to Anandamayi."
Brahmānanda,"Yeah, thatguruhas spoken highly of our movement. In Germany there was an interview of him in one German magazine, and he was asked about all different types of groups. And most of the groups he criticized, but our group he gave his recommendation, theHareKṛṣṇamovement.",Prabhupāda, What did he say?
Brahmānanda,"I don't remember exactly, but he stressed the importance of the chanting of themahā-mantra.He said ""It is an important means for God realization, and by doing this, one can achieve love of God, and they are spreading this all over the world.""",Prabhupāda," So what do you think? Shall I write? Hm? I have made a draft of letter this night. So you come and see. Let us take a chance. We want actually good for everyone. And this is the only medicine,HareKṛṣṇamantra.For any problem.Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.People are suffering. If herguruhas opined like that, then she may take some attention. Then it appears thatguruis to some extent nice."
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, She gave interview to our men.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I saw her twice.,Prabhupāda," Oh, you saw? How did (s)he talk with you?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,She was very respectful. And she wished our movement well.,Prabhupāda, Ācchā?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"She said that she had difficulty to take an active part, because then she would have to take an active part in all such movements.",Prabhupāda, Hmm. That's it. That is the difficulty. She said frankly.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yes. Because we asked her to attend the cornerstone ceremony at Māyāpur.,Prabhupāda," So, shall we take a chance?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I think it might be nice.,Prabhupāda," All right. Then write two registered letters, one toJayaPrakashNarayana... [break] ...astrologer, who was telling me?"
Brahmānanda; Bhāvānanda,"Oh,BhāvānandaMahārāja, he knows. The astrologer in Māyāpur?; Oh, Mr... In Svarūp Gañj there's one big astrologer. So he saw your photograph, and he said, ""This is the face of the most powerful spiritual personality on the planet.""",Prabhupāda, (laughs)HareKṛṣṇa.
Brahmānanda; Bhāvānanda; Devotees,"Then what else?; Then he said that ""I can tell from his face that he can make a house in which the whole world can live peacefully.""; JayaPrabhupāda!",Prabhupāda, At least I desire so. [break] Where your preaching was going on?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"We were preaching in Berkeley, California. Our other parties are spread out all over the country. One party is in Massachusetts, another party is in the South, southern United States.",Prabhupāda, Where in Massachusetts?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Amherst area. Then another party is in Michigan, another party in Illinois, another party is in Washington, in the state of Washington. There's a couple of others.",Prabhupāda, So his parties are working more. And book selling is going on?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Oh, yeah. This past month we sold nearly five thousand big books.",Prabhupāda, Oh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"And about 120,000Back to Godheads.",Prabhupāda," So you are surpassing, what is his name?"
Devotees; TamālaKṛṣṇa; Viṣṇujana,"TripurāriMahārāja. (Prabhupāda laughs); No, we're just following in his footsteps. [break]; ...a bus now, so he's going to compete by making new devotees and expanding his ranks. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...competition amongst thegopīs,who can satisfyKṛṣṇamore. In the spiritual world there is also competition. [break] ...two parties, one, Rādhārāṇī's party, and one, Candravāli's party. (Car horn honks) Come on. (laughs)"
Brahmānanda,They were saluting us.,Prabhupāda, Outsider?
Brahmānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. [break]; When we distribute these books, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we think that it is you who are distributing them, that they are your books, and we are simply assisting to offer them to people. It is actually you who are doing all the preaching.",Prabhupāda," It is Kṛṣṇa's book, we are all servants, engaged. [break] (laughing) Here your parents accusing me, and in India thecastebrāhmaṇasaccusing me. My standing... I do not know what is my standing. Your parents are accusing me, ""This rascal, converting our sons to become mendicant without any material enjoyment."" And there, ""This rascal is giving sacred thread to themlecchasandyavanas."" (Still laughing)"
Viṣṇujana,"Is that why you keep traveling, Prabhupāda, so they won't catch you?",Prabhupāda," NāradaMuniwas accused byPrajāpatiDakṣathat ""You are traveling in the dress of asādhu,but you are the most sinful man. You have turned my sons in the renounced order of life to become beggar, without any advancement, without any enjoyment."" So that accusation is always there, beginning fromNāradaMunidown to us. Some parents came to demonstrate?"
Brahmānanda; Bhāvānanda,"In Los Angeles, yes. I understand they've demonstrated before, someone was saying? They had placards, and they were marching.; In Laguna Beach they also.",Prabhupāda, Therefore Dr. Judah has said...
Brahmānanda,"He has dedicated his book, ""To the parents and to the devotees.""",Prabhupāda, He has tried to pacify the parents.
Brahmānanda,Yes. Another parent is coming to see you today.,Prabhupāda," Oh, to accuse me? (laughter)"
Brahmānanda,"No, her son said she is very favorable. She's the mother ofParīkṣit.",Prabhupāda," Your mother was very angry upon us. (laughter) You know that? When she came to see me, I told, ""Mrs. Bruce, can you give me some money?"" (laughing) (Imitating angry woman's voice:) ""I have given you two sons!"" (laughter) She was very angry. ""Still you want money?"" (laughter) ""And that's all right."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa,You asked them to bow down to her?,Prabhupāda," No, I asked him to bow down to your mother."
Brahmānanda,"Yes, at initiation.",Prabhupāda, After initiation.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Did she like...,Prabhupāda," I gave her proper respect. Mother, after all, she is. She is fortunate mother. She has produced such nice sons. And I offered her respect, yes. Any of your mother and father, they are all very fortunate. And you are doing... giving the best service to your family. Our Nitāi's mother came. She looked very nice lady, yes. I think you are the first child."
Nitāi,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Therefore she looks young, not very old. Within forty?"
Nitāi,"Over forty, I think. Within fifty.",Prabhupāda, Oh. But she looks younger. And your grandmother?
Nitāi,She is eighty.,Prabhupāda," Oh. [break] ...DakṣaaccusedNāradathat ""My sons were not out of the three kinds of debts."" One debt is debtor to the saintly sages. Just like we are readingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,we are indebted to Vyāsadeva. He has given such literature, and we are taking advantage of it. As such, especially thebrāhmaṇas,they have got indebtedness to big sages and saintly person. They receive knowledge from them. And they are indebtor to the demigods. Therefore they have to performyajñas.And they are indebtor to their father because the father has brought them to this world. So in this way, especially abrāhmaṇais indebted to demigods, the past sages, and the father. So the indebtedness to the sages is performed by becomingbrahmacārī,and to the demigods by offering sacrifices, and to the father by begetting children, to continue the progeny. SoNāradaMuniwas accused that ""You keep them indebted to these principles, so how they can be liberated? Simply by dressing like you, (laughs) a mendicant?"" Accusing. But perhaps he did not know. There is another version in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,"
Brahmānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,This tree? [break]; Sometimes when we're readingBhāgavatamabout theprajāpatis...They are such exalted persons.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. They are no ordinary person."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yet sometimes they behave in such a way that is...,Prabhupāda," That is... After all, they are living entity, conditioned. They are also conditioned. They are not liberated."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,They're not pure devotees.,Prabhupāda," No. They want enjoyment, material."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Still, they're entrusted with very big posts.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Satsvarūpa,"But LordBrahmā, he's aprajāpati.",Prabhupāda, He is the chiefprajāpati.
Satsvarūpa,Isn't he a pure devotee?,Prabhupāda, No.
Satsvarūpa,And yet he composed theBrahma-saṁhitā.,Prabhupāda," Yes, he is devotee, not to the topmost extent."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Sometimes we hear that LordBrahmāincarnated as ṬhākuraHaridāsa.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Satsvarūpa,"Sometimes devotees say, ""Then how come he's the head of oursampradāyaif he's not a pure devotee?""",Prabhupāda," It doesn't require. He is a devotee. That's all right. There are grades of devotee, but on the whole, a devotee is very exalted person. Just likegopīs.Nobody can be compared with thegopīs.There are so many grades of devotees, but they are ultimate. And amongst thegopīs,Rādhārāṇī. So there is no comparison, no more... EvenKṛṣṇais defeated there.KṛṣṇabecameCaitanyaMahāprabhuto understand the devotion of Rādhārāṇī. That isCaitanyaMahāprabhu. [break] (About something by the path:) ...queen. Elizabeth? No. Queen or king?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda; Harikeśa; Satsvarūpa,Is there a plaque there?; It's a symbol for something.; They usually make justice to be like that. [break]; Allegorical.,Prabhupāda, Allegorical?
Satsvarūpa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"It's not a historial person. One lady represents learning, another... They represent different things.; All, women. [break]",Prabhupāda, ...imperson.
Brahmānanda,"Cupid is there, and it is marked ""love.""",Prabhupāda," Oh. [break] (ToHarikeśa, who has been coughing throughout:) ...not taking any medicine?"
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda, This continuing is not good.
Harikeśa,"I stopped eating anything but fruit, and that's what I did. [break]",Prabhupāda, ...examined your chest?
Harikeśa,No.,Prabhupāda," Oh, you should examine your chest. Some congestion in the lungs. [break]"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, around our society now there are many devotees who are following different kinds of diets. They read some book and they get some idea. They follow...",Prabhupāda, This is not good.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,And one of the things I see about the unique feature of all the diets that they have in common is that the devotees more or less stop taking theprasādamwhich is offered to the Deity.,Prabhupāda, This is not good. [break]
TamālaKṛṣṇa,It seems to me that one of the important aspects ofbhakti-yogais to depend uponKṛṣṇafor one's maintenance.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"So whatever is offered to the Deity, one should accept.",Prabhupāda, Theprasādamis not suitable?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Well it is standardprasādam. Capatis,rice,dahl, subji,fruits.",Prabhupāda, So why they do not like?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Well, they are reading these books...",Prabhupāda, And becoming influenced.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, This is nonsense. This should be stopped.
Sudāmā,"A lot of devotees, they take these fasting for twenty days, thirty days, fasting.",Prabhupāda, That means they are manufacturing their own way of life. That's not good.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"One of our best devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he recently left our association. And one of the... I know the biggest reason is that he was fasting completely from almost all foods for thirty days.",Prabhupāda," But fasting is good. If one can fast, that is good. That istapasya."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. But see, they read these books in addition.",Prabhupāda," Fasting is not bad. If one can fast, that is very good."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Total fast, you mean?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yadubara,I remember in Los Angeles...,Prabhupāda, That is great austerity.
Yadubara; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that we should not fast more than one day.; Yeah, I wanted to point out to you that the results...",Prabhupāda," No, artificial... Just likeRaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī, he was fasting, but he was not weak. That fasting. And he who will fast artificially and become weak, ""I cannot work,"" that is not required. That is calledmarkaṭa-vairāgya.If you fast and at the same time you do not become weak, then that is recommended. And after fasting you cannot do a flat, fall flat, then what is the use of fasting?RaghunāthadāsaGosvāmī was fasting, but he was taking thrice bathing and offering obeisances hundred times. His regular activities was not stopped. And he was taking every alternate day a little quantity of butter. That's all."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,So we cannot imitate his position.,Prabhupāda, That is not possible. We have to work.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. One of the important things about takingprasādamis that all the devotees sit together. It is actually a very spiritual activity. Just like inCaitanya-caritāmṛta,the feasts...",Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. That is recommended, that we are following. But now it is not following?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Well, I have to say frankly, I have seen now that in many... I don't want to get into mentioning any names, but some devotees are preaching this.",Prabhupāda," Preaching? Who is that nonsense, preaching."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Well, RevatīnandanaMahārāja.",Prabhupāda, He is a rascal.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,He is preaching like this.,Prabhupāda," He is a rascal. He is becoming rascal, day by day. Stop him doing these things."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"And he's influencing other people. The whole temple in Laguṇa Beach, they were doing this.",Prabhupāda," Then, what can I do? You are all GBCs."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Now that we know, we'll take action.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Revatinandana is becoming less and less spiritually. He had good potency, but he is losing that."
Devotee (1),"You said that if we fast and we can't do our work and we become weak, than this is not so good.",Prabhupāda," This is not good, ""not so"" not, absolutely bad."
Devotee (1),"So, our devotional service comes first?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),"So if there is, let us say there is grain and rice being offered to the Deities, and one finds that if he eats this, his service is impaired. Like so many times I've seen, practically myself if I overeat grains in the summertime, I drive around doing my service and I'm falling asleep.",Prabhupāda, Then which foodstuff suits you?
Devotee (1),Fruits are more... they keep me more active.,Prabhupāda," So you take fruit. Fruit is also offered to the Deity. There are varieties ofprasādam.So whichever suits, you can take. Anything artificial is bad."
Yadubara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Los Angeles they are charging money for theprasādam,and we find that it's cheaper to buy our ownprasādamand offer it ourself.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Yadubara,"They are charging money in Los Angeles for theprasādameach meal, so we find it is cheaper to...",Prabhupāda, Prepare your own?
Yadubara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So you do that.
Harikeśa; Yadubara,Yes. They will not let a householder take unless they pay money first.; 75c for noonprasādamand 50c for breakfast.,Prabhupāda," So if you can prepare cheaper, you can do that."
Yadubara; Brahmānanda; Yadubara,"All right. [break]; It's a type of cannon. [break]; You mentioned before that it is better that we not do so much cooking. If everyone is separately cooking, then that is such a time-consuming thing for everyone.",Prabhupāda," But you said that ""If we cook, it is cheaper."" Then? If it is cheaper, convenient, then you cook. I said that ""You save time. Don't cook."""
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhāvānanda,"The cheapest thing is to cook one thing for... cook for everyone. That is the cheapest and quickest.; During Māyāpur festival, Śrīla Prabhupāda, nicest thing was when we allsatdown together and tookprasādam.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Bhāvānanda,"Five hundred devotees, it was nice, spiritual activity. And everyone took what was given.",Prabhupāda, So what is the difficulty? I do not find. [break]
Bhāvānanda,"...the tongue, I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]",Prabhupāda," Capati,rice is innocent food. What is the difficulty?"
Bhāvānanda,It's nice.,Prabhupāda," Over and above, there is fruit."
Harikeśa,"A lot of devotees are quoting you that... they say that there is no need to eat grains, that you said grains were for the animals.",Prabhupāda, I am...
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa,But Prabhupāda is eating grains. (laughter); I tell them that.,Prabhupāda," Rascal, they say, ""Prabhupāda says."" And you believe that. [break]"
Bhāvānanda,"...I think the people are spoiled. If they go to India, they see that here they're turning down rice; there the people are dying for lack of rice.",Prabhupāda, Where?
Bhāvānanda,"In India. And here they're saying, ""Oh, I don't want this and don't want that. I don't want this grain, that grain."" But in India people are dying for want of food. Here they're so spoiled. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...Kṛṣṇa's position. If He does not supply grains, then He is accused. And He supplies grains, then He is accused. (laughter)"
Bhāvānanda; Satsvarūpa,"Everyone is accused. [break]; ...those scientists came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and even said milk was no good.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yadubara,"That is what they say in these books on health, these health books. They say that cow milk is no good.",Prabhupāda, Ācchā?
Harikeśa; Yadubara,"But meat is all right.; No, some of them, most of them don't say that. It's very contaminating to read those and to follow.",Prabhupāda, Therefore follow takingprasādam.Let whatever may happen.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,That's the best thing. Let us die eatingprasādam.,Prabhupāda, Yes. (laughter) That is devotee.
Sudāmā,"Because in the beginning, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you encouraged us, all of us, to take muchprasādam,to our full satisfaction.",Prabhupāda, Yes. I say still.
Sudāmā; Yadubara; Brahmānanda,"You said that that is one of our greatest weapons againstmāyā,isKṛṣṇa-prasāda.[break]; I'm a good example that these diets are not very good. (laughter) I can testify.; Me too.",Prabhupāda, The diets are not good or you are not good?
Yadubara; Devotee (2),"Oh. [break] ...for one year to alter the diet in so many ways and it never worked. It was useless. [break]; I think that's for maintaining the right depth to the lake. I think they have a pump house down here, and they maintain the depth of the lake by these things.",Prabhupāda, Water is supplied or...?
Devotee (2); Devotee (1),Yes.; Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),"In Denver here we have many businesses going on for you. And we are out engagingkarmīsin helping us retrievelakṣmī.We are going to them forlakṣmīin so many ways. How is it that this engages them, or does it engage them in Kṛṣṇa's service? Do they make any benefit?",Prabhupāda, What they are doing by doing business? They aregṛhasthasdoing business?
Brahmānanda; Devotee (1),"They are outsiders,karmīs,they manufacture jewelry and some shirts, for which they get a salary.; Yes, but the devotees are maintaining the business. And I myself go out and talk to rascals all day long, demons,mlecchas.Am I engaging them in Kṛṣṇa's service by takinglakṣmī?",Prabhupāda, What you are doing with the money?
Devotee (1),I'm giving it to the temple president so that we can buy a farm for you.,Prabhupāda," No, if you are engaging the money forKṛṣṇa, then it is all right."
Brahmānanda,He's asking about is there any benefit to thekarmīsthat he deals with because he engages in business activity with them? Do thekarmīsget benefit?,Prabhupāda, Yes. To some extent they are helpingKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.
Yadubara,"They also have this program in Pittsburg, the same thing. They come to the temple and manufacture jewelry.",Prabhupāda," Svakarmaṇātamabhyarcya.It is mentioned in theBhagavad-gītā.You can see there. Everyone can work, but the result of the work should go toKṛṣṇa. [break]"
Devotee (1),...lakṣmīfrom them so we can engage them more in Kṛṣṇa's service.,Prabhupāda," Provided you engage them for Kṛṣṇa's service. Otherwise thelakṣmīwill kill you. Just likeSītā,SītāisLakṣmī.WhenSītāwas taken byRāvaṇa, the result was the whole family was killed because they did not useSītāfor Rāma's service. [break] ...householders can be engaged, not anyone else."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"So my question is: Supposing half of those men that are in our movement are householders. Would it not be more beneficial that everyone engages in preaching work, or is that impractical?",Prabhupāda," Preaching is for thesannyāsīs,for thebrahmacārī.And householder, because they arebrāhmaṇas,they can be engaged in Deity worship and also earning money."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Business.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,So it's not more practical to earn money by preaching?,Prabhupāda," If preaching, by preaching we can get money, why should we go to thekarmīs?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Because you wrote me in a letter that so far as you are concerned, you think that your books are enough to maintain the society.",Prabhupāda," I think so. But if they think that by doing some other business, they will get more money, then what can I say? This is very good business. Yes. We are preaching, at the same time getting money."
Devotee (2),We have found in our experience that some kinds of men do better in doing business. They feel more satisfied in collecting money in that way forKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, That's all right. But that money should be used forKṛṣṇa.
Devotee (2),Yes. Different kinds of men have to be engaged in different ways. Otherwise they become dissatisfied.,Prabhupāda," Yes. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,svakarmaṇā.Anyone, he likes to do something, that is hiskarma.But by thatkarma,he can serveKṛṣṇa.Svakarmaṇātamabhyarcyasaṁsiddhiṁlabhatenavaḥ.Saṁsiddhimeans perfection. [break]"
Devotee (1),"...in our preaching work we will be able to maintain our temples, and with our business activities, we will be able to expand and buy all these farms, do so many things.",Prabhupāda," Yes. If it is favorable, do it, business.(?) Therefore we have made program: 50% must come toKṛṣṇa, at least.Jaya.HareKṛṣṇa. [break] (In car:)"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,...because that many people are involved.,Prabhupāda," Dieting, the best thing is to takeprasādam."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Definitely. It's clear cut. My only feeling about...,Prabhupāda," And if our... Pushed on our men... The thing is they supply more spices, and especially that mustard. This is not good. This is prohibited."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"It should be mild,prasādam.",Prabhupāda," Practically no spices. Simply little cumin. And this turmeric. Turmeric you get from India, whole turmeric. This powdered turmeric is very, very bad."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa,Unhealthy.; They put sawdust in it.,Prabhupāda, That's all.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,It's very unhealthy.,Prabhupāda, It is very cheating. Any powdered spice is not good.
Harikeśa,Asafoetida also.,Prabhupāda," Everything. As soon as it is powder, they will mix with all rubbish things. And it is very easy to cheat you. You are susceptible for being cheated. So they take advantage and cheat you. So best thing is to import spices from India whole and either get it powdered or during time of cooking you make them paste. That is first class."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Crushing.,Prabhupāda," You just put the spices water, soaked in water for some time, and then in mortar and pestle you..."
Dhanañjaya,Smash it.,Prabhupāda," That is very nice. And immediately you fresh prepare and put into the vegetable. It will be tasteful, and it will be beneficial. All spices are beneficial."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,And much cheaper.,Prabhupāda," Cheaper, of course, there is no question to you what is cheaper. For you everything is ""damn cheap."""
Harikeśa,TheRādhā-Dāmodaraparty has very goodprasādamprogram. Thishalavāthey make every morning—everyone is fully satisfied.,Prabhupāda, They are sane men.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Every morning we have...,Prabhupāda, So why do they not follow your principle?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Ah, it's very... And the devotees love it. Every day, Prabhupāda, we...",Prabhupāda," No, every temple give them example, invite them in yourprasādam."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Harikeśa,Yes. That's what I'm going to do today.; I noticed the devotees would wait forprasādamwith great...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is nice. It requires good leader, that's all. [break] ...Kṛṣṇawe must prepare very first-class foodstuff, and where is the complaint if it is first class?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"It's all a concoction. Certain devotees have concocted. They have taken advice from other masters, food masters, what to eat, what not to eat, all concoction. It's clearly written inBhagavad-gītā,those foods which are sattvic-juicy, fatty. Everything is mentioned there.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Guide them. [break] ...here the main business is slaughterhouse.
Brahmānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"In this state.; Cow country, it's called. They call it that. On the highway you see that, ""Cow country.""",Prabhupāda, Chicago is also this...
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda,"Oh, very bad. That is very bad.; There's one area of the town that there's a bad odor.",Prabhupāda," Here also they say. Just like in Bombay, the Bandra(?)."
Harikeśa; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Ah, terrible.; What's Viṣṇujana doing? [break] ...Deity, I've never seen it. He gets up early in the morning, wakes Him up, cooks for Him, then we offerārati,then bathing and dressing the Deity, sings for Him all day. He's so devoted toRādhā-Dāmodara.",Prabhupāda," Svarūpa-siddhi,arcana-siddhi.By simply worshiping Deity one can become perfect.Arcana-siddhi."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"That's a great advantage of our bus. Now we just traveled for two days in a row fromSanFrancisco, but we did not miss oneārati,we had sixāratis,fullprasādam.We took bath on the bus in our shower room. We had regular classes,kīrtanaall day. It was undisturbed.",Prabhupāda, So why not one week with them? I am prepared. (end)
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So bullet expected also? (laughs)
Brahmānanda,"All great leaders, they live in constant fear.",Prabhupāda," Bhayaṁdvitīyābhiniveśataḥsyāt.Everyone, animal up to the king of heaven—always fearful.Ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁca.So fearfulness is one of the qualification of conditioned soul. Yesterday you were putting forward the logic, ""Machine."" Machine, we also accept. InBhagavad-gītāit is mentioned, this body is machine,yantra.Yantrameans machine. So at the same time, you said, ""Growing."" Do you grow machine Ford car?"
Ambarīṣa,"Do they grow? No, they... (laughs)",Prabhupāda," Then how the analogy is perfect? Machine it is. That is accepted.Kṛṣṇasays. That is undoubtedly, it is machine. It is nothing but machine. So machine, at the same time, he says, ""It grows."" How it can be comparable?"
Brahmānanda,The body is compared to a machine.,Prabhupāda," Not... It is machine, not compared. It is machine. Actually it is machine."
Brahmānanda,But then it cannot grow because a machine does not grow.,Prabhupāda, No.
Ambarīṣa,So it is changing every second.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like this is a car, machine, but if I want a bigger car, that means another car, not this car is growing. Suppose sometimes you get baby car. That is not sufficient. I want big car. So you cannot say that increase the baby car and it becomes a sedan car. That means you require another big car. A child, a child cannot have sex in that body. The same child, when he wants to enjoy sex, he must have another body. So these rascals, they cannot understand how different machines has been supplied by nature. It is supplying."
Ambarīṣa,"Yes, I think it's...",Prabhupāda," As soon as you want another machine, immediately it is...Svābhāvikībala-kriyācaparāsyaśaktir vividhaiva.His potencies, his merit, is acting. Not his merit, means the nature's merit,prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27],it is working so swiftly. You cannot see. The same example as I give always, that the movies spool, each is a different picture, but when it is put into the projector, you cannot understand. But actually on the background there are different pictures. So if ordinary cinematograph, cinema picture, we can make like that, how much nicely and subtle machine is there, it is being done—that you do not know. But each body, each second, you are being supplied a different body."
Brahmānanda,Like each of the different frames.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Brahmānanda,On the film each frame is different.,Prabhupāda, Is different.
Brahmānanda,Each picture. But what appears to be a complete...,Prabhupāda," So in one picture you will find hand is here, another picture hand is here, another hand is here, but when they are taken together, it means the hand moves. The example is there. Each picture is a different picture. As soon as you stop it, the hand is here. That's all."
Ambarīṣa,So each second the body is a little different?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Each second the body is different. But what this rascal will do? How they will know? They have no brain. All dull-headed materialistic,mūḍha.They cannot understand this. But this is the process going on. I want, for certain thing, I want a different body. Immediately nature supplies."
Yadubara,Even within this body?,Prabhupāda, Why within? Another body you cannot see. Not within—without. Another body supplied.
Ambarīṣa,"Sometimes when people are put into a dangerous situation, they acquire extraordinary strength, just like that, that they never had before. So it's like they...",Prabhupāda," No, no. You must expect according to your quality. Just like ifKṛṣṇawants, He can make something else. But you are not independent. You are dependent on nature, and your position is very insignificant. ButKṛṣṇacan, as soon as He wishes—immediately done.Parasyaśaktir vividhaiva.Just like in Bible it is said, ""God said, 'Let there be creation.' There was creation immediately."" But you cannot do that. But if you... Whatever you are desiring, nature is supplying you.Kṛṣṇais also being supplied by nature, that is spiritual nature. And you are also being supplied by the material nature. So both nature is working.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ,ahaṅkāra... [Bg.3.27]. Each stage is a different form. That is going on."
Ambarīṣa,The scientists say that every seven years the body...,Prabhupāda, Not seven years. A medical man says every moment the blood corpuscles are changing.
Ambarīṣa,Are different?,Prabhupāda," Yes. New blood cells are coming into being. So you cannot say machine growing. That is fallacious. A machine, new machine. (Everyone gets out of car)"
Ambarīṣa,"New machine,jaya.",Prabhupāda," As soon as I want a smaller car, not smaller car, I want bigger car, smaller car also. That is change. Whatever you deserve. You desire; at the same time, you deserve. First deserve, then desire. Just like these rascals, ""I desire to become God."" That kind of desire will never be fulfilled."
Yadubara,It's according to the qualification also.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Your position is very minute. So you can desire up to that limit, not that you can desire ""I become complete, universal."" That is the defect of theMāyāvāda. ""Because I am equal...So 'ham.Because I am qualitatively one, therefore I am one in every respect."" A drop of ocean water, if he desires, ""I become ocean,"" that is not possible. But a drop of ocean water contains the same ingredients as the big Pacific Ocean. So in your quantitative proportion, if you desire, that is your perfection."
Brahmānanda,Understanding one's position.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda; Devotee (1),That's sensible. [break]; Like in the Tenth Chapter it's talking about...,Prabhupāda," Hm, not come very near. Yes?"
Devotee (1),"It's talking about thatArjunasaw the universal form, all these universes and all that. So does that mean like you were talking that one can't become a universal being, but he can see the whole universe. Can you explain how that is?",Prabhupāda," How is that? You can see the universe; that does not mean that you can become universe. You can see the sky; that does not mean you become as big as sky. [break] ...small, minute shining sparks, minute combination. So they are also shining, but that does not mean they can become as good, as big, as the sun. [break] ...the defect of theMāyāvādaphilosophy. They think of themselves too much. Therefore they remain here, always inmāyā.[break]...abuddhayaḥ,means the intelligence is not purified. They are calledaviśuddha-buddhayaḥorviśuddha[SB10.2.32],""without purification of knowledge."" [break]...kṛcchreṇaparaṁpadaṁtataḥpatantyadhaḥanādṛta-yuṣmād-aṅghrayaḥ.They fall down. [break] ...this symbol?"
Harikeśa,Some fountain.,Prabhupāda," No, there are some children, symbolic."
Brahmānanda,They're looking at the water. [break],Prabhupāda," ...written, ""Danger."" Now they are going to the safety. What is danger, there is that safety. Now, what is danger and what is safety?"
Brahmānanda,That means it is relative.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Everything is relative. Therefore it is called relative world. [break]
Brahmānanda,"It's according to the body. Because the duck has a particular body, the water for him is safety, and because we have this particular body, it is dangerous.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),[break] ...true that when you become more purified that you will see everything differently with your eyes and hear everything differently with your ears and all this?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (1),"We won't see things the way we perceive them now, right?",Prabhupāda," If you are suffering from cataract, how you can see distinctly? You have to get your eyes operated. Then you can see. So ourbhaktiprocess is simply purifying, purifying, more, more, more. When you are completely purified, you see God face to face, eye to eye, talk with Him, play with Him, just like cowherds boys, they are playing, thegopīsare dancing. You get that position. [break]"
Yadubara,"...You said in theBhāgavatam,speaking aboutDhruvaMahārāja, that his senses became enlivened.",Prabhupāda," Senses are there. It is purified.Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁtat-paratvenanirmalam[Cc.Madhya19.170].Thebhaktiprocess is completely, complete process to purify you. Other process are not.Karma,jñāna,yogacannot purify you cent percent, butbhaktiprocess can purify you cent percent."
Harikeśa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, what's the difference between a Brahmavādī and aMāyāvādī?",Prabhupāda, That you already questioned. We answered.
Harikeśa,I did?,Prabhupāda, Yes. [break] ...vādīmeans those who are aspiring to merge into the impersonalBrahmaneffulgence.
Harikeśa,"And Māyāvādīs, they do not attain that impersonal realization?",Prabhupāda, Māyāvādīs remain fools forever.
Harikeśa,They never leave this material platform.,Prabhupāda," They do not know. They have no knowledge.Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ[SB10.2.32],always impure. Otherwise how they are thinking,so 'ham:""I am same. I am God. I am moving the sun, I am..."" Such rascals, they remain always in ignorance. [break] ...no sense that ""If I am the same, then why I have fallen down in thismāyā?""They say, ""It is mylīlā.I have become dog. So it is mylīlā.I have become hog. It is mylīlā."" (laughs) This is their philosophy.HareKṛṣṇa. [break]Māyāvāda. They are fools,mūḍha. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.They are described in theBhagavad-gītā.Māyāvādīmeansmāyayāpahṛta-jñānā:""Their knowledge has been taken away bymāyā."" Fools. Either you call them fool or call them lowest of the mankind or the most sinful, whatever way you can call, they are like that. All good qualifications. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhuhas warned,māyāvādī-bhāṣyaśunilehayasarva-nāśa:[Cc.Madhya6.169] ""If you hear fromMāyāvādī, then your spiritual life is finished."" It's so dangerous."
Harikeśa,The Brahmavādīs have some possibility of advancement?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Harikeśa,What is that thing that enables them to advance?,Prabhupāda, That you will know later on. First of all try to understand this. Don't try to understand everything in a moment. That is foolishness. [break] That argument is clear?
Ambarīṣa,Yes.,Prabhupāda," That if you call it a machine, how the machine can grow?"
Ambarīṣa,The machine is changing at every second.,Prabhupāda," You say two things: ""Growing"" and ""machine."" So that is incomparable. Machine cannot grow."
Ambarīṣa; Brahmānanda,"Jaya.[break]; ...many machines. You get another machine, another one, and another and another.",Prabhupāda, So I have changed so many machines. So death means another machine. Where is the difficulty?
Ambarīṣa,"When the spirit soul leaves the body, the body continues to change, it deteriorates?",Prabhupāda," No, no. Spirit soul is changing machine. That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā.So when this machine is finished, and another machine."
Ambarīṣa,"The old machine continues to change after the spirit soul leaves, it deteriorates? The old machine deterior..., it breaks down.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. You give up one machine and you take another machine. [break]"
Devotee (1),...one goes into a subtle machine?,Prabhupāda," That example is given,vāsāṁsijīrṇāniyathāvihāya[Bg.2.22].Just like your dress, when it is useless, you throw it away and take another dress. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Vāsāṁsijīrṇāniyathāvihāyagṛhṇātinaraḥaparāṇi.You accept another set of dress. Clearly explained. [break] ...also very scientific. Just like according to your last life's desires, you have got this dress, this body. So it is going on, going on, going on. Now you are creating another set of desires in this life. So you require a different dress. Then you begin another satisfaction of your desires. This is going on.Karmāṇadaiva-netreṇa: [SB3.31.1] by yourkarma,you are creating a situation. Just like the criminal, he has created a situation; he cannot live anymore outside the jail. ""Come on, here."" He will go in automatically. So they do not know how nature is working. It is clearly said,prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27].""Nature is working, and that nature is working,""mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg.9.10],""under My superintendence."" Everything is there.Mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram.Jagat,it is changing, always changing. How it is changing? Under the direction of God.Mayādhyakṣeṇa."
Devotee (1),OnlyKṛṣṇais doing everything then.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Kṛṣṇais not like you that when you are given some business, you become embarrassed. That is the difference betweenKṛṣṇaand you. He never becomes embarrassed."
Devotee (1),"Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it true that our advancement in devotional services... Is it influenced a lot by our pastkarma,how many sinful activities we have committed?",Prabhupāda," No, no, no.Bhaktiis not underkarma.Bhaktiis under your good will. If you accept to surrender toKṛṣṇa, you can do that without being checked by anything else. Simply you have to will, ""Yes,Kṛṣṇa. You are asking me. So long I did not do. From this day I do."" That will depend upon you."
Devotee (2),"Not that if I was more sinful, I would make less advancement than somebody who is more pious.",Prabhupāda," Whatever you may be, simply surrender and everything is finished.Ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣ...[Bg.18.66]. Even if you are sinful,Kṛṣṇawill give you release, ""All right. You have surrendered. That's all right."" That is wanted. If you reserve something and cheatKṛṣṇa, ""Now I am surrendering,""Kṛṣṇais very intelligent. ""You have still reservation. No."" [break]"
Devotee (1),...it's easier to surrender toKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes, insattva-guṇaone can see, one can understand his position. [break]"
Devotee (2),"Does he experience the miseries of the gross body when he's insattva-guṇa,in the mode of goodness? Does he experience hunger and thirst, those things like that?",Prabhupāda, Gross body means no hunger?

Devotee (2),"You were saying that when one is in the mode of goodness, that he is on the mental platform?",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Devotee (2),"Does that mean that he's not... He's experiencing the subtle body inside of the gross body, or what does that mean exactly?",Prabhupāda," Mental platform is mixedsattva-guṇa,rajo-guṇa,not pure.

Devotee (2),His bodily senses.,Prabhupāda, There is no question of outer senses. Senses purified. What do you mean by outer senses?
Devotee (2),The senses with which you perceive the outer gross...,Prabhupāda," That always remains. But when it is not purified, you perceive material things. When it is purified, you perceive spiritual things."
Devotee (2),So the same gross senses will be able to see spiritual things.,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is purified.Bhaktiis the purifying process. I have already said. Not that the eyes are suffering from cataract disease, ""Pluck out."" That isMāyāvādīphilosophy."
Devotee (2),"What does that mean, then, when the yogis withdraw their senses from the objects like it says like the tortoise withdraws his limbs within the shell? What does that refer to then?",Prabhupāda, Hm? What is that? I do not follow.
Brahmānanda,"He asks, in theyogasystem...",Prabhupāda," Yogasystem means always see Supersoul; that is realyogasystem.

He is seeing nothing else."
Devotee (1),"He doesn't see the Supersoul with the gross senses, though, does he?",Prabhupāda, Pure senses. He does not... Impure senses and pure senses.

Devotee (2),"Then we will actually attain that condition, then.",Prabhupāda," Try to become purified. Don't imagine and guess, ""What will be the condition when I am purified?"" This is all nonsense. Try to become purified."
Devotee (2),Then you perceive it.,Prabhupāda, Yes.

Kuruśreṣṭha,"They say that without the bad, then the good wouldn't be as good.",Prabhupāda," So you remain with bad and good. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. That possibility is here. Sometimes you are going to the higher heavenly planets, a long duration of life, better standard of enjoyment—again coming back.

If one has to be punished, instead of putting into the jail and feed him, the officers will take him to a river and put him in the water. In this way, one day doing, he will say ""I will never do these things. Please excuse me.""Daṇḍya-janerāja-janenaditecubaya.[break] ...unless one remembers this, that ""To be in the material world, how suffocating it is,"" he will not fit for going to back to Godhead. He must be completely detestful. If he keeps little attachment, ""No, it is very good sometimes,"" then you have to remain here. [break] ""This is not permanent. I shall be put next moment in the bad condition."" That he must know. That is knowledge. And if he makes compromise, then he has to be again... [break]"
Devotee (4),"...consciousness part of this life, up to the time of death, in our next life we will be put in a situation immediately where we can take upKṛṣṇaconsciousness again or will we have to sufferkarmabefore we came intoKṛṣṇaconsciousness?",Prabhupāda, You will getKṛṣṇaconscious again.Yoga-bhraṣṭaḥsañjāya... Śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭaḥsañjāyate[Bg.6.41].AKṛṣṇaconscious person will be given all comforts of material life so that he may regain without any botheration.
Yadubara,Sometimes it is stated thatKṛṣṇawill take everything away from the devotee.,Prabhupāda," That is special favor, (laughter) that ""This rascal is again attached. Take all his..."" That is special favor. That is not ordinary favor, so that when everything is taken away, he will completely surrender toKṛṣṇa, ""Kṛṣṇa, I have nothing except You."""
Kuruśreṣṭha,Once one performs devotional service then he can't get away fromKṛṣṇa. Can he still get away? It seems like...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that option is always, because you are independent."
Kuruśreṣṭha,"I see with myself that if I try to get away a little bit, He beats me so much that I have to come back.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is special favor.
Yadubara,SoKṛṣṇais directly controlling that?,Prabhupāda," Yes. When He sees, ""That fool wants Me, at the same time, material world. So take his material possession, everything, so that he will want only Me, that's all."" Actually, it was done to me. (laughs) I have got practical experience. I did not want to takesannyāsa.I thought that I shall do business. AndKṛṣṇaforced me to takesannyāsaand all, everything, dismantled."
Devotee (4); Yadubara,Kṛṣṇa's mercy on us.; But your business was successful...,Prabhupāda," I was thinking of becoming Birla, but I am now more than Birla. This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy."
Brahmānanda,Birla gives you money now.,Prabhupāda," Not only that, how many branches Birla has? It is an example, yes."
Devotee (4),"Śrīla Prabhupāda, if a devotee gets sick, should he go and take medicine?",Prabhupāda, Better not to take.
Devotee (4),Just depend onKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is very good. What is this?"
Kuruśreṣṭha; Yadubara,"Rosehips. (Horse hips(?) Forceps(?)); You said the other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we should take care of disease if it comes. CāṇakyaPaṇḍitawas also saying fire and so on.",Prabhupāda, That is material consciousness.
Brahmānanda,Fasting is one way of eliminating the disease without taking medicine.,Prabhupāda," Yes. There is a Indian proverb that ""Disease and unwanted guest, if you don't give food, they will go away."" If some guest has come whom you do not want, don't give him food. Then he will go away. (laughter) Similarly, disease, if you fast, it will go away. [break] ...another story:prahareṇadhanañjaya.One gentleman had eight or nine daughters and son-in-law. So when they came, he was giving them good food and shelter, everything. So then they saw, ""We are very comfortably living at father-in-law's expense."" So they did not want to go. The father-in-law saw, ""It is very dangerous that all the son-in-laws are not going."" Then he began to... First day he did not supply salt. So one son-in-law say, ""Oh, they are now disrespecful, they have not given salt."" So one went away. And next day, something else, something else, something else, shortened, shortened. So those who were intelligent, they went away. The last one, he was not going. Then his brother-in-laws thought that ""Give him good beating."" Then he went away.Prahareṇadhanañjaya.Others, those who were intelligent, they, when they thought that ""Now there is disrespectful dealing, they are not giving everything,"" so they gradually... The last one, he was a rascal. He was beaten severely; then he went away."
Yadubara,"So if we're beaten by this material nature, then we'll go away.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Yes. No, material nature's business is beating and kicking. That's his only business. But we are so fool, we are taking, ""Oh, very nice kicking."" That is the disease. We accept the kicking as very nice. That is foolishness. We are suffering always by three kinds of...,ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika,ādhidaivikadisturbances. There is disturbance in the body, in the mind, disturbance by other living entities, so many, disturbed by climate, disturbed by famine. Always disturbance. Still, we are thinking, ""It is very nice place."" This is foolishness. Still, we are trying to improve it. That is foolishness. He does not think that ""What is the meaning of improvement? The disturbing is always continuing."" That does not come to his brain. They are making improvement. [break] ...improvement, they can say, ""This is improvement."" But how long this improvement will go? If there is no rainfall, what this improvement will help? So that is not in your hand. That isādhidaivika.It depends on the demigods. If they want, they can stop completely, no rainfall. Then what this improvement will do?"
Brahmānanda,There'll be no water for their machines.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So they are thinking that ""This is improvement."" What is this nonsense improvement? You are dependent fully on other elements. What improvement will do? AndKṛṣṇasays, ""This is a place for misery."" How you will improve? This is folly, this is illusion.Kṛṣṇasays, ""This place is for suffering,"" and you are making improvement. ""Yes, we are advancing. In future we shall live. Nobody will die."" Therefore they are called rascals. Persons who are trying to do something which is impossible, they are fools.Mūḍha.They do not see, still, they hope, ""Yes, we are trying. We shall do in future."" This is going on. This is the example by the ass. The ass... Driver is sitting on the back of the ass and showing one bunch of grass, and the ass is thinking, ""I will get it."" (laughter) And he is going on, and he is sitting safely, that ""The ass will go on."" So our improvement is like that. ""Just little forward, then I shall get the grass."" He will never get the grass. That he has no brain, that ""I am improving; the grass also improving, going on."" That they do not see. Now we invented so many airship. It was thought, ""Oh, now it will be very nice. Within two hours we shall reach somewhere."" Now there are so many dangers. Now there is problem, how to protect us from these accidents."
Brahmānanda,Now they have too many airplanes.,Prabhupāda, Too many airplanes. So where is the improvement? Improvement means to die altogether two hundred men at a time. This is improvement.
Kuruśreṣṭha,They are trying to create a plastic body with plastic heart transplants and plastic liver. They feel that as soon as they can replace all the breakable parts with replaceble ones...,Prabhupāda, That is a Frankenstein? (laughter)
Yadubara,"They're very persistent, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, That is the foolishness. Fools are very persistent.
Brahmānanda,"I was reading that in order to go to the moon, it took ten years and the cost was 25 billion dollars.",Prabhupāda, Just see how foolish they are. And again they are trying.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].Chewing the chewed. This is their business. Horrible civilization.
Kāśīrāma,Mistaking suffering for happiness.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambarīṣa,"They are always trying to look for the bright side, but there is no bright side.",Prabhupāda," Just like north of Sweden, there is no sunrise?"
Brahmānanda,No.,Prabhupāda," So where is bright side? Where is bright side? Vedic injunction istamasimājyotirgama:""Don't remain in this darkness; go to the bright world.""Jyotirgama.[break] ...to create some bright side. He will not be allowed to enjoy it. He will have to die. So where is your bright side? [break] ...for preparing?"
Brahmānanda,For the moon? 25 billion dollars.,Prabhupāda, So again I am trying to go another planet. Where is the guarantee that it will be successful?
Brahmānanda,"On the contrary, if they failed once, then we should think that they would fail again.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is animalism. A dog is coming, and you show him some stick or beat him. He will go away for the time being. Again he will come. That is dog. He doesn't get lesson by one. Therefore it is calledpunaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30].Repeating the same thing again and again. That is animalism."
Yadubara,They actually think that they were successful.,Prabhupāda," Unless they say, how they will adjust so much money spent? What account they will give? They must bluff, ""Yes, it is successful."" I saw in the Allahabad high-court. One man was condemned to death. I told you?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So one barrister, Mr. Allston, he was pacifying, ""Don't worry, I shall appeal and get you released. Don't worry."" (laughter) I heard it. I was passing, and Mr. Allston was advising his client. He was morose. ""Don't worry, I shall appeal and get you released."" [break] ...condemned person was a medical man, and he killed his servant in the surgical room because the servant was implicated with his wife. This is the story. [break]"
Brahmānanda,...English?,Prabhupāda," No, no, Indian."
Brahmānanda,And the man was also Indian?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,"But the barrister, he was English.",Prabhupāda," He was appointed because he was a big barrister. Formerly any European, he is very big. So he appointed a very big barrister."
Brahmānanda,"Oh, he was a rich Indian.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Brahmānanda,How he could get such a...,Prabhupāda," He was a medical man. Yes, rich, rich. [break] ...they have arranged to have the meeting with this Professor Dimmock?"
Brahmānanda,I didn't ask. They were supposed to do it. (end),Prabhupāda, ...resembling Boston. That students' quarter?
Brahmānanda,Yes. [break],Prabhupāda, Go to the beach now. [break] Sweet water?
Bhavānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, No.
Bhavānanda,This is fresh water. [break],Prabhupāda," ...Angeles, I have seen while going to the beach, one man has made a boat of concrete cement. Did you see? Nobody marked?"
Viṣṇujana,"In California there are such boats, concrete boats.",Prabhupāda, They are used?
Viṣṇujana,"Oh yes. They are used for taking cargo up and down the coast. They don't travel in the ocean, but they travel on the coast. They used them during the Second World War all over the United States.",Prabhupāda, Such boat does not drown?
Viṣṇujana,They keep it up by huge air tanks. By holding so much air they keep the cement up. [break],Prabhupāda, ...ficial means. Otherwise it will drown.

TamālaKṛṣṇa,"The lake water, doesn't increase. [break]",Prabhupāda, ...never. [break] Dirty water?
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Brahmānanda; Devotee 1; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"This is a boat ramp, where they let boats down. The water doesn't look very clean.; There's a lot of shipping in these lakes.; They also pump a lot of refuse from the industry in there. I think it's polluted.

When he's taking his meals he should not leave anything on the plate. But sometimes we have heard in the past that asannyāsīshould leave something on the plate.",Prabhupāda, No. Sometimes theguruleaves some remnant to be taken by the disciple.

There's nothing beyond it.",Prabhupāda," Then seeing and not seeing, the same thing? That is, means you see or not see... Is that mean, that seeing or not seeing? This is contradictory. Either you see or you don't see. These are two things. (laughter) But what is this ""I see, I don't see""?"
Viṣṇujana,"For that, they spend millions of dollars on a telescope.",Prabhupāda," And just see. That which is impossible, they are trying for that.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30],chewing the chewed, that's all. When your senses are imperfect, then what you will see? Whatever you see, that is imperfect. So what is the meaning of seeing? Therefore our seeing isśāstra-cakṣuṣāt:""We should see through the authorized scriptures."" That is our... You will see in the description of Śukadeva Gosvāmī of the whole universe, conclusion, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, ""So far I have described as I have heard."" He never says, ""As I have seen."" This is required. [break] ...that we believe in the creation. And others also, just like Christians, they also believe God created. But who has seen God is creating? Who has seen? Simply hear from God. He says, ""I have created."" That's all. But if you challenge, ""I have not seen that You have created; neither I have seen You,"" then how can you believe? God says, ""I have created,"" so those who are God believers, they will accept that. So what is the use of seeing again, observatory? We trust in God, but don't trust in His word. This is going on. You write in America, ""We trust in God,"" but don't trust in His word. (laughs) Just see. If God you trust, then whatever God says, you believe. ""No, that we cannot do."" This is the (indistinct).

Not only mosquito, you will find at night I see a small insect, less than the magnitude of full stop. (Makes insect sound:) ""Gu, gu, gu, gu."" The same machine is there.

Mayor,"No. I know about the article on the crime and I have it at home, but I have not read it as yet. But we certainly know that it's a tremendous problem in the United States, perhaps throughout the world and certainly here.",Prabhupāda," It is not a problem. Just like there is disease, and there is remedy also. And as much as the disease is chronic, the remedy is also costly. So in the western countries—do not mind—they are not trying to educate first-class men, and that is the difficulty. This advancement, technical knowledge, to have nice motor cars or big, big buildings, highways, this is very good, but this is not the aim of life."
Mayor,"No, material things should not be.",Prabhupāda," They are missing the aim of life. That is the... The aim of life is, an..., not according to Vedic, but anyone, the aim of life is how to realize God. That is aim. In the animal life or in other lives less important than the human being there is no question of God realization. In the human life, the civilized human life, there is religion. It doesn't matter whether one is Christian or aHinduor a Muslim or a Buddhist. These are the principle religions of the world. So any civilized man must be inquisitive to know what is the original source of everything. That philosophy is there. It is calledBrahma-sūtraorVedānta-sūtra.Perhaps you have heard the name,Vedāntaphilosophy.Vedameans knowledge, andantameans end. In the materialistic way of knowledge they did not find any end, and they accept it ""That this is progress."" But one must come to the end of the knowledge, what is the ultimate knowledge. So generally they are missing what is the ultimate knowledge. We are searching after knowledge in so many ways but what is the ultimate knowledge? The ultimate knowledge,Vedānta, means end of knowledge. End of knowledge means to understand the original source of everything.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.The human inquisitiveness should be up to that point, what is the origin of everything. Because human life is not a spot. That... The western people are lacking that understanding. We are thinking that this duration of life, say, for fifty to a hundred years, that is all. No. That is the first instruction in theBhagavad-gītā,that this body is not everything. We have to accept another body after death.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].As we are accepting different bodies in our this span of life from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youthhood, from youthhood to old age... So this is the example. And after this old age, after this body is useless, then I accept another body. And again another chapter of life begins. And on my next life, next body I am creating,kāraṇaṁguṇa-saṅgaḥasya,infection. Just like if I infect some disease, I am creating that disease. If I infect smallpox disease, then I must develop that disease. How it is, subtle way, working, that we cannot see. But if somewhere I have infected some disease, somewhere it will be manifest. It will manifest. You cannot check it. So in this material world there are three qualities: goodness, passion, and ignorance. So as we associate, we develop a type of body. So these crimes means they do not get good association. Naturally they are developing. And now these boys, they are also Americans and Europeans. They are getting good association, and they are becoming free from all bad habits. We generally take bad character on the basis of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling."
Mayor,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So they were habituated to all... Because that is a system in the European, American life. But now they are free. That is Professor Judah's remark in his letter. Have you got that? Yes. He has written one book,HareKṛṣṇaand Counterculture,about our movement. He has read all our books. Here are, you have shown all these books? So he appreciates, many gentlemen appreciate, even the priestly class, they also appreciate. So this is a movement which is trying to create at least a section to become first-class. The first-class man does not mean that he is nicely dressed or very rich or very opulent. Generally, of course, a first-class man means good parentage, good education, good looking and nicely rich. That is the standard. But... That may be first-class position, but first-class man is different. First-class man means he is self-controlled, in the mind he is undisturbed, he is truthful, he is very clean, inside and outside, he is very simple, tolerant, full of knowledge, practical application of knowledge, and believe in God. This is first-class man. There is no mention that he is rich, he is beautiful, bodily, or he is educated. Educated, this is a result of education. Real education means that he is self controlled. Controlling the mind, controlling the senses, truthful. He will speak truth in any circumstances. Even to his enemy he will speak the truth. And clean, and very simple, tolerant. And any knowledge, he has got some, I mean to say, strength over it. Ultimate knowledge,Brahmān, he believes in that and he has...Brahmajanātītībrāhmaṇaḥ,This is first-class man. So it is not expected that everyone will become first-class. but there must be a section in the society, ideal first-class. And they will be advisor to the rest. Thesebrāhmaṇas,they will not take part in politics, but those who are politicians, administrators, they should take advice from these first-class men, how to rule, how to control, what is the ideal. So the ruling class, they are calledkṣatriyas.So find out this verse,śamaḥdamaḥ..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,You want about thekṣatriyaor thebrāhmaṇas?,Prabhupāda," Brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,,Prabhupāda, This is first-class man. And the second-class man?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,,Prabhupāda, That is second-class. And the third-class?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,,Prabhupāda," They are not cattle raising, that was..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Cow protection.,Prabhupāda," Cow protection. It has to be corrected. It isgo-rakṣya, go.They take it cattle-raising. I thinkHayagrīvahas translated like this."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Hayagrīva.,Prabhupāda," No, it is especially mentionedgo-rakṣya.Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁvaiśya-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.44].And then...?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Paricaryātmakaṁkarmaśūdrasyāpisvabhāva-jam.,Prabhupāda," And to serve under somebody, that isśūdra.So at the present moment people are being educated to serve under somebody. Technology, one is very expert in some particular line of technology, say, computer machine... You know how to operate. It is a big qualification. But unless he gets a job under some big establishment, he is useless. He cannot live independently. The first-class man will live independently. The second-class man also will live independently. And the third-class men, they will also live independently. And those who cannot live independently, they are fourth-class men. So at the present moment we are simply creating fourth-class men. So fourth-class men, they are prone to be degraded. If you don't raise them to become first-class, they must degrade. So that is the position of the present civilization. They are creating all fourth-class men, and gradually they are degrading. So now you should take up very seriously how you can create some first-class men. First-class, second-class, third-class also. If you simply remain in the fourth grade, technology... Technology means he has to serve under somebody. This industry, that is also the same thing. Hundreds and thousands of men are working. They are fourth-class men. Andśūdra.Just like formerly in Indian village... Still there are. They are self-supported. Suppose there is a blacksmith. If you require some black iron instrument, you go there and he will prepare immediately. Say, an oil crusher, extracting oil. So weaver, self-supported. Now these things have been taken in larger scale. That is called industry. But actually these things are meant for theśūdras,fourth-class men. So the problem is that if we keep men fourth-class or increase only fourth-class men, so these things are automatic, the resultant action. Therefore, in the western countries especially, everywhere, all over the world, the attempt should be how to create first-class, second-class. At least these two classes required: good politicians, administrators, and good advisors. So this program we are placing before the world. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. So I would suggest that in your country you are resourceful. You can take up this movement very seriously. And it is not expected that cent percent of the population will become first-class, but there must be ideal groups of first-class, second-class, third-class and the rest, fourth-class. That is required."
Mayor,"It takes a great deal of discipline to try to achieve these ideals, and that's one thing that seems to be difficult these days, especially in young people, to have any sense of the need for discipline at all.",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Jagadīśa,He says young people today have no sense of discipline. They don't know what it means to be...,Prabhupāda," How they can be? They are not trained up. They are not trained up from the very beginning. For being trained up, there is another four divisions,brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.These are the training divisions. So for the first-class, second-class, third-class, all the students, they are trained up asbrahmacārī,student life.Brahmacārīmeans celibacy, live under the direction of the teacher and accept all kinds of hardship under the teacher's or spiritual master direction. Children, they can easily take it. If a child, a small child, I ask him, ""My dear child, you take my shoes and keep it there,"" he will immediately agree. He has no sense, ""Oh, he is asking me to take his shoes."" He will immediately agree. Even he is very rich man's son. So this life is advised that a student live just like a menial servant of the teacher or the spiritual master. And they agree. We have got good instances. And he is coming from the first-class family,brāhmaṇafamily orkṣatriyafamily orvaiśyafamily, first, second, third. So evenśūdrafamily, he can learn also. Sobrahmacārī.Then he is, if he can remain without wife or without opposite sex, then he continues to remain asbrahmacārī.He is encouraged. This process encourages to remainbrahmacārī,that ""Don't take to sex life, it is entailed with so many difficulties. Practice to remain abrahmacārī.You'll save so much trouble."" But if he is unable—the teacher sees-Then he is allowed to marry, marriage. If he is trained upbrahmacārī,when he marries, he lives with wife under rules and regulation, not like cats and dogs. And then, because he had previous training, at a certain age he gives up family life. That is calledvānaprastha. Pañcaśordhvamvānamvrajet.Thevānaprasthalife is accepted, generally, after fiftieth year, not earlier. Then the husband and wife travels all over, I mean to say, spiritual sanctified places. In India there are so many places. So in this way, there is no sex in thevānaprastha.Simply the wife remains as assistant. And she also practices austerities. And then the husband, when he is fully mature, he sends wife back to his elderly children to take care of her and he takessannyāsa.So this is spiritual advancement, and insannyāsalife, one is absolutely dedicated for the service of God. So in this way his life becomes perfect. And according to his perfection, he gets next birth in higher planetary system. In the upper planets, planetary system, there is Svargaloka up to the third-class man. And then, above that, there are Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapaloka, Satyaloka, Brahmaloka. And beyond that, there is spiritual world. So in this way life becomes perfect. If you want, you can go to the spiritual world. Spiritual world means no more accepting this material body. And so long we are in this material world we repeat one body after another. And if we degrade ourself to become criminals, then we degrade to the hellish planets down this universe. So human civilization means by nature's way, by evolutionary process, he has come to this body of human being. He should now decide that whether he should remain in this chain of birth and death or he should get out of it and go to the spiritual world. This training required. So throughout the whole world there is no such institution to study all this fact. They are going just like fourth-class men. They have decided out of their own accord that there is no life after death. Young men say that there is no old age, but nature will not agree. Your next life is old age. That is natural. You cannot say, ""No, no, I don't believe in it."" You believe or not believe, it will come. Similarly, you believe or not believe, your next life is there. That is described in theBhagavad-gītā.Find out."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,You want the translation to it?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"""As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.""",Prabhupāda," So this education is required. America is resourceful and they are intelligent. And the movement is already there,HareKṛṣṇamovement, people are appreciating gradually. So if we get little cooperation from the authorities, we can push on this movement more solidly. So you are the chief of this city. If you give us some facility, then we can be useful to counteract this position."
Mayor,"Well, we'd like to cooperate and we certainly need a different approach I think because we're not being successful now in trying to...",Prabhupāda," No, this way will never be successful. It will degrade more and more. So our process is very simple. That is theCaitanyaMahāprabhu's contribution, that we chant... Where is that letter? Professor Judah's? Just read that."
Brahmānanda,"""I feel certain my book will help people both to understand the teachings ofKṛṣṇathe of His descent asCaitanyaand to realize howKṛṣṇaconsciousness has transformed lives from drug-addicted hippies to loving servants ofKṛṣṇaand humanity.""",Prabhupāda," This is his study. He has written a book. So we can stop this, provided we are given the facility to work on."
Mayor,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So I was thinking. Just in front there is a very nice house, big house. You have knowledge about this house?"
Mayor,"No, I...",Prabhupāda, What is that building?
ŚrīGovinda; Mayor,"Merrywood.; Oh, we are right across the street from Merrywood, yes, uhhuh, which we're going to have as a city hall.",Prabhupāda, Oh. You have decided?
Mayor,"Yes, uhhuh, about, oh, just two weeks ago actually, the council...",Prabhupāda, So is it not possible to use this house at least for some time for this movement?
Mayor,"The, er... I'm not sure what the time schedule is, but it's my impression that they were going to start remodeling it for city purposes later this year. It's about a three million dollar project, both for the purchase of the land from the sisters and the remodeling to make it suitable for various city needs. And then they're going to... The city is now located at nine different locations, that is, their facilities. And they're trying to incorporate them all in this one place so that when people need city services, they can just go one place and get all the...",Prabhupāda," But this is more important. City service is going on, but criminals are increasing. So why not give us little opportunity?"
Mayor; ŚrīGovinda,"Well, I could certainly discuss this with the city manager and see what could be worked out.; Possibly we could invite the city manager also to come to discuss with Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," No. So if we get a good place with the cooperation of the authorities, then our simple program is that, as Professor Judah has remarked, drug-addicted hippies, they have been turned into devotees. We shall invite anyone to come and chant thisHareKṛṣṇamantraand takeprasādamand we are... I began this movement in New York alone, and these boys gradually came to me, but my process was this: chanting and giving themprasādam.He is one of the original student. He was. So this process, very simple process, everyone will be able to accept it. Chant, dance, and takeprasādam.Within that process, everything is there. Then he will understand. They will read these books... They are practical examples. I am poor Indian, I did not bribe them neither I have money. (laughter) So now they have dedicated their life for this purpose. So I want to do it in a large scale."
Mayor,Yes.,Prabhupāda," But I have no money. So if the authorities give me a place, and for feeding them necessary foodstuff, then I am sure it will be successful. These two things I want. I don't want any charges for mymantra,no. Mymantrais open,HareKṛṣṇa, and there is no charge for it. And I have no necessity. I require a little clothing and twocapatis.That's all. Anyone can bring. I thought Chicago is one of the important cities of your country. And when I first came, I saw this is vacant. So I thought if this house can be utilized in the beginning and we invite anyone, especially young men, come here, live with us at least for one week and associate with this chanting, dancing, and we give niceprasādam.There is no difficulty. We can attempt. And if the authorities give us this facility at least for one year then we shall talk of permanent. They can see the result."
Mayor,"Would you use the facility, then, as sort of a center for all over the United States?",Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. We invite. As soon as they have got a leisure hour, let them come and live with us for one week and see the result. They can remain forever. It doesn't matter. But for experimental sake they can come, live with us and associate with us. It is not difficult. And we invite everyone. We have no such discrimination that black, white,Hindu, Muslim, Christian, no. Anyone. It is universal. Because we consider every living entity is part and parcel of God. That is a fact. We are teeny gods, part and parcel. The same quality we have got—in minute quantity. Quality is the same, quantity is less. So God is good, so we are also good. But we have become bad under circumstances. Just like under infection, one becomes diseased. So if we cure that infection, again he becomes good. So it is the curing process. It is not an external artificial thing, imposed upon somebody, no. His goodness is there. Just like generally a man is healthy, but by infecting some disease he becomes diseased. So this material way of life is a kind of infection. So we have to cure that. And this is our process. And it has become successful. So therefore this problem of your country... I was this morning also lecturing that ""You take up this movement very seriously and save your country."" And if you save America, means you save the whole world because others are following America. So you can do it very easily. That is my appeal to the authorities of the American administration. But I do not want anything. For your countrymen, for your misguided youthful generation, you have to do it. That is my request. Otherwise there is no other way."
Viṣṇujana,"According to national statistics, as far as curing drug problems and crime problems, it's seen that social organizations that are supported by the town councils, etc. are usually about 3% effective in cases cured of either drug addiction or crime. But as far as religious organizations are concerned, some of them are 70, 80% effective in cases that have been attempted cure. So it's, as far as percentage cured, the process of introducing God consciousness is much more effective than some social reform or rehabilitation work or something like that.",Prabhupāda," No, social reform will automatically come. The first-class reform, thebrāhmaṇas,if their advice is taken, then the other classes thekṣatriya, vaiśyas,andśūdras,they become automatically."
Mayor,"We're aware that a religious approach is more successful and our mental health society here is funding the Reverend Perry who is a black ordained, I think, a Baptist protestant minister, formerly a drug addict. And he's been working out with, especially with the blacks who have drug addiction and he achieves much more success than other agencies.",Prabhupāda, Which process? Drug addiction has been helped by somebody?
Brahmānanda,"No, the mayor's saying that the administration is not against supporting religious organizations.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,He gives the example of one religious organization.,Prabhupāda," This is everything. Religious, social, political, philanthropical, science, everything included. We can give advice for solving any problem. That we have got all these books, practical. And in India there is political problem. Everywhere it is going on. They do not follow the standard way. Who will be the politicians? Here is the..., described. What are the politicians? Second-class, they are taken second-class. What is that?Śauryatejaḥ?"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"""Heroism...""",Prabhupāda," Heroism, yes.Śauryatejaḥ..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Śauryaṁtejodhṛtirdākṣyam[Bg.18.43].,Prabhupāda," Ah, read this, read..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yuddhecāpyapalāyanam.,Prabhupāda," Yuddhecāpalāyanam.Akṣatriyashould be so trained up, when there is fight, he must come out, forward. Not that he will sit down in his secluded place and poor man will fight. No. He should come forward as leader, ""Come on."" That iskṣatriyaquality,yuddhecāpalāyanam.Formerly there was fight, but the leaders, they would come face to face first of all. And if the leader, one of the leader is killed-yuddhameans one party must be vanquished, fight—then the war is finished. The main person, chief person is now killed, so there is no more war. Soyuddhecāpalāyanam.Those who are taking part in administration, in politics, they must be of this quality, very chivalrous, brave. They have to learn all these quality. Just like the first-class men, they are being trained up in self-controlling, controlling the mind, controlling the senses. And these second-class men, they should be trained up how to fight. Because fight will there be. We do not place this bogus idea that there will be no fight. No. Then fight will be there so long the human society is there. But what for one should fight? That training should be there. Not unnecessarily. In the history of India we find there were two fights: one withRāvaṇaand another theKurukṣetrafight. [break] Not at the whims of the leaders. He has got some idea and declare war and engage people. He is safe, now the people are dying. Therefore these leaders, this administration, they require to be guided by the first-class men. So everything will be possible, provided our, this heart is cleansed. And that can be done by this propagation of thisHareKṛṣṇamovement. Then everything will be automatically done. So my request is that if we get some encouragement from the authorities, we can push this movement little more vigorously. Otherwise we have no source. We simply sell our books, and whatever we get by that, we maintain ourself, we publish again books, or we open new center. There is no encouragement from the authorities. [break] But very important movement. And try to understand it and if possible help us."
Mayor,All right.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is our request. Bringprasāda.If you have got any further enquiry, I can try to..."
Mayor,"No, I really don't think I do, and I think I'd like to learn more about your movement too. But I have enjoyed having to talk and listen to you and I appreciate it.",Prabhupāda," No, put it here. He'll take. Take thisprasāda.They are all fruits, innocent. In your country you have got so many nice fruits."
Mayor,"Yes, we do.",Prabhupāda," Yes. And grains and milk. So much nice things. You can avoid meat-eating very easily, as they have given up."
Mayor; Viṣṇujana,"It looks very good, but I (indistinct) with a knife. (laughter); Someone is bringing a fork. Prabhupāda, perhaps we could provide him with some of our literature and that will inform him more about our movement.",Prabhupāda," Yes, give him."
Mayor,"All right, thank you.",Prabhupāda," So,Jagadīśa, you give whatever... You take his... Give him some fork."

And we'll be putting on our program right there in the park. We'll be chanting with our simple instruments. We'll want to serve some simple vegetarian, like a drink and some fruit, and discuss this philosophy amongst young people. We find that very successful all over the colleges in the country. And we think that around the Great Lakes here it will be very successful.",Prabhupāda," Now, we want this house just to keep them for sometimes with our association. That is temporary, for one hour or two hours, but I wish they should come and live with us for some time. Then it will be effective, more effective. That is... Therefore I wanted a house like this."

TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Yes. They're in a position. They have many such buildings, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"If not this building, they could give an alternate building.",Prabhupāda, Yes. But this is very good building. We can keep five hundred men.
TamālaKṛṣṇa; Bhavānanda,They also seem to have their eyes on it. (Prabhupāda laughs); This is a very wealthy community.,Prabhupāda," Oh, wealthy community. So invite all the young men to come and live with us for some time, and simply chanting, dancing, and give themprasādam.And if they like, they can read the books. Give this chance."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Prabhupāda? Of course, it would be beneficial if we had such a big building, but why can't we do it with the present building?",Prabhupāda, We cannot accommodate many men there.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,But at least we should be able to attract them.,Prabhupāda," Then you do this. Do this. This is the only means to save. Otherwise,kalaunāstyevanāstyevanāstyevagatiranyathā.There is no other second alternative."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"The point I am bringing up, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that just like the program you're proposing, practically speaking...",Prabhupāda, My idea is I want to draw the attention of the authorities.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Oh.,Prabhupāda," You see? If they cooperate, then we can push on our movement more vigorously."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,So with our present location here we cannot...,Prabhupāda," No, no, that you can do in a larger scale."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I see.,Prabhupāda," We are doing it. In a small scale it is going on, but if we get some support of the authorities, we can push on in larger scale."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is the idea. We are not going to stop for anything. We are going on with our movement.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,No. So the point is we need a larger scale...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"And we need help from the government.; Yes, right.",Prabhupāda," And if there is good result, then government will... Just like they have thought Maharishi's movement is..."

Ghanaśyāma,"Oh, yes, cultivating very nice. The president there, he is taking out thesaṅkīrtanaparty himself, and the whole temple has become very enthused by this. Bury Place.",Prabhupāda, How many devotees are there?
Ghanaśyāma,"Bury Place, there's about... There are three travelingsaṅkīrtanaparties. There are about maybe thirty devotees there.",Prabhupāda, Ācchā.And Bhaktivedanta Manor?
Ghanaśyāma,I think about maybe thirty-five. Some of the boys go to Scotland frequently. So they sort of share the devotees with the three temples.,Prabhupāda, Edinburgh. So you have been in Edinburgh University?
Ghanaśyāma,"No. I don't know. Prabhupāda, they have a program there with the Indians. The Indians are supporting the temple there now.",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Ghanaśyāma,"The Indians, they're paying for the devotees'prasādamand supporting the temple.",Prabhupāda," Ah, yes.Anna-dāna."
Ghanaśyāma,"They make vows to give a certain amount to help the devotees out every week. They have a big chart. One Indian might make a vow that he will pay for all the wheat or all the breakfastprasādafor the devotees for that month, and he'll give that much money. (Prabhupāda laughs) It's very nice. They kind of compete with each other to see who's doing the most. They go out and make life members. They make, sometimes, five, six life members in one day.",Prabhupāda, So we shall go further? Our time is up.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,6:30 now.,Prabhupāda," Oh, then we must go. [break] Hm."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Sometimes we have heard thatekādaśīis a inauspicious alignment of the planets and therefore one has to counteract this inauspiciousness by more chanting.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) No, no. It is the most auspicious. And chanting is more effective. [break] Yes."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,I remember you were instructing once that all of your initiated disciples should chant twenty-five rounds...,Prabhupāda, Minimum.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Minimum on this day. Is that a rule that we should all follow in our temples?,Prabhupāda, We are sixteen rounds.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"No, I mean onekādaśī.",Prabhupāda," Oh yes.Ekādaśī,simply you should chant. No other business.Nirjala."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,No preaching work? Should they go out for preaching?,Prabhupāda," No, those who are preaching, not for them. Those who are sitting idle, or they... (laughter) [break] ...has no other regulation, simply preaching. A preacher is so exalted. He hasn't got to follow any regulation. But don't take it. (laughter) And actually if one is busy in preaching work, that is first-class. [break] ...not my manufactured word, myGuruMahārāja, that the... ThatMādhavaMahārāja, when he was abrahmacārī,his name wasHayagrīva. So he was to go somewhere. So but he was sick.GuruMahārājawas informed that he was sick and ""Today isekādaśī.He cannot take his regular meals."" SoGuruMahārājasaid, ""No. Let him take immediately meals and go."""
Revatīnandana; TamālaKṛṣṇa,For preaching. [break]; ...Mahārājawould sacrifice everything for preaching.,Prabhupāda," Oh yes. [break] He was not pleased with BonMahārāja, He could not do anything. [break]"
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"...most pleased with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We must be sure of that.",Prabhupāda," Unless he is pleased, what I am worth? It is due to his pleasure. Otherwise what I am worth? Everyone says, ""You have done wonderful."" What can I do wonderful? It is by his pleasure it is going on.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādaḥ**.[break] BonMahārājahas written that, last line?"
Brahmānanda; TamālaKṛṣṇa,That your accomplishment has been very great. He had to admit. (Prabhupāda laughs); He admitted it publicly.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) No. He has written me a letter. I invited him. [break] Now, he has returned."
TamālaKṛṣṇa; ŚrīGovinda,"Oh, he has returned. (end); Lt. Mozee.",Prabhupāda, Hm. Yes.
ŚrīGovinda,"He's with the Chicago police department, and he's in charge of developing their relationship with the media. And I was thinking there could be nice discussion with him concerning your ideas about stopping crime.",Prabhupāda, Hm? Yes. So I shall explain or he will enquire?
Jayatīrtha; Lt. Mozee,"Would you like to ask some questions or have him explain?; Well, no, I understand the spiritual leader had some ideas on how to prevent crime, how to do these things. I might inquire after he gives his ideas. I understand you read the...",Prabhupāda," It is not idea, it is fact that one man is very pious and one man is very vicious. What is the difference? The difference is: one is dirty in his heart and one is pure in his heart. So if you keep people dirty, then there will be crimes. This is the sign that the general people, they are dirty. So you have to purify the dirty things, diseased condition. Then things will be all right. So our simplest process is to assemble in congregation and chant the holy name of God. Then dirty things will go away. So if you want to stop crime, then you have to arrange for masssaṅkīrtana.That is our movement. Gather people as large as can be possible and congregationally chant the holy name of God. Then it will be all right."
Lt. Mozee,Do you have any feeling about the crime here in the United States as opposed to the crime in your own land?,Prabhupāda," Crime, what is your definition of crime?"
Lt. Mozee,Any infraction against one person by another person. Any trampling on the rights of one person by another person can be a crime or should be a crime.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Our definition is the same in theUpaniṣad,that everything belongs to God. As you think everything belongs to the state, we think everything belongs to God. So you can utilize your possession, what is alloted to you. Don't encroach upon others. So people are not thinking in that way. First beginning is that you Americans, you are thinking this America land is your, although two hundred years ago it was not your. You have come from other parts of the world. Now you are claiming it is your land. But actually it is God's land. So God's land belongs to everyone. Everyone is God's children. That is our broad conception.Īśāvāsyamidaṁsarvam: [Īśomantra1]""Everything belongs to God."" So people have no conception of God. Everyone is practically godless. Therefore they should be educated about God. Just like the Communists. They are educating godlessness. Similarly... Just like in America they say, your government says, ""We trust in God."" Is it not?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," But where is the education about God? Simply, trust is also good, very good, but simple trust will not endure unless you know scientifically what is God. Everyone knows that he has got a father, but he does not know who is his father. That knowledge is not perfect. Everyone who is born in this material world must have a father, but that is not sufficient suggestion. One must know who is father. That education is lacking."
Lt. Mozee,"Do you feel, sir, that it is lacking only here in the United States?",Prabhupāda, Everywhere.
Lt. Mozee,Everywhere.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everywhere. This is the age of forgetting God. We say it isKali-yuga.Kali-yugameans the age of misunderstanding. And that is, I said, dirty things within the heart. So God is so powerful that if we chant the holy name of God, then we become purified. So our movement is based on this principle, chant the holy name of God. We give all facilities to everyone without any distinction that ""You come with us. Come in our temple, chantHareKṛṣṇamantra,and take littleprasādam,refreshment, and gradually you become purified."" So if the government authorities give us facilities for this business, that we hold masssaṅkīrtana,HareKṛṣṇa, and give them littleprasādam,then we are sure the whole place will change."
Lt. Mozee,"If I understand you then correctly, sir, you would say that the emphasis should be returned to the religious aspects.",Prabhupāda," Certainly. Without religious aspect what is the difference between dog and man? Man can be turned to be a religious man, the dog cannot be. That is the difference between dog and man. So if you keep the human society to the status of dogs and cats, how you can expect peaceful society? If you bring one dozen of dogs and if you want to keep them peacefully, is it possible? So if we keep human society as dogs, then how you can expect peacefulness?"
Lt. Mozee,"Some of my questions might sound disrespectful. If they do it is only because I do not understand completely your religious beliefs, and I mean no disrespect whatsoever.",Prabhupāda," No, it is not my religious belief. I am just giving you general description of religious life and animal life. The animal cannot be taken to the churches and teach something about God. It is not possible. But a human being can be. So if the human being is refused this facility, then you keep them as cats and dogs. And you cannot expect any peaceful condition of life in the society of cats and dogs. So therefore it is the duty of the authority, of the government, of the elderly person, father, guardian, to teach the subordinate how to become God conscious. Otherwise, there will be trouble because there is no difference between dogs and man in every respect. The dog eats, we eat. The dog sleeps, we sleep. The dog have sex, we have sex. The dog also tries to defend itself, we also try to defend ourself. These are common factors. The only difference is the dog cannot be instructed about his relation with God, but man can be instructed."
Lt. Mozee,"It would seem to me that in the days that we live in, I would say that the wolf, the animal, wolf, has more peacefulness than man. The wolf does not encroach upon another's territory...",Prabhupāda, Then you can say a stone has got more peacefulness than man.
Lt. Mozee,In today's society.,Prabhupāda," Yes, you keep a stone a stone. That's all right. Wolf may be qualified with peacefulness, but after all, it is animal. You cannot say because it is peaceful for the time being, therefore it is not animal. It is animal."
Lt. Mozee,Wouldn't that sort of peace be a precursor to a return to religion? Must we not first have peace?,Prabhupāda," No, no. That is the difficulty. We do not know the meaning of religion. At the present moment the human society does not know what is the meaning of religion. The meaning of religion is to abide by the laws of God, just like a good citizen means who abides by the laws of the state, of the government. Because we have no understanding of God, therefore we do not know what is the laws of God, and therefore we do not know what is religion. That is the present status of the human society. They are forgetting religion. They take religion as a kind of faith. Faith may be blind faith. Faith is not the real description of religion. Religion means the laws which is given by God, and anyone who follows the laws, he is religious. It doesn't matter whether he is a Christian or aHinduor Muslim. If he follows the laws of God, then he is religious."
Lt. Mozee,"Again I say I mean no disrespect, but in India, where the religious customs have been followed for centuries upon centuries, we are seeing a, not a return, but we are seeing a drawing away. We are seeing a drawing away from the spiritual world and the spiritual life in today's society.",Prabhupāda," Yes, it is due to bad leadership. Otherwise, Indian mass of people, they are fully conscious of God and they try to follow the laws of God, the mass of people. Here even the big, big professor, they do not believe in God, they do not believe in next life. But India, even the poorest man, he knows that ""There is God. There is next life. If I commit sinful life I will suffer. If I live piously, then I shall enjoy."" Even the low-grade society, social man, he believes it. Still if there is some disagreement, the village people go to the temple for settlement, and the opposite parties will hesitate to speak lies before the temple, still. So in that respect India is still 80 percent religious, 80 percent religious. That is the special privilege of taking birth in India. That is a fact."
Lt. Mozee,"Sir, do you think that the wealth of the United States and some certain other countries would be a block to spiritual faith? In Christianity there is a parable that ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to come before the throne of God."" Would wealth in itself be a block toward spiritual awareness?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Too much wealthy condition is a block. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā, bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁtayāpahṛta-cetasām.If one is very materially opulent, he forgets God. Therefore, to be too much materially rich is a disqualification for understanding God. Although there is no more impediment, that ""Only the poor man will understand God and rich man will not understand,"" it is not that. But generally, if one is extraordinarily rich or his one aim is only to acquire money, it is difficult for him to understand God.Bhogaiśvarya...Find out this verse,"
Jayatīrtha,"Christ says that ""The meek shall inherit the earth.""",Prabhupāda, Hmm?
Jayatīrtha,"""The meek shall inherit the earth."" Because they're meek therefore everything will come to them.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Brahmānanda; Lt. Mozee,"; Um hm. Well, those who believe in our country in Christianity believe these things. I don't see the vast differences between the spiritual belief of one religious group as opposed to another.",Prabhupāda," We don't say that. We don't say that. We say that you follow any religious system. Doesn't matter. But you understand God and love Him. That is our propaganda. We do not say that ""You are Christian. This is not good. You come here."" We do not say. Why say? Everything is... But our proposition is that either you are Christian or Muslim orHindu, it doesn't matter. You understand God and love Him, that's all."
Lt. Mozee,"I recognize, sir, that your time is very valuable and I won't delay you much longer. If I could return to my original purpose for coming in the..., what words you may have that would assist us, my superintendent and my department, in the reduction of crime, other than, I recognize, that the first and the foremost way would be a return to God as you said, that there is no doubt about that. But is there something else that you may know or that you may feel that you may be able to say that would assist us in a reduction less than the ideal?",Prabhupāda," Yes. That I have already in the beginning said, that give us facilities, the authorities, to chant the holy name of God and distributeprasādam.Prasādammeans..."
Lt. Mozee,"Yes, I understand.",Prabhupāda," ...some refreshment as remnants of foodstuff of God. Then it will make tremendous change. I came from India alone; now I have got so many followers. So what did I do? I did the same thing. I asked them to sit down, and chantHareKṛṣṇamantra,and distribute them littleprasādam.This should be done in a mass scale, and then things will become very peaceful. It is fact. So I want little cooperation of the authorities to give me the facility, how I can call many men together, chant togetherHareKṛṣṇamantra,and I supply them little refreshment, that's all."
Lt. Mozee,I will definitely convey your message to my superiors.,Prabhupāda, So you give us this facility.
Lt. Mozee,Where would you...? Do you have any ideas where you would want...?,Prabhupāda," Yes, yesterday the mayor of this place came. Here is a house vacant. So if we get this house, then we can begin in a mass scale. The America is not poor. So at least on experimental stage the government or the municipality can give us this house and arrange for someprasādam.Simpleprasādawe give, not costly. We don't use meat or anything."
Lt. Mozee,"Yes, sir.",Prabhupāda," Vegetable, grains, that's all. But something must be given. This is our program. So I saw yesterday the mayor. He came also very kindly. And you have come. So you consult yourself. This place or any place, give us some facility and see the result."
Lt. Mozee,Would you say that it should be done in an area of affluence or an area of poverty to begin with?,Prabhupāda," No, we have no distinction, such, but a place which is easily available for all kinds of men, that is very nice. There is no such condition that the only poor man will take benefit and the rich man, they do not require. Everyone requires. Do you think that the criminality is only in the poorer section?"
Lt. Mozee,"Oh, no.",Prabhupāda," Then? Everyone is a criminal, either he is a poor man or rich man. So we should not make such distinction, that only it is meant for the poor man."
Lt. Mozee,"No, the distinction I was attempting to draw was would there be more benefit, would there be more of an influence, or would there be more of a strengthening if it were in an area of affluence rather than an area of poverty or vice versa?",Prabhupāda," No, no, no, that's... Our treatment is for the diseased person. So diseased person does not make any distinction of poor man and rich man. Rich man is also diseased, and poor man is also diseased, and everyone should be admitted in the hospital. So hospital should be in such a place where the poor man and rich man, both of them can come because all of them are diseased. So when one comes to the hospital there is no such thing as a poor man's hospital or rich man's. Hospital is hospital. And everyone being diseased, everyone should take advantage. But the difficulty is, as we are quoting the passage, that rich man, he thinks that he is not diseased. Although he is diseased number one, but he thinks that he is not diseased. That is the difficulty of the rich man. But we are thinking everyone is diseased. And you know better than me being police. There are criminality amongst rich men and poor men alike."
Lt. Mozee,"Oh, yes.",Prabhupāda," So our process is to cleanse the heart, not the opulence or poverty. No, that is not our... To cleanse the heart. If the poor man is cleansed in his heart he will not touch anybody's property. I heard that King, Emperor Edward VII, his habit was to steal."
Lt. Mozee,"Yes, he was a kleptomaniac. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," And I have known many instances. In Calcutta one very rich man's son in the evening he would take his bath and dress nicely, and he would go to the Howrah station and beg, cheat men: ""I have lost my purse. Will you kindly help me?"" And any gentleman: ""He has lost..."" And he will go to the restaurant and eat and go home. That was his habit. He was a very rich man, but his habit was this. So we have to change the habit by changing the heart. You know very well. Many thieves, they have committed many times theft and put into the jail. So he knows that ""If I commit theft, I will go to the jail."" He has practically seen it, and he knows it. Still, he steals. Why? Because heart is unclean. So this process will cleanse the heart. Unless he cleans the heart, you cannot stop criminality simply by laws. Laws are already known. The professional thief, he knows the law. The professional murderer, he knows the law. But still, he commits because heart is unclean. And our process, to cleanse the heart.Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12],it is Sanskrit, ""Cleansing the heart.""Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam,""Then all the troubles of this material world will be solved."""
Lt. Mozee,"A very difficult task, sir.",Prabhupāda," It is not difficult, very simple task. To ask them ""Please come here, chantHareKṛṣṇa, dance, and take sumptuouslyprasādam,go home""—where is the difficulty? And they are coming; we are doing that. But we are doing—because we have no money—we are doing on a small scale. But if the government gives us facility we can expand this scale. That's all. We are collecting money... Of course we are doing our business by selling these books. We have got many books. And we are inviting men; they are coming, and gradually increasing. There is no dearth of men or devotees. But the government is faced with these difficulties, ""Crime, why and what to do?"" So we are suggesting this: because they are unclean in their heart, therefore there is crime and take this process, it will be successful. This is our... They are faced with the problem, ""Why crime and what to do?"" And we are giving the answer. So you take advantage of it. Why? We are saying, ""Because they are godless."" And what to do? ChantHareKṛṣṇaand takeprasādam.Now, if you like, you can take. Otherwise, we are doing our own business. Just like a poor medical man. He is also giving medicine. But if he is given facility, he can open a big hospital. So that is our proposition. We are already doing that business. But if we get facility from the authorities then we can open a big place, a big hospital. And the problem is already big. Otherwise, why they are saying, ""What to do?"""
Lt. Mozee,"Well, there are...",Prabhupāda," No civil state wants this criminality. That's a fact. But they do not know how to stop it. That we can suggest. We are good advisor. Now, the government is the executor. So if they take our advice and execute it, then things will be done nicely."
Lt. Mozee,"There are countless numbers in the United States of large facilities of the Christian faith, and, like you, they give the refreshment of the holy communion. Why does this not work? Why is this not cleansing the heart?",Prabhupāda," The answer is... Then we come to the details. So you say, ""Christian,"" and I find to find out a Christian. I find difficulty to find out one Christian. I must frankly say, because the so-called Christians, they do not abide by theBible'sorder that in the Christian'sBibleit is said, ""Thou shall not kill."" and where is a Christian who does not kill? So this can be effective only persons who are practicing religion. So these persons, they are trained to practice. So their chanting of the holy name of God and others' are different. [break] It is not simply a rubber stamp position. It must be practiced, realized. This chanting of holy name by our men who are trained up and the same chanting by others will be different. Of course, if you... [break] ...yourHinduprinciple. That is secular state, not to remain callous: ""Whatever you like you can do. We have no concern to see."" That is not government's duty."
Lt. Mozee,"Sir, isn't the difficulty, rather, that the group of, I want to call them, hard-coregroup, the priests, the devotees, the followers, the little circle of people, have always been the ones that have followed the practices, but the fringe... Assume for example thatHareKṛṣṇagrew to gigantic proportions as Christianity has grown. Would not it be the problem that the fringe areas, the ones who were not, who professed to be the followers... Would not they be the difficulty as the Christian is today? You have said that you...",Prabhupāda," Yes, that possibility is always there. But my proposal is that if you are not true Christian, then your preaching will not be effective. I don't say that now we are strictly following and we will not fall down in future. I don't say that. That fall down propensity, tendency is always there. But my proposal is that unless one is strictly follower of the principles, his preaching will not be effective. That is my charge."
Lt. Mozee,"Yes. Well sir, again I thank you for your time. I thank you for this interview. And I thank you for the opportunity to find out more about the group that isHareKṛṣṇa. And I will deliver this tape recording to my superiors. Hopefully, hopefully it will be effective...",Prabhupāda, Thank you.
