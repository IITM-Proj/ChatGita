Guest,"Yet no two are the same, are they?",Prabhupāda, Eh.
Guest,They are not the same.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Varieties. Everything is variety. Everything is variety, full of varieties. We find the same species ofrose. Still, you'll find varieties. In human, twin brothers you will find still varieties."
Guest,"And inGolokaVṛndāvana, are there still varieties? Are there still varieties inVṛndāvana?",Prabhupāda, Vṛndāvana?
Śrutakīrti,"GolokaVṛndāvana, are there still varieties he said.",Prabhupāda," Oh yes. There are varieties.Ānanda,ānanda,pleasure means varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. Without varieties, just like we prepare from grains, sugar, ghee, hundreds of varieties. If you simply give grain, ghee and sugar, it will not be enjoyable. But the same thing, you prepare in varieties and give you a plate, oh, you'll say, ""Oh, so nice thing."" The ingredients are the same. Grains, ghee and sugar, that's all. Similarly, this material world, the ingredients are the same. Namely five gross elements and three subtle elements, finer. Earth, water, air, fire, sky. These are gross elements. And mind, intelligence, ego these are finer elements. Combined together this material world has come. The brain behind is a living entity. Just like we are using these ingredients, these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, sky, making this building, making this table, making this chair,vase, so many things, harmonium, pictures, book. So the ingredients are the same, but my brain is working in different varieties. My brain or your brain. Human brain. Similarly this material cosmic manifestation is full of varieties. The brain behind it isKṛṣṇa. That is stated, you have read ourBhagavad-gītā?"
Guest,I've taken a look.,Prabhupāda, There is a verse. Find out:
Guest,"Is modern science materialism, Prabhupāda? Is it materialism?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"All, all materialism?",Prabhupāda," Just dealing with earth, water, air, fire, sky. That's all."
Guest,"And in this time, modern science, you know, physics, chemistry, mathematics; is this all materialism?",Prabhupāda, All materialism.
Guest,All materialism.,Prabhupāda, They do not know what is spiritual.
Guest,"And inside these people doing this work, is itKṛṣṇa? Or what is it makes them do the work?",Prabhupāda," No. The soul is a living being. So nature is supplying material and he's molding in different forms. Just like earth is not man's creation. Earth is God's creation, or it is product of God's energy. But we are using this earth and molding in different forms, different pots, different dolls. So ingredients are supplied by God. Nature means God's energy. We simply handle them. We cannot produce anything, we transform only. Just like this iron, we cannot produce iron. It is gotten from the mine, iron bar. Now we have transformed into different forms. Because we have got creative energy like God, not very great, in very minute quantity. So as God has created by His intelligence, the whole universe—we are creating this table, this pillow, this harmonium—that's all. What you are finding?"
Śrutakīrti,I was just looking at that verse again.,Prabhupāda, Which verse?
Śrutakīrti,Mayādhyakṣeṇa...,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Guest,Because one man says one thing and one man says another thing. So many people have different things to say.,Prabhupāda," No, personally. Suppose I ask you. What is your, you want to ask me?"
Haṁsadūta,"You have, that letter has a return address from Maṇḍalībhadra?",Prabhupāda," Yes, it is here. Now the water... Just like from your body, water is produced, is it not?"
Guest,Transformed?,Prabhupāda," Transformed or whatever, but you see urine is coming, perspiration is coming. So these different waters are produced by your energy within the body. So why not from God's energy the vast water?"
Guest,"Yes, truly.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,But why should he give us...,Prabhupāda," Because God is unlimited, He has got unlimited energy. have got limited energy. I can pass urine, say one pound, I can have perspiration say, one ounce but if God likes He can produce unlimited water. Why this one Atlantic Ocean? Many millions of Atlantic Oceans He can produce. Water produced from His body. So where is the difficulty to understand? WhenKṛṣṇasays that the elements... Other matters are growing. Just like the hair. Now, today, I have shaved. Three days after, again it will grow. So I have got my energy within by which I'm constantly growing. But, hair is a material thing. So anything you take, it grows from the Supreme. It is very easy to understand."
Guest,"Hmm. And ah, this inside, it grows because ofKṛṣṇadoes it?",Prabhupāda," Everything is growing on account ofKṛṣṇa. Your body, inside or outside, it is made of these five elements: earth, water, air, fire, like that. It is nothing but combination of these five elements."
Guest,Is the water inside the same as the water in the ocean?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,It's the same water.,Prabhupāda, Yes. You... Have you tasted ever perspiration?
Guest,Hmm?,Prabhupāda," Perspiration, have you tasted?"
Guest,"Tasted it, yes, salt.",Prabhupāda," Salt, yes."
Guest,"Ocean, yes.",Prabhupāda, It has got.
Guest,But one ocean is not the same as another eh? My business is mathematics. It's not very transcendental.,Prabhupāda, You are teacher?
Guest; Śrutakīrti,"No, not anymore. It's not very transcendental.; He's asking if his business is transcendental.",Prabhupāda," No, if it is used forKṛṣṇa, then it is transcendental. If it is used for your sense gratification, then it is material. That is the difference."
Guest,Yes. And how do you know whether you're using it forKṛṣṇaor not?,Prabhupāda," Yes. That requires training from the Kṛṣṇa's representative,guru. Just like these boys are being trained up inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So it requires little training. Just like you are mathematician. To make another student mathematician, you have to train him. You have to teach him how to calculate two plus two equal to four. It will never be five. If somebody says, ""No, my calculation is two plus two equal to five."" Will it be accepted?"
Guest,I'm afraid sometimes it can be true. (laughs),Prabhupāda, How it can be true?
Guest,One plus one can equal three.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,One plus one can equal three sometimes.,Prabhupāda, Is there mathematical calculation?
Guest,"I know that it's ah... I mean things reproduce. Life is not so fixed, not so rigid. But one does have to be trained, it's true. Training is, some people can understand and some people cannot understand.",Prabhupāda, That is difference of understanding.
Guest,Yes.,Prabhupāda," The fact is true. But if I cannot understand, that is my misfortune."
Guest,"Yes. And if I can't understand what this is the end of the... So yes, it's the same. I think this is right.",Prabhupāda," God is fact. But if somebody cannot understand, it is his misfortune."
Guest,"Yes. And another time, another place.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"As you say, there are many oceans. The Christians say, ""In my father's house are many mansions."" A Chair. (indistinct) Good enough?",Prabhupāda," No, you can sit down."
Guest,"This has come a long way from the Barrier Reef, the Pacific. These shells. The shells.",Prabhupāda, Oh yes.
Guest,"From the Pacific. From the Barrier Reef, Australia. You know the Barrier Reef?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,"Yes, that's where they come from, the Barrier Reef.",Prabhupāda, I have seen the reef.
Guest,You have?,Prabhupāda, In Australia.
Guest,"Oh, yes. I would like to see that. The sea is wonderful, isn't it? You like the sea they tell me.",Prabhupāda," Oh yes. Very green, clear."
Guest,Always a different color though. Always a little different isn't it?,Prabhupāda," Well, reef I have seen. It is about, not less than two hundred feet."
Guest,"Really? They say under the water is beautiful, the light, and the color.",Prabhupāda, They go under the water?
Guest,"They go, yes, under the water, in skin-diving. The coral, coral? Grows coral doesn't it? They say it's all, very beautiful.Jaya.Well, thank you, Prabhupāda,jaya.",Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa. Give himprasāda.Thank you.
Śrutakīrti,Take a little sweet.,Prabhupāda, What is your name?
Guest,Peter.,Prabhupāda," Peter, oh yes."
Guest,Thank you very much.,Prabhupāda, Jaya.(end)
Guest (1) (Indian man); Prabhupāda.; Guest (1),"...Yes, yes. I ask him why, after such a long lapse of time we could see this trait ofHindudharma.; Yes. NotHindudharma.; Or Vedicdharma.",Prabhupāda," ...but spiritual, satisfaction of spiritual starvation. Because we are spiritual beings. That I was trying to explain. That we have bodily necessities, at the same time we have spiritual necessities. This Western civilization, they are simply after the bodily necessities. Just like here is a qualified medical man. He's made... What for, medical man? He knows how to satisfy the medical necessities of the body. He has no information of the spirit soul. Is it not a fact? Have you got any idea what is spirit soul?"
Guest (2) (Indian Doctor),"Not from the medical knowledge, certainly not.",Prabhupāda," Therefore I say that these universities, educational institution, all over the world, they are simply concerned with this body. According to our Vedic culture, to remain satisfied with the bodily necessities of life is the business of animals.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13]."
Guest (1),"What is God to a layman, like me.",Prabhupāda," Layman, well, layman means, we already explained, he's no better than animal. Because layman means one who thinks that ""I am this body."" He's layman. He has no other information. So layman is equal to animal. So layman's education, layman's advancement is decoration of the dead body. If you decorate a dead body, you can feel satisfaction. But others will laugh, that ""What a fool he is, he's decorating a dead body?""Bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasyajātiḥśāstraṁjapastapaḥ, aprāṇasyevadehasyamaṇḍanaṁloka-rañjanam.Layman's business is decorating this dead body, that's all."
Guest (1),"Yeah, but if you were to explain to him what is God, how would you explain to him.",Prabhupāda," Then, suppose, what you are? What is your business? What do you do? You're teacher, what is the subject matter?"
Guest (1),I teach in law.,Prabhupāda," So if one wants to know what is law, he must become a student. It is not that simply asking ""What is law, sir?"" You can make him understand within a minute or within hour? Is it possible?"
Guest (1),No.,Prabhupāda," First of all, you must become graduate, then you should take entrance in the law college, then you must learn. So what is God, that is the inquiry, but it requires training. And that is Vedicdharma,varṇāśrama-dharma.Varṇāśrama-dharma. Varṇāśramācaravatāpuruṣeṇaparaḥpumān[Cc.Madhya8.58].Anyone who has taken to this system ofvarṇāśrama-dharma,fourvarṇas:brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra;and fourāśrama:brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.Unless one takes to this institutional education, he's no more than an animal. So to know God means he must become abrāhmaṇa,real, qualifiedbrāhmaṇa.Thereforebrāhmaṇais respected. Because,brahma-jānātītibrāhmaṇa.But there is no law. Lawless country. Therefore one is passing as abrāhmaṇawithout any knowledge ofBrahman. That is the defect. Formerly the government will see... I was explaining this, this morning. That it is the kṣatriya's duty to see that one is passing as abrāhmaṇa,whether he's qualified. Why he should pass? Suppose he says, ""I'm medical man."" He must be qualified. And if he says, ""I am medical man,"" then he's cheating. So you cannot call yourself abrāhmaṇaunless you are qualified. But that is going on. And this cheating is being accepted. Therefore thisvarṇāśrama-dharma.Hindudharmaor Vedicdharmameansvarṇāśrama-dharma.One must first of all accept the principles ofvarṇasandāśramas.Then there is question of understanding God. God is not so cheap thing, ""What is God?"" and you understand immediately. You must become first of allbrāhmaṇa."
Guest (1),So in order to understand what is God one has to leave his family and come to some...,Prabhupāda, Why do you surmise like that? You do not know what is God. Why do you surmise your proposal?
Guest (1),"No, I mean, ah...",Prabhupāda," Now why you are asking this question? You know, I've explained, that one has to becomebrāhmaṇa.There are still there are manybrāhmaṇas,those who are with children. EvenCaitanyaMahāprabhu, although He had no children, He was family man.NityānandaPrabhuwas family man, andAdvaitaPrabhuwas family man. They're allbrāhmaṇas,family men, but they knew what is God. The real thing is to know God. Not to, because everything is allowed. These eight, fourvarṇasand fourāśramas.There is no such thing that one has to become, to come to this form of life or that form of life. Sovarṇāśramācaravatā.You must execute thevarṇāśrama-dharma.Then you'll understand. It doesn't matter whether you are abrāhmaṇaorkṣatriyaorvaiśyaorśūdra,that is a cooperation. Just like in your body there must be the head, there must be the arms, there must be the belly, and there must be the legs. By comparative study head is more important than the leg. But leg is also required. You cannot do without leg. Similarly,brāhmaṇais the head,kṣatriyais the arms,vaiśyais the belly andśūdrais the leg. So as much I require my head so much I require the leg also. But the leg must do the leg's duty and the head must do the head's duty. Then it is perfect. And if the head is cracked, then everything is gone, madman. So at the present moment there is nobrāhmaṇa,qualified. Therefore the society is in chaos. In chaotic condition, all are searching after something substantial. That is the position of the Western countries. They have heard so many things about India's culture. Still, they respect India's culture, spiritual culture. They are hankering after. But unfortunately the so-called yogis, swamis, come and cheat them. That is the difficulty. This is the first time that systematically we are presenting what is actual VedicdharmaorBhāgavata-dharma.This question was raised byRāmānandaRāyabeforeCaitanyaMahāprabhu.Varṇāśrama,he quoted this verse fromViṣṇuPurāṇa.CaitanyaMahāprabhusaid,ehobāhya, āgekahaāra.""Yes, it is all right,varṇāśrama-dharma,but it is now external. If you know something better, you speak."" So in this way the whole system was discussed. At lastCaitanyaMahāprabhuapproved this system ofśravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁviṣṇoḥ[SB7.5.23].Chanting and hearing aboutViṣṇu.Varṇāśrama-dharmais alsoViṣṇu.Viṣṇurārādhyate.The real purpose is understandingViṣṇuthe Supreme. Sovarṇāśrama-dharmais also meant for understandingViṣṇu.Viṣṇurārādhyate.So... But these formulas ofbrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,it is the, the age is so rotten that it is very difficult to revive thisvarṇāśrama-dharmaculture. ThereforeCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid,ehobāhya, āgekahaāra.Yes, it is all right, but it is external now. It cannot be utilized at the present moment. So whenRāmānandaRāyastated, citing one verse fromŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam:sthānesthitāḥśruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiryeprāyaśo 'jita jito 'pyasitaistri-lokyām.If one simply hears aboutViṣṇu, never mind in whatever condition he is, then he can understand what is God.Sthānesthitāḥśruti-gatām. Śruti-gatāmmeans hearing. Receiving from the ear.Śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.And in that way if he engages his body, his words,tanu-vāk,mind, then, although LordViṣṇuisAjita, nobody can conquer Him, he can conquer. He can understand what isViṣṇu, what is His function, what is my relationship with Him. All these things can be understood. Therefore we are propagating the same principle. We do not ask anyone: ""First of all, you becomebrāhmaṇa.Then come here."" No. Let him come and hear aboutViṣṇu. We speak, discuss aboutBhagavad-gītā.They hear. They hearŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.You have seen our books? So these books are discussed and gradually... If it is a fact,śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ,if one gives only aural reception to this transcendental message, then, although God isAjita, nobody can conquer, He becomes conquered. So that is becoming, happening, that although they are American, European, Canadian, African, Australian, not all of them are Indian... Indians are also there. But because they are giving aural reception to this transcendental message, they are becoming enlightened. So anyone who will give aural reception to this message, first of allBhagavad-gītā,entrance, thenBhāgavatam,thenCaitanya-caritāmṛta,like books, then gradually, he'll be self-realized, fully cognizant what is God. What is God, this is...athātobrahmajijñāsāmeans what is God. So this institution is meant for giving chance to everyone to hear. It doesn't require education. Simply God has given him this ear. Let him receive the message from the ear.Śruti-gatāṁtanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.This is the process. Very simple process. Simply to hear, sincerely, then everything will be done gradually.CaitanyaMahāprabhuhas said,ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam[Cc.Antya20.12].By hearing, the mirror of consciousness, consciousness is just like a mirror. It is now covered with dust.Mārjanam.Mirror, if you cleanse with a duster, then you can see clearly what is your face. So by this chanting process and hearing, gradually the dirty things in the heart will be cleansed.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ[SB1.2.17].Simply hearing aboutKṛṣṇaispuṇya,pious activities.Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.Either you hear or you chant.Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ. Hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi.There are so many dirty things, nonsense things, within the heart.Hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi,vidhunoti,is washed.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.Who is...? Find out this verse.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.In the First Canto, first part, Third Chapter. Where isPaṇḍitaMahārāja? Call him.Śṛṇvatām,you can find out in the index."
Śrutakīrti,S-i?,Prabhupāda, Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.
Śrutakīrti,S-i-n?,Prabhupāda, R.Sva-kathāḥ.Yes. What...
Śrutakīrti,Sva-pathaḥ?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.You are not learning, onlyPaṇḍitaGosāñiis required. Where isPaṇḍitaGosāñi?"
Śrutakīrti; Guest (1),He went to...; Can I have a look at it please?,Prabhupāda," Yes, give him.Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥpuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdyantaḥstho hyabhadrāṇi[SB1.2.17].(speaks some Bengali. Asks some Indians if they know Bengali, where they are from.)"
Śrutakīrti,It's not in the Third Chapter.,Prabhupāda," Let me see. First Canto, where it is?"
Śrutakīrti,S-i?,Prabhupāda, S-r.
Śrutakīrti,"S-r,śṛṇ,oh.",Prabhupāda, Śṛṇvatāṁsva-kathāḥkṛṣṇaḥ.You could not find? Here it is.
Śrutakīrti,I was looking s-i.,Prabhupāda, Find out.
Śrutakīrti,107 Second Chapter.,Prabhupāda," Second Chapter, Second Chapter, seventeenth verse, yes."
Śrutakīrti,,Prabhupāda, Vidhunotisuhṛtsatām.What is the meaning?
Śrutakīrti,"""ŚrīKṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is theParamātmā, Supersoul, in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.""",Prabhupāda," This is the process. If you hear aboutKṛṣṇa, thenKṛṣṇais within yourself.Īśvaraḥsarva-bhūtānāṁhṛd-deśe'rjunatiṣṭhati[Bg.18.61].When he sees you are anxious, then he helps you in cleansing the dirty things within your heart. Purport read?"
Guest (2),"I don't know actually. I'm a doc. I'm trying to find some answer but what difference does it make? Suppose a person thinks of God all his life and dies, and a person who doesn't think of God at all also dies. What is our life after death?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),Then why do we have to think of God? Why do we have to forget about the material world?,Prabhupāda, First of all you have to understand that there is life after death.
Guest (2),"Why, is it a faith or belief?",Prabhupāda," No, it is not faith, belief. It is a fact. Just like, I have already given you the example. You were a child. That body's no longer existing, but you know that you were a child. Therefore the conclusion is that although the body has changed, but you the soul, the knower, is still there. Therefore, when this body will be changed, you'll exist in another body."
Guest (2),In what form?,Prabhupāda," That is another thing. First of all you have to accept this fact, that you have to change this body. As you have already changed so many times.Tathā...Kṛṣṇafirst of all saystathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Antara,another body you have to accept."
Guest (2),Coming back to your own question of the present world and to what we are in...,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest (2),Coming back to your first question when you asked that what do you think about this present world or the present trend of present civilization...?,Prabhupāda," Yes. They do not know. Even big, big professors. I talked with Professor Kotofsky in Moscow. He said, ""Swamiji, after annihilation of this body, there is nothing."""
Guest (2),"Well, that has brought this disaster and is causing more and more trouble, I think. More and more in practice of medicine, if we look into the practice of medicine, I think, we are more pressed with the problem of mental illness. I should say in the region of thirty percent of our time is devoted for people suffering from mental anxiety, which we call ""anxiety state"" and partly depression. I think most of the time, I surmise... Part of the problem is not that they are not well-fed, it is not that they are not well-dressed. Part of the problem is to accept as they are and to think of something which is present, I mean they could believe that there is something beyond this world, and if they can accept that, probably they will be better off and they will accept their present inconveniences more easily and will not be depressed.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),And that is the present problem.,Prabhupāda, That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā:mātrā-sparśāstukaunteyaśītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ.Sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ
Guest (2),"Yes. Can you scientifically prove this, sir? I mean is it purely a matter of belief or...",Prabhupāda," This is science. Our science is perfect science. Because we are receiving knowledge from the perfect,Kṛṣṇa. And the so-called science is imperfect because the knowledge is received from imperfect person. However great scientist you may be, you have to admit that your senses are imperfect."
Guest (3),Yes.,Prabhupāda," So imperfect senses can give imperfect knowledge. That is not scientific knowledge. What you are thinking scientific knowledge, that is bogus. Because the man who has given that knowledge, he's imperfect. How you can expect perfect knowledge from the imperfect person?"
Guest (2),It's a question of degree.,Prabhupāda," Now, degree may be, but ultimately, if you are unable to give perfect knowledge, then what is the use of taking knowledge from you?"
Guest (2),"Yes, I accept that view. But how do you prove that a man...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, therefore you take from the perfect,Kṛṣṇa. We take from Kṛṣṇa's representative. One who speaks as good asKṛṣṇa. That is our process.Evaṁparamparā-prāptamimaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ[Bg.4.2].We don't take, don't accept knowledge from any rascal. We accept knowledge fromKṛṣṇa, the Supreme. I may be rascal, but because I am receiving knowledge from the perfect, whatever we speak, that is perfect. A child may be innocent he does not know. But he has learned that this article is called spectacle. So when he says, the child says, ""Father, this is spectacle."" This is perfect knowledge. Similarly, if you hear from the perfect and act accordingly, then you are perfect. NowKṛṣṇasays,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.After death there is another body. So we accept it. It doesn't require any proof of so-called science who's imperfect."
Guest (2),So the question of belief comes first.,Prabhupāda," It is not belief, it is fact."
Guest (2),"Yes, but if you say fact, how do you prove?",Prabhupāda," This is proof,Kṛṣṇasays."
Guest (2),"It has been said byKṛṣṇa. Yes, but...,",Prabhupāda," That is our Vedic evidence. Whenever we speak something, immediately quote fromVedas.This is our process. If it is accepted by the Vedic process, then it is perfect. Just like in the law court. You are lawyer. You are arguing. When you quote from a judgement, previous judgement, it is accepted. Similarly, when you give authoritative statement support of your talking, then it is perfect. That is the way. Otherwise, what for these books are there? If it is mental speculation what is the use of these books? But as soon as we speak something, we immediately support by quoting from Vedic literature. And that is perfect. And now you have to possess little knowledge. Just likeKṛṣṇasays, howKṛṣṇais perfect.Kṛṣṇais giving example side, by side.Yathā, dehino 'sminyathādehe[Bg.2.13].Asmindehe,as there is the soul, there is the soul,asmindehe,and he's having different types of bodies,kaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarā.He's changing body from childhood, boyhood, boyhood to youth-hood, youth-hood to another state.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.Where is the illogical presentation? This is scientific. For an intelligent man, this is scientific. And if he's still dull-headed, then what can be done?Kṛṣṇagives example.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ.As the soul is changing body, from babyhood to childhood, childhood to boyhood, boyhood to youth-hood, like that. Similarly, after finishing this body, it may be invisible to you, but the subtle body is there. We have got two kinds of bodies.Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhirevaca[Bg.7.4].This material, eight kinds of materials—earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence, ego. So when your body of earth, water, fire, air... Now in the... Now here is a medical man. He knows about this body made of earth, water, fire, air. But he does not know, perhaps, the body made of mind, intelligence and ego. Do you think so? That there is another body made of mind, intelligence and ego?"
Guest (2),"Not, not in that sense.",Prabhupāda," Yes. The mind is there. Everyone knows, you have got mind, I have got mind. But can you see the mind? Can you see the intelligence?"
Guest (1),"These are something abstract, you know.",Prabhupāda," No, not abstract. These are material. You have no eyes to see."
Guest (1),"Well, at present, we can, we have got three different methods of studying intelligence starting from six months onward up to the adult.",Prabhupāda," Anyway, you accept. That is my point. Now you are studying, you accept. That means you accept there is intelligence. So besides this material body, gross material body, there is a subtle body. Subtle body. Just like besides your coat, there is a shirt, or there is aganjee(?). Similarly, the soul is covered by the subtle body and the gross body. What is known as death, that is annihilation of the gross body. The subtle body remains there. And the subtle body carries him as he desires. The subtle body carries him to a place where he can again grow another material body according to the desire of the mind."
Guest (1),"You mean the subtle body or the soul, the same thing?",Prabhupāda," No, soul is different. Soul is different. Soul is finer than intelligence. These things are explained in theBhagavad-gītā."
Guest (4) (English woman); Pradyumna; Guest (4),"Could I ask please, ifprāṇais the life force, isn't it? Is it theprāṇais the life force, isn't it?; Says likeprāṇais the life force.; Is it in different parts of the body?",Prabhupāda," These are air.Prāṇa,in theprāṇa,air, the soul floats. Therefore the controlling the air is calledprāṇāyāma.That is yogic process."
Guest (4),Thank you.,Prabhupāda," Prāṇais a life air which carries the soul. It is very small, atomic. And not our men. Give her. She's answered. (laughs) Give her one."
Guest (4),Thank you.,Prabhupāda," Give her one, that girl. Give all. (Bengali) You are a lawyer. (Bengali) That is not your business. You must know it."
Guest (3),(Bengali),Prabhupāda, That's a good qualification.
Guest (3),No.,Prabhupāda," Why should you be bad qualified? (Bengali) Logic, it is logical.Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Where is the illogic. You have passed your childhood body, you have passed your youth-hood body, you are in a different body. Although you are in a different body, you are existing. What better logic you can discover? You cannot discover any better logic than this. Don't accuse that we are illogical, don't accuse. We are logical, completely logical. But we have got brain to understand. Yes. Logic, you can put forward, but one must have the brain to understand it. If one is dull like stone, how he can understand logic? This is very clear logic.Tathādehāntara-prāptir dhīrastatrana...[Bg.2.13],dhīraḥ,one who is sober, coolheaded, he understands. ""Yes, it is all right."""
Guest (2),"I have taken quite a lot of your time, if you'll excuse me.",Prabhupāda," No, my time is for this purpose, provided you kindly take it. But if you don't take it, then of course, that is a different thing. My time is spent for... I have dedicated my life for this purpose. I am touring all over the world giving this knowledge. It is sound logic. If you don't accept, you must give better logic, what you know. Don't think we are going under sentiment. Don't think like that. We have got sound logic."
Guest (2),"I won't say that, but I'm not mentally prepared to that extent.",Prabhupāda," That's all right, but if you are not prepared, then you learn how to become prepared. Then the same conclusion comes, that logic, you can give to the animals, but he cannot take it."
Guest (2),I don't think that logic can explain anything.,Prabhupāda," No, logic cannot. But still as much logic you require, that logic is there."
Guest (2),"Yes, but I don't know what Mr. Howard wants logic about, I don't know. But logic cannot explain anything and everything. And if mathematics or arithmetic, if we go through them, at one stage we can prove ten is equal to zero or nine is equal to zero. It is also possible by step by step...",Prabhupāda," That may be possible, but it has no practical use. It has no practical use. If the banker gives you zero and you accept nine, then it is practical. But if you theoretically say all these things, that you may keep it in your pocket, but practically it has no use. Nine equal to zero and two equal to zero. That is not practical use."
Guest (2),"As far as logic, I don't think logic can explain anything and everything.",Prabhupāda," No, then it is skepticism. There is no progress of knowledge. There is no progress of knowledge. As far as man can understand, as Mr., you are Mr. Bannerji?"
Guest (1),Mr. Howler. (?),Prabhupāda," Howler? Yes. So, there is little logic there, as a human being can understand. That's all. And if we accept this theory, that logic, our logic is imperfect, we cannot understand, then we have to accept authority. Just like a child. Mother says, ""Here is your father."" There is no logic. There is no logic. He has to accept. Only the mother version is logic, That's all. Authority. Is it not?"
Guest (1),"Yes, that's true.",Prabhupāda," Then where there is no logic, the authority must be accepted. Therefore we accept that authority.Śabda-pramāṇa.The best evidence.Śabda-pramāṇa.There are different evidences. Out of that,veda-pramāṇa,śabda-pramāṇais first class. All right, thank you very much.Jaya."
Mukunda,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, Pearl has been attending our temple and following the regulative principles.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Mukunda,And she wants to become initiated.,Prabhupāda, Oh yes.
Pearl,I would like to have a Sanskrit name too please.,Prabhupāda," Oh yes, you'll have."
Pearl,Thank you.,Prabhupāda, You'll have. You like to be bald-headed?
Pearl,"(laughs) No, I think I'll keep my hair if you don't mind. I can't give up everything.",Prabhupāda, All right.
Pearl,"If my leg could be healed, and I want to advance spiritually.",Prabhupāda," Well, leg, you are different from leg. Yes. Even leg is not healed, you can be healed."
Pearl,You mean healed spiritually.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That is real healing.
Pearl,Because it's keeping me from things I should be doing you see. I can't meet all my responsibilities through it.,Prabhupāda," Give me little water. When they come to logic, when they give logic. (laughter)"
Guest (1),"Prabhupāda, they don't want any.",Prabhupāda, That is the dog's obstinacy. That is the mentality.
Guest (1),"They lost their intelligence, by this civilization or by this culture.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Adānta-gobhir,by losing that intelligence they are going to the hell. They do not know it.Adānta-gobhirviśatāṁtamisram[SB7.5.30].By uncontrolled senses... Because as soon as they come to spiritual life, they have to control senses. So that they do not like. That is very difficult."
Guest (1),"Like he said: ""I'm not prepared for that.""",Prabhupāda, Yes. Actually they are not prepared. Then you suffer.
Guest (1),Then you try to be prepared.,Prabhupāda," They are not prepared because as soon as they understand that they are going to be one these varieties of life, they shudder. Therefore they do not like to understand this. If by logic I prove that you are going to be a dog next life, that is very difficult. Just like one astrologer has said that Jawaharlal Nehru has become a dog in Sweden. You know that?"
Guest (1),"No, I don't.",Prabhupāda," Yes. In Delhi, one astrologer."
Guest (1),"Delhi, some astrologer said?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),"What does the government of India say about that, any comment?",Prabhupāda, That I do not know.
Guest (1),Are they going to worship there? (laughter),Prabhupāda," Well, they do not believe in astrology. Therefore they cannot take any step. They do not believe in next life, so they cannot take any step. And whether it is a fact or not, because they do not believe in next life, so what is the use of taking step? Is it as good as to say that Jawaharlal Nehru has becomeIndra. If somebody says like that, so they'll have to discard this thing also, and they have to discard that thing also. Because they do not believe in the next life. Simply by presentingBhagavad-gītāas it is, we can defy all these rascals. Everything is there.Bhagavad-gītāwas not presented as it is. That is the defect. The first thing is:tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].Nobody understands. And they are students ofBhagavad-gītā.EvenGandhi, he did not understand,dehāntara-prāptiḥ.All these political leaders, they do not understand what isdehāntara-prāptiḥ.What do you think,BhadraKṛṣṇa? Thedehāntara-prāptiḥ,do they understand?"
BhadraKṛṣṇa,It's not something known.,Prabhupāda, Yes. They do not understand.
Guest (1),"(Bengali) Gandhiji, he was politician, he was actually not devotee, and he could not understandBhagavad-gītā.But how the name ofRāmahas come when he died? The name ofRāma,HareRāma, has come from his last word. How it has come. It is, it is...",Prabhupāda," Practice, practice.Raghupatirāghavarājārāma."
Guest (1),So that came at the last word.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),It is due to his pious or practice.,Prabhupāda," Practice. That will act, that will act, that will act."
Guest (1),"So this was my question about how, he was not acting, but...,",Prabhupāda," No. He did not know. But because he was chantingraghupatirāghavarājārāma,that has given him this effect, yes. On account of chanting. But he really did not understand. Just like the same example, the Mohammedan. He said""hārāma."" He wanted to speak""hārāma,"" but it become""hārāma."" That is the... He did not know anything aboutRāma, but the nameRāmais so powerful that although he said,""hārāma,"" it effected. Yes. ButGandhimay not know the purpose ofBhagavad-gītā,but as he chanted""hārāma,"" that has been effective."
Pearl,"I wondered what ""Rāma"" meant when we say themantra,HareRāma, you see.",Prabhupāda, Rāmameans...
Guest (3),"So it was not due to his pious activities, but only he was practicing.",Prabhupāda," No, that is pious activity, that is pious activity."
Guest (1),"That is why at the time of death he spokeRāma,raghupatirāghavarājārāma.",Prabhupāda, He was a pious man.
Guest (1),He was pious man.,Prabhupāda, Undoubtedly.
Guest (1),"So he chanted ""Rāma"" in practice.",Prabhupāda," Daily he was chantingraghupatirāghavarājārāma.So...,"
Guest (3),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Yes. Where this chanting effect will go? Yes. The chanting...HareKṛṣṇa. But I mean to say that he could not teach whatRāma.
Guest (1),(laughs) No.,Prabhupāda," That is his misfortune. But in spite of his misfortune, because he was practiced to chant the name ofRāma, he was pious. Although he was ignorant. He was absorbed in thought of politics. He should have, if he would have understood thatRāmais a fact,Kṛṣṇais a fact... That he did not understand. Then he would have preached the glories ofRāma, glories ofKṛṣṇa. He took the chanting ofRāmafor his political purposes. He utilized for political purpose. Just like... That isnāma-aparādha.Samaḥśubha-kriyāmatipramāṇaḥ(?). He was trying to get some material profit by chanting the holy name ofRāma. That he got, material profit. He was the most famous politician, all over the world."
Guest (1),"But he did not accept any post, you know that? At the same time...,",Prabhupāda," But he also accepted ""Mahatma"" although what..."
Guest (1),But not political post.,Prabhupāda," That is another trick, it may be. Or he did not like. It may be. Because he was so great, what is the presidency? Presidency elected post for five years. But he was recognized all over the world as a great leader. That is greater than any president's post or prime minister's post. So that is not much. But the thing is that if he was actually aware of the importance ofRāma, that he did not. He took it, ""Rāma"" as some means for his political purpose. But still it effected. At the time of death he said, ""Rāma."" So..."
Guest (1),"So you think he has gone to heaven or some, what is his position?",Prabhupāda," No... But because he did not understandRāma, therefore he cannot go to the kingdom of God. But he'll get very high position."
Guest (1),High position.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. He may go to the heavenly planet"
Guest (1); Śrutakīrti,Still in the material world.; He said he's still in the material world. Heavenly planets is still the material world.,Prabhupāda," Heaven is in the material world. Heaven is in the material world. You can get greater standard of life, greater duration of life, that's all. Higher standard of life. Just likeBrahmā. Brahmā's one day you cannot calculate. He's so powerful, how he's created this universe. But he is in the material world. He's also a living entity like us, but very exalted. So he cannot get the post ofBrahmā. But he can get life in higher planetary system. That is certain. That is explained in the, find out that verse. That is explained in the...um. That verse,yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyateśucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgehe[Bg.6.41].But he did not understandBhagavad-gītā,that's a fact."
Guest (1),But what about this position of Vālmīki orRāmāyaṇa?,Prabhupāda, They went to the kingdom of God. They knew what isRāma.
Guest (1),They knew.,Prabhupāda, Yes. They are not in vague understanding.
Guest (1),They wouldn't be able to writeRāmāyaṇaif he didn't understand LordRāmacandra?,Prabhupāda, Yes. He had meditated for sixty thousands of years.
Guest (1),"But I think it wasGandhiwho said thatKurukṣetrais this body, five Pāṇḍavas is the five senses and this is all interpretation concoction.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) He did not understand, that's a fact. But even this child, he does not understand, but if he chantsHareKṛṣṇa, that will be effective. If he understands or not understand. It doesn't matter."
Guest (1),The name is so powerful.,Prabhupāda, Yes. What is that?
Pradyumna,Prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.,Prabhupāda," Ah,prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.This is the... Sopuṇya-kṛtāṁlokānmeans heavenly planet.Prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān.You cannot go to the heavenly planet unless you are very pious. So he's promoted in heavenly planet where the duration of life is very long, standard of living is very nice. But there is noKṛṣṇaconsciousness. What is that,prāpyapuṇya-kṛtāṁlokān?"
Pradyumna,Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ[Bg.6.41].,Prabhupāda, Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ.For a very long time. Because to get life in the heavenly planets means at least ten thousands of years. In their calculation. Their one day is equal to six months. In that way ten thousand years.Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ.What is it?Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ?
Pradyumna,"Uṣitvāśāśvatīḥsamāḥ,śucīnāṁśrīmatāṁgeheyoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate[Bg.6.41].",Prabhupāda," Then, again they come down to this material world and he takes birth either in a very exaltedbrāhmaṇafamily,śucīnām,or very rich,vaiśyafamily. After enjoying there, again he's given chance to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. And if he misses, then again he goes down. Therefore NarottamadāsaṬhākura says these are all false elevation. If I have to come again back, again I have to accept another lower grade life, then what is the profit?Kṛṣṇagives His straight understanding,tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmeti: [Bg.4.9] You becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. After the giving up this body, no more material body either in the heavenly planet or in the lower hellish planet. ""You come direct to Me."" That is perfection. You should not be attracted by somebody has gone to heavenly planet for ten thousands of years living. We should not be attracted by these things. Therefore PrabodhānandaSarasvatīsays,kaivalyaṁnarakāyatetridaśa-purākāśa-puṣpāyate.Tridaśa-purmeans the heavenly planets.Ākāśa,it is just like will of the wisp. Something, just like, what do you say Hindi? There are many proverbs, which has no existence. Just like in Bengali we sayghoḍā-ḍima.Ghoḍa-ḍima. Ḍimameans egg. The horse never lays down egg. But the word is running on: ""the egg of horse."" So it has no existence but the word is there. Similarly, what do you say in Hindi? Something which has no existence but it is current. I think there is."
Guest (1),Hawaikila(?).,Prabhupāda," Hawaikila,yes.Hawaikilameans in the air there is a fort. It is something like, theVaiṣṇavaconsiders the heavenly planets, thathawaikila.That's all."
Guest (1),This rich birth is important for self-realization?,Prabhupāda, Next birth?
Devotees,"Rich birth, to be born in a rich family.",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. But there is facility. Because people are harassed for getting food and shelter. Everyone is working so hard where to get nice food, where to get nice shelter. Rich man means he has already got. So if he's sane, if he's good, has got good association, direction, then he can think, that ""I have no anxiety for my food, shelter and other necessities of life. So how I shall utilize my time?"" And if he gets goodguru, then he can utilize very nicely, chantingHareKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. That is a chance. He hasn't got to work. Because people are very much perplexed how to get shelter, how to get food. But he has got the chance. He hasn't got to endeavor for food and shelter and other necessities of the body. Ample he has got. He can save time for spiritual advancement. That is an advantage. It is not necessary. It is almost disadvantage. But actually it is advantage. Unfortunately, those who are born in rich family, they take advantage of it that ""I have got so much money, let me enjoy sense gratification.""Māyādictates, ""Oh, you have got so much money. Utilize for wine-woman."" That's all."
Guest (1),People say about UrayaKaranSingh...,Prabhupāda, KaranSingh?
Guest (1),"...of Kashmir, he's a very pious man, and because rich birth and he is a pious as well, is it?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),Very religious and...,Prabhupāda," No, I have seen him. He's religious temperament. Not very. He lovesKṛṣṇa. No, he's a good man."
Guest (1); Guest (1),"That's a good example, example like that.; Likes theBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda," Yes, he's a good man. He's good scholar also, educated."
Guest (1),He was coming but I don't know why he has not come due to this...? This last year hearingBhāgavatamdiscourses he accepted he would come come. We got his letter also.,Prabhupāda, This is due to government post.
Guest (1),"And he also accepted an invitation, we invited him, He said he'd also come, but this Pakistan war started.",Prabhupāda," Still there are so many respectable person came. The governor came, the high-court justices and that, the Canadian ambassador came. Many men came. And he was very humble. Hesatdown below."
Guest (1),You didn't see the high commissioner there. Hesatdown.,Prabhupāda, He's also a very nice man.
Guest (1),Maybe some pious activities that they have.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (1),But this is their duty to respect.,Prabhupāda," [break] ...in this planet. In order to be elevated to the kingdom of God, they cannot go directly from the heavenly planet. They'll have to come here."
Guest (1),"There are many stories inMahābhārata.Many, many kings, they went to heavenly planets and from there. Many stories.",Prabhupāda, Kṣīṇepuṇyemartya-lokaṁviśanti[Bg.9.21].You have gotprasāda?Not yet. Come on. Any more? Any more? Another? Come on. (end)

Professor,It's a question of...,Prabhupāda, ...about way.
Professor,"Yes, of course, it's difficult to practice, of course, for people in general also. But, of course, he has also written hymns.",Prabhupāda, Yes. AboutKṛṣṇa.
Professor,"And they are... Yes. And they are, of course, a bit different. So he, Śaṅkara himself, seemed to...",Prabhupāda," That is explained in thisCaitanya-caritāmṛta,why Śaṅkara prepared, presented hisMāyāvādaphilosophy. It is explained there."
Śrutakīrti,I remember where it was.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Śrutakīrti,I remember where it was...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes. [break]"
Professor,Do you have classes onCaitanya-caritāmṛta?,Prabhupāda, Oh yes. Read it.
Pradyumna,,Prabhupāda, ...hayasarva-nāśa.Read the English translation.
Pradyumna,"""Śaṅkarācārya, who is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless because he is servant carrying out the orders of the Lord, but those who follow hisMāyāvādīphilosophy are doomed. They will lose all their advancement in spiritual knowledge.""",Prabhupāda," This is the opinion ofCaitanyaMahāprabhu. Anyone who hears Śaṅkara's comment onVedāntaphilosophy, he is doomed."
Professor,That's about it.,Prabhupāda, What is the purport?
Pradyumna,"""Māyāvādī philosophers are very proud of exhibiting theirVedāntaknowledge through grammatical jugglery, but Lord ŚrīKṛṣṇainBhagavad-gītācertifies that they aremāyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ[Bg.7.15],bereft of real knowledge due tomāyā.Māyāhas two potencies with which to execute her two functions:prakṣepātmikā...""",Prabhupāda, Prakṣepātmikā.
Pradyumna,"""...śakti,the power to throw the living entity in the ocean of material existence, andāvaraṇātmikā-śakti,the power to cover the knowledge of the living entity. The function of theāvaraṇātmikā-śaktiis explained theBhagavad-gītāby the word:māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.Why thedaivī-māyā,or illusory energy ofKṛṣṇatakes away the knowledge of theMāyāvādīphilosophers is also explained inBhagavad-gītāby the use of the wordsāsuraṁbhāvamāśritāḥ,which refer to a person who does not agree to the existence of the Lord. The Māyāvādīs, who are not in agreement with the existence of the Lord, can be classed in two groups, exemplified by the impersonalists Śaṅkarites ofVārāṇasīand the Buddhists of Saranātha. Both of them are Māyāvādīs, andKṛṣṇatakes away their knowledge due to their atheistic philosophies. Neither of them agree to accept the existence of a personal God. The Buddhist philosophers clearly deny, clearly deny both the soul and God, and although the Śaṅkarites do not openly deny God, they say that the Absolute isnirākāra,or formless. Thus both of them areaviśuddha-buddhayaḥ[SB10.2.32],or imperfect and unclean in their knowledge and intelligence.""",Prabhupāda, What do you think?
Professor,"That's... Of course, in the introduction to Śaṅkara's commentary toBhagavad-gītā,he does, it seems, if it is for him, which is that...",Prabhupāda, He acceptsKṛṣṇaas the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Professor,"Yes,Kṛṣṇa, yes.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Professor,"So Śaṅkara is a bit difficult because his followers, even he'sMāyāvādī, the followers, even the followers, they clearly believe in it. But whether, what Śaṅkara himself meant by it...",Prabhupāda," No, that is explained. Śaṅkara is the incarnation of Lord Śiva. He has no fault. He has simply executed the order of the Supreme Lord. But the way in which he has presented the commentary, one should not hear it. That is his warning. Here is the Tenth Canto ofBhāgavatam,two volumes."
Professor,"That's also ""Not forsalein India"". Why?",Prabhupāda, Because...
Professor,"Well, I'm not in India.",Prabhupāda," India, we make members. We get more price. Because we are, our scheme, life member, they pay eleven hundred rupees, and whatever books we can supply, we supply. That's all. That is not even to the amount they pay. So we give our presentation and they contribute. This is the program."
Professor,"Do you use any grammar, Sanskrit grammar, when you study Sanskrit?",Prabhupāda, Sanskrit grammar?
Professor; Paramahaṁsa,"Yes, how do they learn when they learn Sanskrit?; Yes.",Prabhupāda, We have given some hints.
Professor,Or do they learn from a text or...?,Prabhupāda," We have given some hints. In the last... You can show him, in theBhagavad-gītā.OrĪśopaniṣad.The mode, how to read."
Professor,"No, Sanskrit is quite difficult...",Prabhupāda," Yes, there..."
Professor,Many forms and so forth.,Prabhupāda," Now, these boys, they did not know Sanskrit. By, by following the direction, they read very nicely these diacritic marks."
Professor; Pradyumna; Professor,"Yes. Oh, this is good.; (indistinct); But they don't learn how to inflect forms and so on...",Prabhupāda, Simply they have to learn the alphabet.
Professor,"Alphabet, but not, I mean...",Prabhupāda, They they write the mark...
Professor,"Devaḥ,devam,devena,devāya,and so on.",Prabhupāda," He has given the direction. This is made by him, how to pronounce. And then, by practice, it comes."
Professor,Are you going to have anykīrtanaalso tonight?,Prabhupāda," Oh yes, why not? You want to hear?"
Professor,"Yes, very much.",Prabhupāda," Well, all right. Begin."
Pradyumna,With themṛdaṅga?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,Karatālas.,Prabhupāda, So you are abhakta?You are a devotee.
Professor,Well... I'm sorry.,Prabhupāda, Now you have appeared. Very good.
Professor,Well... But...,Prabhupāda, So we have got a...
Professor,...well I'm studying it and I'm attracted by many things.,Prabhupāda," No, studying, there are many scholars, they are studying, but you are factuallybhakta.How you wanted to hearkīrtana?That is the sign ofbhakta.Yes.Śravaṇaṁkīrtanaṁviṣṇoḥsmaraṇaṁpāda-sevanam[SB7.5.23].Tanmanye'dhītamuttamam.Uttamam.He has, he has studied really."
Professor,"In India, where is your center? Do you have any headquarters or something like that...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, I have got center inVṛndāvana."
Professor,Oh?,Prabhupāda," Yes, inNavadvīpa. I was, after my retirement from family, I was staying atVṛndāvana. From 1956. Then in 1965 I came to America. So... Where is Haṁsadūta?"
Paramahaṁsa,"He's leadingkīrtanadownstairs, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Ācchā.Then...? You can, you can lead. Or anyone can lead. [break] So you like thiskīrtana?"
Professor,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Professor,It's very unusual in Sweden.,Prabhupāda," So you are, you are a devotee. Kindly cooperate with us, and overfloodKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You are educated. Your word will be accepted more than ours."
Professor; Haṁsadūta,Yeah. How does one order these books?; We have them here or...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa; Professor,We just received shipment from Germany.; You stock them here?,Prabhupāda," Yes, all the books are there."
Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor,"(indistinct) You have spoken to him.; I have spoken to him on the phone. He's on a trip, I think.; Yes, to New York, I think.",Prabhupāda, So what is your full name?
Professor,Carl Suneson. It's quite difficult.,Prabhupāda, Carl Simhasan.
Professor,"S, U, N, E, S, O, N.",Prabhupāda, You are this...?
Paramahaṁsa; Professor,"Swedish.; Swedish, yes.",Prabhupāda, So he can attend our meeting. He can introduce. That will be nice.
Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor,"Yes.; Yes. We're having a meeting, as you know, tomorrow night, at the Stockholm University.; Yes, I'll probably be coming, yes.; If you would, would you be kind enough, perhaps, to give an introductory lecture or, you know, to...; Well...; ...say, praise, or your appreciation of our movement or Śrīla Prabhupāda's teachings in front of the audience.; I, I, I don't know exactly... I hope I can come, but I can't say for sure.; I understand. I understand. Well, you're kindly invited. That goes without saying.; Yes, yes, I'll try to come. That will be at the University.; Yes, tomorrow evening at seven-thirty.; No, I'll try to come. Do you think, this one, do you think I could...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, this is also available."
Professor; Paramahaṁsa,"...for myself, or...?; Unfortunately, I think we have to order these.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Śrutakīrti,I don't think they have it here yet in your...,Prabhupāda, We are getting the consignment. Now we have only one copy.
Professor,This is the only copy you have?,Prabhupāda," Yes. But if you want to read overnight, then you can take. You can return tomorrow."
Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor,"Of course, if I don't take...; Hm? No, I can return. I can.; That's all right. I can wait. But then I get a copy of... That will be all right.",Prabhupāda, So give him someprasādam.
Śrutakīrti; Professor,Someone went out to get it. [break]; ...kīrtanas?,Prabhupāda, Eh? Bengali?
Professor; Haṁsadūta,"Yes. Yes. Do you sing any hymns,kīrtanasin Bengali also?; Do we sing in Bengali?",Prabhupāda, Oh yes.

Professor,Who has written this?,Prabhupāda, NarottamadāsaṬhākura.
Professor,How old is this one?,Prabhupāda, Eh? It is about two hundred fifty years ago it was written. There are many songs of Narottama Ṭhākura.
Pradyumna,All. theMahājana-gītiby Narottamadāsa.,Prabhupāda," Oh. There are so many songs. So you have devotional tendency. Develop it. Make your life successful. That is my humble suggestion.Manuṣya-janamapāiyā,rādhā-kṛṣṇanābhajiyā,jāniyāśuniyābi...Anyone who has got this human form of life, he does not engage himself in developingKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then he's drinking poison knowingly.Jāniyāśuniyābiṣakhāinu.Biṣameans poison. A great opportunity, this human life. That is our mission, that this modern civilization, they have created such entanglement that people are rotting and they are losing the opportunity of this human form of life. Only on the basis of this bodily concept of life."
Professor,Are you working all...? In what countries in Europe?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Professor; Haṁsadūta,"In what countries in Europe are you working in? Besides Scandinavia?; In Germany, France and England, Holland, everywhere, in all countries.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Of course, this..."
Professor; Haṁsadūta; Professor; Haṁsadūta,"But East, Eastern Europe's impossible, eh?; Yes, as a matter of fact, we, we have a devotee in East Berlin. But, of course, it's very difficult because the government doesn't allow it. But we just... He keeps a shaved head, and he's chanting. He's reading our books.; But nobody has interfered with him?; Well, nobody knows.",Prabhupāda, Hm?
Haṁsadūta,"I was just telling him about this devotee we have in East Berlin. We have a devotee in East Berlin who's chanting, and keeps a shaven head.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Professor; Paramahaṁsa; Haṁsadūta; Paramahaṁsa; Professor,"Do you know Professor Kotofsky?; Kotofsky? No.; In Moscow. He's a Sanskrit... Head of the oriental studies.; Kotofsky?; Yes. He's uh... Śrīla Prabhupāda, also met him one time in Moscow.; But he's not a devotee.; No.; No, but that's...",Prabhupāda," Now, I, when we were talking, I asked him one question, that ""Professor Kotofsky, you are communist, I am Kṛṣṇite. So where is the difference of philosophy? Because you have to accept one authority, leader. So you have accepted Lenin as leader; we have acceptedKṛṣṇaas leader. So where is the difference on the principle?"" So he could not answer. But he very much appreciated this, that ""Where is the difference between these two principles."" But now we have to consider whether the leadership of Lenin is good, or the leadership ofKṛṣṇais good. That is another thing. But you have to accept one leader. You cannot do without leader. That is not possible."
Professor,"Well, well, to some extent it's possible.",Prabhupāda," No, every extent. Anyone, anyone calling... So many philosophy or ism, he has got leader. That you cannot avoid. The Buddhists, they are following LordBuddha. Christians, they are following Lord Jesus Christ. Mohammedans, they are following Mohammed. Similarly the communists, they are following Lenin, or Max. What is?"
Devotees; Paramahaṁsa,Marx.; Karl Marx.,Prabhupāda, Karl Marx.
Professor,"But, of course, in Sweden, most people, they don't, they don't follow anybody. So it's... I mean...",Prabhupāda," No, they follow. At least, one follows himself. Is it not? ""Don't follow anyone"" means he follows himself. He has got a particular philosophy, and he's the leader."
Professor,"Well, naturally, everybody has some kind of ideas, I mean, how to lead his life.",Prabhupāda, But that will not help us.
Professor,"But, uh...",Prabhupāda," Unless we accept the real leader, a perfect personality who can give us perfect knowledge, there is no success. That is our philosophy."
Professor,"Well, one has to acquire knowledge.",Prabhupāda," Eh. Yeah. Therefore, if we have to acquire knowledge, we must go to a person who does not commit mistake, who is not illusioned. There are four defects in the conditioned soul: to commit mistake, to become illusioned, to cheat others, and imperfectness of senses. One may declare himself that he's perfect in knowledge, but his senses are imperfect. So how he can call himself that he has got the perfect knowledge by speculative method?"
Professor,Hm.,Prabhupāda," The instrument which he is using for speculation, that instrument itself is imperfect."
Professor,"Well, normally our knowledge will be imperfect in some way or...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Professor,Normally our knowledge is imperfect in one way or another.,Prabhupāda, How it is perfect?
Professor; Haṁsadūta,Im...; Imperfect.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Haṁsadūta; Professor,Imperfect.; That is...,Prabhupāda," So imperfect knowledge, one who has got imperfect knowledge, how he can give lesson perfect?"
Professor,"No, but you can still give something, even if you...",Prabhupāda," Oh, that's all right, you get something, but that is not perfect."
Professor,"No, but of course, there are different kinds of knowledge and...",Prabhupāda," No, our principle is to get perfect knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He's above these defects.Vedāhaṁ samatītānivartamānānica...[Bg.7.26]. Find out this verse."
Pradyumna,Bhagavad-gītā.,Prabhupāda," First of all, you find out that verse:bahūnimejanmānivyatītānitavacārjuna."
Pradyumna,,Prabhupāda, Purport.
Pradyumna,"""In theBrahma-saṁhitāwe have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:",Prabhupāda, Infallible. Infallible. This word is used.Acyuta.Hm.
Pradyumna,"""...without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still, the same original, the oldest and the person always appearing as a fresh youth... (Pradyumnagoes on reading the purport until:) ...in the following verse."" Then the next verse.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Pradyumna,Then the next verse.,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Pradyumna; Professor,"; Well, it is quite widely read, theBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Professor; Pradyumna; Professor,"TheBhagavad-gītāis quite widely read.; This is an introduction by Professor Dimock.; Yes, I've seen it. I read it. But it is quite widely read, you know. I mean the translations...",Prabhupāda," But one thing is that otherBhagavad-gītās,they have interpreted in their own (indistinct) not as it is. That is the difference. Just like you, you must have readBhagavad-gītāby Radhakrishnan."
Professor; Professor,"Yaḥ.; Yes, sir. Radhakrishnan's, yes.",Prabhupāda," Now he says, he misinterprets that ""This is not to the personKṛṣṇa."" Just see."
Professor,"No, but Radhakrishnan, his... He has wide knowledge also, but his interpretations...",Prabhupāda, This is his knowledge.
Professor,But his interpretations are...,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇasays. Why he should interpret in that way?Kṛṣṇapersonally says that ""You become My devotee."" And he says ""It is not toKṛṣṇa, the person."" Why? He has no right to say like that. This way, these people mislead. If he is commenting onBhagavad-gītā,he must presentBhagavad-gītāas it is. Why he gives his own opinion? If I say, ""Give me a glass of water,"" how you cay say, ""No, it is not to him?"" How you can say? Is that very good thing? That Radhakrishnan has done.Kṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ.He says, ""It is not toKṛṣṇa, person."" Just see. Do you think he has got the right to do so?"
Professor,"No, but I don't think Radhakrishnan's commentaries are...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes. Just see. It is there."
Professor,"They are very incorrect often, and uh...",Prabhupāda, He has done this. You can see from...
Professor,"Yes, but there's a translation by Franklin Edgarton (?) of theBhagavad-gītā.",Prabhupāda," Translation is all right, but his commentation is wrong. Translation is all right. I know. That's very nice. It is done by some Englishman. Eh?"
Professor,"Well, that's one. Yes. And also there is Edgarton (?). He was an American Sanskrit scholar.",Prabhupāda," No, translation, there is, there is good translation. But he comments like that. Just likeSarvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya. WhenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwas asked that ""You are hearing; You do not speak anything,"" He said, ""Yes, I am understanding the original verse of theVedāntavery clearly, but you are trying to cover the meaning. Therefore I am puzzled."" This is the business of the Māyāvādīs. They'll simply puzzle. That's all."
Professor,Who? TheMāyā...?,Prabhupāda, Māyāvādī.
Professor,"Māyāvādī, hm.",Prabhupāda, Yes. You also told me that it is very difficult to understand the jugglery way of presentation.
Professor,"Well, I think it's time for me to leave.",Prabhupāda," All right, thank you."
Professor,I have a long way home.,Prabhupāda, Give him this garland. Hm.Jaya.(end)
Ambassador,"February, six months ago.",Prabhupāda, Oh. I went Moscow in...?
Paramahaṁsa,1970.,Prabhupāda, Nineteen...?
Paramahaṁsa,Seventy.,Prabhupāda," No, no. I think nineteen..."
Haṁsadūta,Seventy-one.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Haṁsadūta,Seventy...,Prabhupāda, Two.
Haṁsadūta,"Seventy-two, that's right.",Prabhupāda, June.
Haṁsadūta; Paramahaṁsa; Haṁsadūta,June.; That was last year?; Seventy-one.,Prabhupāda, Eh? Seventy-one.
Paramahaṁsa,"In April, I think, or March.",Prabhupāda, You were there at seventy-one?
Ambassador,"Seventy-one, I was, I think, there. I might have gone to India on leave. I returned in March, the end of March. Because I don't remember the...",Prabhupāda," Yes. I went there in June, 1971."
Ambassador,"And did you stay in the city, or did...?",Prabhupāda," Yes, in National Hotel. One Madrasi gentleman..."
Ambassador,"I remember now, sir. Abhiyarthe(?) Natarajan.",Prabhupāda," Nataraja, yes."
Ambassador,Mr. Natarajan Rao told me because I was away. I was away in Central Asia. I remember his telling me. And Natarajan looked after.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambassador,I see.,Prabhupāda, So you have heard something about our movement?
Ambassador,"General, generally, in general.",Prabhupāda," All over the world, they are expecting something spiritual enlightenment from India. That is a fact. But our government is callous in that respect. Therefore any so-called swami, yogis, come from India, they gather to receive him, to hear something from him. Yes. This is the tendency, that... The real thing is that people expected something... Still they are respectful to India on account of the spiritual enlightenment. That I have studied. Still they go to India to have some spiritual enlightenment. And actually we have got this in India. If anything has to be learned about spiritual, then it is only India. That has been admitted by one Chinese gentleman. He's a learned scholar. His book is recommended in New York University. I forget his name. He has written in his book that ""If you want to learn something religion and spiritual, then you must go to India."""
Ambassador,"It must beLin-yu-tang, no.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Ambassador,Was itLin-yu-tang?,Prabhupāda, I don't know.
Ambassador,Yu-tang. You see he's a very great admirer of (indistinct),Prabhupāda, And that's a fact. But our Indian government is not very serious about it.
Ambassador,"No, we have a difficulty, Your Eminence. We have got a problem in India because we have got this multi-religious society. So we have to be careful. But individuals can...",Prabhupāda, No...
Ambassador,"Because we have got to be... We should not be misunderstood. As a government, we should not take too strong a policy about any particular religion, even though it is the religion of the majority of the people.",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. It is the duty of the government... Secular state means neutral to any kind of religion. But it is the duty of government to see that people are religious. Not that ""Because government is secular, let the people go to hell."""
Ambassador,"No, that's true.",Prabhupāda," Yes. If you are Muslim, and, it is my duty as government to see that you are actually acting as a Muslim. If you are aHindu, it is the government's duty to see that you are acting as aHindu. If you are a Christian, it is the government's duty. You cannot give up religion.Dharmenahīnāḥpaśubhiḥsamānāḥ.If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, then they are simply animals. So it is the government's duty to see that the citizens are not becoming animals. He may profess a type of religion. That doesn't matter. But he must be religious. That is secular state. Not that secular state means government is callous, ""Let the people become cats and dogs, without religion. Government doesn't care."" That is not good government. What do you think?"
Ambassador,"I think, Your Eminence, there's a lot in what you say, but, you know, politics is the art of the possible.",Prabhupāda," No. No, politics means to see that people are advanced, citizens are advanced, not that they are degraded."
Ambassador,"Your Eminence, I agree, but I think the duty of the government primarily is to provide conditions in which gifted people, spiritual people like you, leaders like you, can function. More than that, if the government does, it might probably even corrupt the religious... I don't know. Like an umpire in agame, you know, or something... Provide the conditions, provide the conditions for free speech. Not like Moscow, you know, where it is...",Prabhupāda," No. That is... Just like you have got the Commerce Department. Government has got. What is the duty of the Commerce Department? The government must see that the trade enterprise, common share, or industrial enterprise, they are doing nicely, properly. The government issuing license. They have got supervision. They send sometimes, what is called, inspectors? Education. Say, for education. There is educational inspector, school inspector. They go see that the students are properly being educated in that school. Similarly, government should have expert men in the government to see that the Hindus are acting likeHindu, Muslims are acting like Muslim, and Christians are acting like Christian. The government should not be callous about religion. They may be neutral that whatever religion you profess, government has nothing to do. You do nicely. But it is the government's duty to see that you are doing nicely, you are not bluffing. That is government's duty."
Ambassador,"Probably, as far as moral conduct is concerned, but more than that, how is it possible, you know? For the inner man in the spiritual mind, each individual can conceive his own philosophy, but the external conduct, the, the, what is called...?",Prabhupāda," No, no. External conduct means on religious principle."
Ambassador,This is what I was...,Prabhupāda," Yes.Harāvabhaktasyakuto...I... You can, you can..."
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda, ...understand Sanskrit.
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Harāvabhaktasyakuto mahad-guṇāḥ. Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyakiñcanāsarvair guṇaistatrasamāsatesurāḥ[SB5.18.12].If one has got faith and devotion to God, God is one... God is neither Christian norHindunor Muslim. God is one. So religion means according to... Not according to... This is the Vedic conclusion."
Ambassador,I heard about it.,Prabhupāda," I was invited there to speak: ""East and West."" So I explained that so far we are concerned, we have no such thing as east and west. But still, there is difference between east and west that in the Eastern countries, especially in India, even in the remotest part of the village, a cultivator, poor cultivator, he'll understand God consciousness very easily. And so far in the West, I talked with Professor Kotofsky... Perhaps you know."
Ambassador,Yes. In Oriental Institute.,Prabhupāda," Yes. He said, ""Swamiji, after this body's finished, everything is finished."" You see? Such a big professor. He..."
Ambassador,That is Marxist materialism.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Ambassador,It is Marxist materialism.,Prabhupāda," But Marxist materialism, does it mean a congregation of some fools and rascals?"
Ambassador,"I think so, true.",Prabhupāda," Does it mean they like that some congregation of fools and rascals? Such a big professor, he does not know, he cannot understand even that there is life after death. He has to accept another body. As we are accepting different bodies. I was a child. You were a child. Then I became a boy. That is different body. Different consciousness also. A child, three-four years, he talks in a different way. A boy, ten-twelve years, he talks in a different way, and a young man, educated young man, he talks in a different way. So with the change of the body, the consciousness is changing. Is it not?"
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Children, small children, they're just like animals. The cats and dogs, just they are playing, they're also playing like that. But he, he does not belong to that category because when he'll get..., he'll get another body in which he'll be intelligent. Another body, he'll be highly educated. Another body, he'll be doctorate. The cats and dogs, they'll have to wait to get that body. So with the body, we are changing our consciousness. So different body, different consciousness. Similarly, why not after death a different body, different consciousness? If you make progress. Yes. This is progressive. So that is confirmed inBhagavad-gītā:tathādehāntara-prāptir dhīrastatranamuhyati[Bg.2.13]."
Ambassador,"But in the countries like Moscow, Soviet Union, they are hostile, against it, but in most countries of the world, they're indifferent. It's...",Prabhupāda," No, no. Why Moscow? Everywhere. Moscow, they are, rather, good that they say, ""We don't believe in God."""
Ambassador,"That's true, that's true.",Prabhupāda," But others, they say that ""I amHindu,"" ""I am Muslim,"" ""I am Christian,"" ""I believe in God,"" but he does not know anything."
Ambassador,"I'm afraid most of us are like that, to be honest. That's true.",Prabhupāda," (laughs) I should say that Moscow are gentlemen. Because they cannot understand, they say, ""Don't believe."""
Ambassador,It'smūḍha-dhī.,Prabhupāda," Yes. But these rascals, they say, ""Yes, I'm religious,"" but he's doing most irreligious activities. You see? I asked the Christian so many times that ""Your Bible says, 'Thou shalt not kill.' Why you are killing?"" They cannot give any satisfactory answer. This is my experience. It is clearly said, ""Thou shalt not kill."" And they are maintaining slaughterhouses. What is this? The other day in London, one lady, she was showing me... She... You were present? Broke some grass blade?"
Haṁsadūta,"Oh yes, I was present.",Prabhupāda," Just see. Breaking a grass blade is equal to keeping a big, organized slaughterhouse. Just see."
Ambassador,I see.,Prabhupāda," This is their intelligence. She has complained, ""It is also killing."" Supposing it is killing. Actually it is not killing. Supposing it is killing. This killing and keeping organized slaughterhouse killing is the same thing. Just see. People have become so degraded."
Ambassador,This is sophistry.,Prabhupāda," They give this example that: ""You also kill vegetables, just this grass blade is broken. It is killed. So it is equal to maintaining a big slaughterhouse."" You see? This is going on, under the name ofre... They, they were Christian nuns. In London they come to me, talk some time. So... And in India also, we see now cow killing is going on, regular slaughterhouse and... What can I say? You are government man. (laughs) You may take some wrong views about me. What is your opinion, personal?"
Ambassador,"I'm afraid I'm a very democratic person. If people, if they sincerely believe that they cannot exist without meat, they should be permitted, and once that is granted...",Prabhupāda," No, no, no."
Ambassador,...you have to organize slaughterhouses.,Prabhupāda," Then, then that is the, our misfortune that we have lost our Indian culture."
Ambassador,Because...,Prabhupāda, Indian culture.
Ambassador,"Your Grace, what you want is really a sort of complete...",Prabhupāda," No, I don't want."
Ambassador,"...a strong, obedient, disciplined society. But the moment the disciplinarian becomes a dictator, it is...",Prabhupāda," It is, it is the duty of the government to see. That is the government. Strong government means..."
Ambassador,It's theRāma-rājyaideal.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Strong government means that, that government should be very, very vigilant that citizens are doing their duty properly. That is the first duty. They should be given all protection. At the same time... Just like the father gives protection to the children, at the same time, very strict that they are morally and disciplinary, they are going, coming out nice. That is father's duty. It is government's duty. If the father thinks, ""Let my son go to hell. I don't care. I give them some food. That's all."" Is that father's duty? No. Father's duty, to arrange for their food, for their dress, for their shelter, at the same time, to see that they are growing nice, not rascals. That is father's duty. Similarly, government's duty is that. We see from Vedicśāstragovernment duty is that. Otherwise why there is need of government? Government... Now it is government. But formerly it was the king. The king must be representative of God. Because... Who is God? God meansnityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām,ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13). Kaṭhopaniṣad.So God, what is God? God means He's also person.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.He is also eternal, He's also cognizant. We are also eternal, we are also cognizant. But what is the difference between God and we? The difference is He maintains us.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.Bahu-vacanam, nityānām, cetanānām,this isbahu-vacanam.Andnityaḥ,cetanaḥ,eka-vacanam.So what is the difference between this singular number and plural number? The singular number is maintaining the plural number.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.So God is maintaining everyone. So difference is that He is so powerful, He can maintain every living entity. He's maintaining the elephants in Africa, who eat, at a time, forty kilos. He's supplying food. There's no scarcity of food in the jungle for the elephants. Neither there is scarcity... In the hole of your room, you'll find hundreds and thousands ofui.Who is feeding them, within the hole? Unless they're eating, sleeping, the same thing are there. How they are living very nicely? But who is giving them food within the hole? A small hole. You did not provide that hole. You did not provide their food. But there are hundreds and millions of ants. They're living there within the hole very happily. Sometimes they come out. We see: ""Oh, wherefrom so many hundreds coming?"" Soekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.That is God. He's supplying food. So there are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. Out of that, 400,000 are human beings. Out of that, many are uncivilized. The uncivilized aborigines live in the jungle. They have no economic problem. They're also human being. They never come to city for food. They are maintaining themselves. The elephants are maintaining. The ants are maintaining. Why the civilized, a few men, they have got so problem, so many problems? Because they... We are not the only living entities. There are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities. They're all being maintained by the Supreme Lord. In theBhagavad-gītāit is said thatsarva-yoniṣukaunteyamūrtayaḥsambhavantiyāḥ:[Bg.14.4] ""As many forms are there, in all different species,""ahaṁbīja-pradaḥpitā,""I am the Father."" The father maintains the sons, as we see actually. He's maintaining. So why you are so much...? Our father is rich. He's not poor. God is not poor.Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa.Six kinds of opulence fully. So why are you talking of this over-population, scarcity of food? Why? Actually the father is God. He's maintaining. And factually we see how many human beings, civilized human beings, are there. The other living beings are many hundred thousand times bigger quantity. If they can be maintained by God, what we have done, that He'll not maintain us? He'll maintain us. He's maintaining. So many people they say, ""India is starving."" I am Indian. I never see any man starving and died. I've never seen. This is simply advertisement. What is your opinion?"
Ambassador,There is poverty.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Ambassador,There is poverty.,Prabhupāda," Poverty, there is poverty in other countries also."
Ambassador,Also.,Prabhupāda," There, there also... Now India has got poverty. So why in America and Europe, there are hippies. Why?"
Ambassador,It's an express... It's another type of poverty.,Prabhupāda," They're also thinking that ""We are not sumptuously fed,"" or something. Some demands is there. Some demand. And they are lying down, Amsterdam and here, on the street. And why? But they are coming of rich families, rich nation. Especially America. In London also, I have seen. Regent Park. They're lying down. Police is kicking. Police is kicking: ""Get up, get up!"" Why? Behind them the British Empire is, British government is there. Why he's lying down there? Who has told him to...? Government is requesting, ""If you have no home, come on. I shall give you home."" In Bombay also, these, what is called? The huts?"
Haṁsadūta,Huts?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Haṁsadūta,Those tent huts?,Prabhupāda, They are on the... You have seen in Bombay?
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda," We passed, when we passed while coming from aerodrome to city..."
Ambassador,From...,Prabhupāda," So many thatched cottages, small. So Bombay government has given them home, that ""You come here, live."" But what do they...? they rent to some, another man, and they live in the... In Madras also, I have seen."
Ambassador,I know. That's true.,Prabhupāda, Yes. They don't like. They don't like. They want to...
Ambassador,"They roam, yes. It's what the gypsies did, you know.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambassador,When they were given houses in Moscow.,Prabhupāda," So there are differentprakṛtis.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27].So there are differentprakṛtis,different mentality. They want to live, eat. The eating, sleeping, mating, defending is there, but everyone has got different ideas. Just like you say, majority of people, they want to eat meat. They have got different mentality. But we don't want."
Ambassador,"In India, of course, not majority, I think it's a minority.",Prabhupāda," No, no. More..."
Ambassador,Most people are...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. In India, they're now being educated to eat meat. (Ambassador laughs) Otherwise, Indians, at least, Hindus..."
Ambassador,It is true. That's true.,Prabhupāda, Eh? They are being educated.
Ambassador,(laughing) I belong to vegetarian family. I eat meat now.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, in Madras, I have seen..."
Ambassador,Most of them...,Prabhupāda," Mostly they are vegetarian, strictly vegetarian. Actually, in Southern India, they maintain theHinduculture. You'll find big high-court judges, they have gottilaka."
Ambassador,That's true.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Strictly in Rāmānujasampradāya,or Śaivasampradāyathey have got... Strictly taking bath andtilaka.In New Delhi, you'll find so many Madrasi gentlemen, big, big, high officers, they're strictly followingHinduprinciples."
Ambassador,You'll be surpri...,Prabhupāda," And still, if I am correct, in Madras, they, there, there is not many Mohammedans. The Mohammedan culture could not enter..."
Ambassador,That's very true.,Prabhupāda," ...into Madras, Southern India. And you'll find also in ourCaitanyaCaritāmṛta... Now I am translating. WhenCaitanyaMahāprabhuwent to Southern India, practically whole Southern India becameVaiṣṇavaby His preaching."
Ambassador,It is a great period of...,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. And all theācāryas,they came from South India. Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya. I think Madhvācārya belonged to your province?Malaya?"
Ambassador,"No, Śaṅkarācārya came from...",Prabhupāda, Śaṅkarācārya.
Ambassador,"From Kerala. Sir, I have got a question. I have not really been able to locate when exactlyRādhāenteredHindumythology. Because theBhāgavatamdoesn't mention. They mention onlyrāsa-krīḍāas a... Before that, they were, beforeGaurāṅga,Caitanya, did you, do you have rendered exactly thebhakticult to take... TheRādhā-Kṛṣṇa, I mean. They were generally thegopīsand...",Prabhupāda," Otherācāryas,they elevated people up tosākhya-rasa."
Ambassador,Sākhya-rasa.,Prabhupāda," It isCaitanyaMahāprabhu, He gave usmādhurya-rasa."
Ambassador,Mādhurya-rasa.,Prabhupāda," Therefore aboutCaitanyaMahāprabhu, it is said,anarpita-carīṁcirāt.Anarpita-carīṁcirātkaruṇayāvatīrṇaḥkalausamarpayitumunnatojjvala-rasāṁ..."
Ambassador,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda, Anayārādhitaḥ.
Ambassador,"Oh, this is the beginning.",Prabhupāda," Anayārādhitaḥ.WhenKṛṣṇadisappeared fromrāsa-līlā,rāsadance, thengopīswent out to search Him out, and, at that time, they saw that onegopīis most beloved byKṛṣṇa.Anayārādhitaḥ.Therefore ""Rādhā."""
Ambassador,Anayārādhitaḥ?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Ambassador,"I do not know what we can do here, Your Grace, but we will be very happy to help them if they want any special material like dahl or any vegetables or... whatever it is... I think they are quite well.",Prabhupāda," Yes. We, we, we have no fixed income."
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda, ButKṛṣṇahas given us opportunity. Our books are selling... You have seen our books?
Ambassador,I've seen them in Moscow. One gentleman had a complete set. So I have glanced through them. Especially theBhagavad...,Prabhupāda, Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is?
Ambassador,"...translation, yes. And also theBhāgavatam,also.",Prabhupāda, Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is.
Ambassador,"Yes, this one, yes.",Prabhupāda," This is published by Macmillan Company. We are selling about more than one lakh copies per year through Macmillan Company. Yes. Similarly, we are selling our other books. Bring..."
Ambassador,The complete set I have seen. And also the other...,Prabhupāda, That is not yet complete.Bhāgavatamwill be finished in sixty volumes.
Ambassador,"Oh, sixty.",Prabhupāda," We have published only six volumes. Our manuscript is ready, but it requires great amount of money to publish."
Ambassador,And also...,Prabhupāda," But we are satisfied that in English-reading public, in Australia and America, in England, Europe—we are publishing in different languages—people are accepting our books very nicely. And lately that, one distributor..."
Ambassador,"Oh, I see.",Prabhupāda," This. No, not this. Where is that catalog?"
Haṁsadūta,"Brockridge, Keenan and Hall?",Prabhupāda," Ah, ah?"
Haṁsadūta,Catalog? I think we must have left that in London.,Prabhupāda," They are also distributing our books, Macmillan Company. People are... Now there will be a big meeting on the 12th, September, how to organize. Because this kind of literature was there, there was none before this. Thebhakticult, this was never presented to the western countries."
Ambassador,"Yes, yes. Mostly it was Vivekananda's explanation.",Prabhupāda, Vivekananda did not know anything aboutbhakti.
Ambassador,"No, I mean he just, literally, it's notbhaktiat all. Yes, it is...",Prabhupāda," Neither Vivekananda nor any swami. That is the regrettable fact. They, actually... Even Dr. Radhakrishnan, he could not presentBhagavad-gītāas it is. You see? He's impersonalist, and he presented in a different way, and now Professor, Dr. Pirindher...?"
Haṁsadūta; Śrutakīrti,Philinder.; Dillinger.,Prabhupāda," He said, he came to see me that ""Now we have rejected Dr. Radhakrishnan."""
Ambassador,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because everyone has speculated in his own way. Therefore we have presentedBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.And if you have got time, we can read some of the portions, how we have presented as it is. So people are liking thisAs It Is.Otherwise,Bhagavad-gītāis well-known in the western country, all over Europe. But because it was not presented as it is, there was not a single devotee ofKṛṣṇa. You find out, the whole history.Bhagavad-gītāis meant for making the reader a devotee ofKṛṣṇa. Is it not?"
Ambassador,That's true.,Prabhupāda," Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].So who can become fully surrendered toKṛṣṇaunless he's a devotee? So it is a transaction between God and His devotee. That's a fact.Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].These are the clear declaration. He's asking everyone, ""Just become My devotee. Always think of Me. Offer Me obeisances.""Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājī.""Worship Me.""Māṁnamaskuru.He, He is deprecating the worship of demigods.Kāmais tais tairhṛta-jñānāḥ.Find out this verse.Kāmais tais tairhṛta-jñānāḥprapadyante'nya-devatāḥ[Bg.7.20].Antavattuphalaṁteṣāṁtadbhavatyalpa-medhasām: [Bg.7.23] ""Less intelligent persons, they simply worship the demigods."" This is the statement."
Ambassador,"Most of... Well, I mean, I was a very political person. I must be very honest with you.",Prabhupāda," No, I'm talking of..."
Ambassador,"To me,Gītāmeans Gandhi'sGītāwhich said in a very distorted, very limited version...",Prabhupāda, Gandhidid not know anything aboutBhagavad-gītā.
