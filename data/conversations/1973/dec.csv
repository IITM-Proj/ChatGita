BaliMardana,HṛdayānandaSwami.,Prabhupāda," You, you were atheist?"
Hṛdayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So what is your view of atheist? What is your argument?
Hṛdayānanda; BaliMardana; Hṛdayānanda,"I don't know. I couldn't think of any good argument. They say that... No, it's not a good argument, though.; It's all one, isn't it.; Kīrtanānanda, his argument was, when he was an atheist, he said that actually the void is truth, and all categories or all varieties are illusion. So he said that we may think that actually spiritual variegatedness is transcendental, but that's actually also our illusion. That was his argument.",Prabhupāda, So what did you reply?
Hṛdayānanda,"I replied that if categories are illusion, then his talking is also illusion.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that's nice."
Hṛdayānanda,So I wouldn't let him say anything else.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes, very good reply. ""And you are also illusioned. Whatever nonsense you are talking, that is also illusion. Finish. Void, everything."" Then what did he reply?"
Hṛdayānanda,"He said... I just wouldn't let him say anything. Whenever he tried to talk, I just said, ""That's illusion."" [break]",Prabhupāda," This reply we give to the Māyāvādīs. So we speak to theMāyāvādīguru, that ""Whether you are inmāyā?Because everything ismāyā,so whether you are also inmāyā?"" So if he says, ""Yes,"" then how he can becomeguru?"
Karandhara,"ProfessorBharatisaid that. And when the students asked him, ""Isn't everything in this world illusion?"", he said, ""Yes, everything is illusion, but I like it very much.""",Prabhupāda, He likes it very much.
Karandhara,That's what he said.,Prabhupāda, Therefore he is a rascal. That proves that he is a rascal.
Hṛdayānanda,"After that debate, many, many people have boughtBhagavad-gītās.",Prabhupāda," Oh, then it is good triumph. Yes. (begins chantingjapa) [break] ...ponds like this, we remember immediately Bengal. Yes. In Bengal there are many, many ponds. (pause) What is called, this playing? What is this? Golf?"
Hṛdayānanda,Golf course.,Prabhupāda, They are coming for playing golfs?
Karandhara; Hṛdayānanda,"Yes, as soon as it's light, they'll be playing. They work hard all week so that they can play golf on Sunday.; They think that a gentleman should play golf.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is the fashion of the society."
Karandhara,A man is considered very rich if he can play golf every day. The rich men play every day.,Prabhupāda," It is very expensive, golf?"
Karandhara; Citraka,"Well, if you play golf, you don't have to work. People who are rich, they don't work. They just play golf all day. [break]; ...newspapers, that now he is follower of Śaṅkarācārya in India. The queen of Greece. She's a follower.",Prabhupāda," Queen of Greece. This cloth is very inconvenient... [break] ...illusion. Accepting this illusion, wherefrom the idea came? Just like in the tailor's window, there are nice beautiful women or men standing. That is illusion. Actually, that is neither man or woman. It is doll. But wherefrom the idea came of this illusion?"
Hṛdayānanda,Kṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," No, no. Unless there is a real man, a real woman, how the illusory man and woman is there, doll? Illusion means which is not fact. So the fact must be there; otherwise how the illusion, reflection, comes? Illusion is exemplified by the mirage, water in the desert. So the man is or the animal is running after water, but that is not water. This is illusion. But that does not mean there is no water. This is the conclusion. Unless there is real water, how... (aside) You can give around here. How this illusion of water is there?"
BaliMardana,Does that mean it is not possible to conceive of something that does not exist somewhere?,Prabhupāda," Yes, that is the real fact."
Karandhara,"Some of them say thatBrahmancreates illusion to forget that he isBrahman. They say thatBrahman,the one, creates illusion to forget that he'sBrahman. That's hislīlā.",Prabhupāda, It islīlā.Then you have to accept thatBrahmanis a person.
Karandhara,"Well, they say there is only one person. There's no varieties of persons.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. But you have to accept the origin, the person. That is our philosophy. Then you accept our philosophy."
Karandhara,"Then they say, ""Well it's not exactly a person, it's inconceivable.""",Prabhupāda," Therefore you cannot say that He is not a person, because He is inconceivable. You cannot say whether He is person or not person, because you are illusioned, and inconceivable... But why you are thinking that because you cannot say perfectly, everyone cannot say perfectly? You are thinking like that. Just like we have got experience: one body cannot say something, but the other can say. Practical experience. Just like this child cannot say something but the father can say."
BaliMardana,It's their envious attitude. They are envious.,Prabhupāda," No, no. It is not the question of envious. Because you are thinking that He is inconceivable, because you cannot say... But how can you say that another person cannot say? There are so many things I do not know. That does not mean that somebody else does not know. You may not know. Your experience is not mature. But how you can say, ""Another person cannot have the experience""? So that is answered in theBhagavad-gītā, vedāhaṁ samatītāni,māṁtuvedanakaścana:[Bg.7.26] ""I know everything, but nobody knows Me."" There is the answer. So nobody knowsKṛṣṇa. That's a fact. ButKṛṣṇareveals Himself to the devotee. That is also said,teṣāṁsatata-yuktānām[Bg.10.10]."
BaliMardana; Hṛdayānanda,It was raining very hard yesterday. Perhaps that's why.; All raining?,Prabhupāda, It may be rain water.
Karandhara,"Well, they fill it. Usually they fill it on Saturdays and Sundays.",Prabhupāda," Oh, that is it."
BaliMardana; Karandhara,It's too much for rain water.; They practice fishing.,Prabhupāda, Fishing?
Karandhara; Citraka,Fly casting. (pause) [break]; ...open a temple in Greece?,Prabhupāda," I would like to open temples in every village, every city, what to speak of Greece. But we haven't got sufficient men."
Karandhara; Citraka,This boy is from Greece.; I will translate the books later.,Prabhupāda," Oh, then you can open. But alone... You can be assisted with some of our men. That's nice proposal. We want to open in every city, every village, village to village. So go this way or around the...?"
Karandhara; Citraka,This isn't too bad. We can go this way. It's not too wet.; Sometimes you have said that the Greek mythology comes from thePurāṇas.,Prabhupāda," Yes, certainly. In Greece I think some people know of our movement. Because in the airport as soon as some young men saw us, they chanted ""HareKṛṣṇa!"" Yes. Maybe they are Europeans, but I had practical experience. [break] which..., that Park Avenue?"
BaliMardana,Wednesday they are having a meeting. Perhaps on Wednesday.,Prabhupāda, Wednesday. So you have to attend? No.
BaliMardana,"No, I don't have to attend. The lawyers attend. If I attend, it may ruin everything. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...one isyogi.Karmī,jñānī,yogiorbhakta.What is the difference betweenkarmīs, jñānīs,yogis andbhakta?"
Hṛdayānanda,"Karmīwants to enjoy the gross senses, thejñānīwants to enjoy the subtle mind, mental speculation, theyogiwants to manipulate the universe, mystic powers,...",Prabhupāda, Material power.
Hṛdayānanda,And a devotee has no material desires. (He wants) to serveKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And unless one is factually desireless, he cannot be happy. Thekarmī,jñānī,yogi, they are all full of desires. Therefore they are unhappy.Karmīsare the lowest of the unhappies,jñānīsare little advanced, yogis are little more advanced, and the perfection is thebhakta,devotees.Nadhanaṁnajanaṁnasundarīṁkavitāṁvājagad-īśakāmaye[Cc.Antya20.29,Śikṣāṣṭaka4].This isbhakta.[break]...siddhi-kāmīsakaliaśānta.Bhuktimeanskarmī,andmuktimeansjñānī.Andsiddhi,aṣṭa-siddhi,magic power, mystic power. That is calledsiddhi.Those who are practicingyoga, if they are actually yogis, they can haveaṣṭa-siddhi.Aṇimā, laghimā.They can become smaller than the smallest, heavier than the heaviest.Mahimā,prāpti.They can get anything they like. Ayogican get... Suppose if you want a pomegranate from Kabul, he will get immediately. Yes. That isyogi. As if he is snatching from the tree, yes.Prāpti-siddhi,īśitā.They can force their influence upon anyone.Īśitā,vaśitā.Yogis can hypnotize you. As he will say, you will act. As he will say, you will act. These yogis do that. They take something nonsense, ""Now take gold,"" and you will think it is gold. Just like magician do."
Hṛdayānanda,Hypnotist.,Prabhupāda," Hypnotist. They create heaps of money, the magician, I have seen it, all false."
Hṛdayānanda,"Like in theBhāgavatam,Arjunasaid like money created by magic word.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes.Prāpti-siddhi.Now we are flying by aeroplane. Ayogican fly without any instrument. As DurvāsāMuni, he went evenVaikuṇṭha-loka.NotVaikuṇṭha-loka.Within this planet, there is one planet where,Śvetadvīpa,LordViṣṇulives. He went there and saw LordViṣṇupersonally to request him to save him. He refused, ""No, I cannot. You go toAmbarīṣaMahārāja, beg pardon of him. If he pardons, then you will be saved."" So to a devotee, innocent devotee, he had to fall down on his lotus feet, ""Please save me."" So what is the power ofyogi?"
Devotee,Is the pure devotee more merciful thanKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda," Oh yes, yes. BecauseViṣṇucould not excuse him, but as soon as he came toMahārājaAmbarīṣa, fell down, and ""You take all my assets of pious activities. You be saved immediately."" That isVaiṣṇava.When he begged, humble, ""MahārājaAmbarīṣa, you save me, I am in danger."" ""Yes, you take all my pious activities' result. You be saved immediately."" That is devotee.Viṣṇurefused, ""No, I cannot give you protection."" Therefore he is more merciful, although he was attacked, he was harassed. Just likeArjuna.Arjunawas merciful, ""Let them enjoy. I don't want to kill them.""Kṛṣṇasaid, ""You must kill. You must kill. Why you are deviating from your path? You must kill."" Therefore he taught himBhagavad-gītā,just to induce him to kill. But he was merciful, ""No, they have done so much wrong to me, never mind. They are my relatives. I excuse. I don't want to fight."" Yes. This isBhagavad-gītā.You see?Arjunais more merciful thanKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇawanted to see them all killed because they were, I mean to say, offender to the devotee. Last time,Kṛṣṇasays, ""Arjuna, you fight or not fight, it is already settled. They are not going back home. They will be killed here. If you like, you take the credit. That's all. It is already settled."" ThenArjunaunderstood that ""My Lord is so persistent. (laughter) Why shall I resist Him? All right, I will do what He says."""
BaliMardana,"You are more merciful than any of them, Prabhupāda. You have come to the western countries.",Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa. Yes,Vaiṣṇavais, if one man is realVaiṣṇava. Just like see Jesus Christ. It is said that he took everyone's sins and he was crucified. So how much merciful he is, just see. But these rascals have taken, that ""Let us go on committing sinful activities, and Christ has taken contract. He will suffer. And we shall do this."" Such rascals. You see. They say that ""Our Christian religion is so good that even we commit sinful acts, Christ will suffer, we shall not suffer."" Just see."
BaliMardana,"I was reading yesterday in theNewsweekthat now the priests, they are dating with women and having sex.",Prabhupāda," They must have because they have no spiritual knowledge. Anyone who is not spiritually advanced, he cannot avoid the sex."
Hṛdayānanda,"You said yesterday,adānta-gobhiḥ.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Big, big yogis, they fell victim to sex.ViśvāmitraMuni, many other instances!Saubhari,SaubhariMuni. He was meditating within the water, and some fish just, what is called, licked up, his gender."
BaliMardana,Copulating.,Prabhupāda," Copulating, yes. And he felt sex desire, that itching sensation.Kaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham.Kaṇḍūyanammeans itching. It is actually itching. Theśāstrasays it iskaṇḍūyanam.Kaṇḍūyanammeans itching, the scratching, the itching.Kaṇḍūyanenakarayorivaduḥkha-duḥkham."
Devotee,Our scientist.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,Only one scientist.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa.Idaṁhipuṁsastapasaḥśrutasyavā[SB1.5.22].Feeling all right?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes. (indistinct) (pause) [break] Yes. I wanted to know the... So there are five kinds of air, material air, and the spirit soul is floating in the five kinds of air. I want to know these different functional activities of the five kinds of air.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that also we admit. There are five kinds of air.Prāṇa,apāna,like that. There are... By the yogis, by breathing exercise, they control the five kinds of air. So that also we admit."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, the scientists, they do not understand the five kinds of air.",Prabhupāda," They do not know so many things. What they will understand? Because they do not understand, therefore it has to be rejected. They are fools. What do they understand? Superfluous. Simply they see something outward. Just like they see the tree, but what do they understand about the seed? What do they understand? The tree is coming from the seed, but what do they understand about the seed? They see the tree, that's all. Like a child sees the tree and ""Oh, it is a big tree."" But intelligent man sees the seed."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They also see that the original seed the embryo is, remains dormant.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. How it is made? That they do not know, how subtle things are being done... (aside) We can go this way. That is their ignorance. They do not know subtle things. Simply gross manifestation attracts their attention. That's all.Jaḍā-dṛṣṭi.It is calledjaḍā-dṛṣṭi,material vision. Nosukhā-dṛṣṭi.Every, every field, they have no finer introspection. Simply gross. They deal with gross things. Just like the same example: Here is a tree, but it is a fact, this tree has grown from a small seed. So what do they know about the seed, how it is manufactured, how it has got the potency of bringing out such a big tree? Not only that, in that seed there will be millions of fruits, and each fruit there will be millions of seeds, and each seed contains again millions of trees. Where is your science? Where is that potency?"
Devotee,"Is a seed conscious, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," That is another thing. Everything is conscious. First of all, even gross manifestation we cannot understand, what to speak of consciousness. That is different thing. According to our philosophy, everything has got consciousness. Just like this tree has got consciousness."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The scientists also say that they have consciousness.,Prabhupāda," But this tree's consciousness and my consciousness is different. My consciousness is developed. If you pinch on my body, my consciousness will be immediately protesting. But you cut, it will not protest. So consciousness is different. So there is nothing which has no consciousness, but it is a question of degree. It is a question of degree. The more the consciousness is covered, it is called material. The more the consciousness is developed, it is called spiritual. That is the difference between matter and spirit."
Hṛdayānanda,"Prabhupāda, that verse in theGītā,thatnityaḥsarva-gataḥsthāṇuḥ.That verse in theBhagavad-gītāthat living beings are everywhere.",Prabhupāda," Yes,sarva-ga. Acalo 'yaṁ sthāṇursarva-gaḥ.Nitya.Nityaḥsthāṇur acalo 'yam.That is described. The seeds are everywhere. Just like they are trying to come out from this. You will find sometimes fracture, grass is coming. As soon as there is opportunity, they want to express the consciousness. Those who fall down...kṣīṇepuṇyepunaḥmartya-lokaṁviśanti.They come with waters, rain water, and falls down on the ground and become grass. Then gradually, evolution."
Hṛdayānanda,That's terrible.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Ā-brahma-bhuvanāllokāḥpunarāvartino...How subtle laws are working, what do they know the scientists? Therefore their so-called knowledge ismāyayāapahṛta-jñānāḥ,actual knowledge is taken away bymāyā.And they are thinking, ""I am very learned man, scholar."" But actual knowledge is taken away.māyayāapahṛta-jñānāḥ.Why?Āsuri-bhāva.They won't accept God. Therefore they are all fools. In spite of all these degrees, they are all fools. Therefore they cannot explain everything very nicely. ""In future we shall see."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are saying that ""We are beginning to learn more and more...""",Prabhupāda," Yes. That means that you are fool. While you are in the process of learning, that means you are fool. Say directly that we are fool. That is gentlemanliness. You do not know; still, youpose, ""I am, we are scholar, we are scientist. Give us Nobel Prize."" You see. This is going on. We don't want Nobel Prize. We are giving the topmost knowledge. We don't hanker after Nobel Prize. But they give false knowledge and hanker after Nobel Prize. Just see. Their real aim is how to get the Nobel Prize by cheating. That is their real aim. How an educated man, learned man will cheat? So therefore myGuruMahārājaused to say that ""This modern human society, or always, it is a society of the cheaters and the cheated."" Somebody is cheating and somebody's cheated, and they have combined together to make a so-called civilization."
Karandhara,"Prabhupāda, you know the scientist you quoted inEasy Journey?You quoted an article from the newspaper inEasy Journeyabout the two scientists who were studyinganti-matter?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,"Well, about a year ago another scientist came forward, and he charged that those two scientists actually stole the knowledge from him. They were working with him, and they stole it to win Nobel Prize.",Prabhupāda," Yes, there are many scientists like that. Just like this Marconi, he stole the knowledge from Dr. JagadishaCandraBose. You know that?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,I have heard this.,Prabhupāda," Yes. JagadishaCandra... I was present. He said that ""This man cheated me. I talked with him. Next morning he published the theory."""
Karandhara,About radio?,Prabhupāda," No, newspaper. Because both of them were friends, scientists, they talked. And he took the clue, immediately published the theory."
BaliMardana,Which theory was that?,Prabhupāda, That Marconi wireless.
BaliMardana,"Wireless, radio.",Prabhupāda," Yes, radio. That was JagadishaCandraBose's discovery. But the government will not give the credit to the Indians. Because JagadishaCandraBose happened to be Indian. These Britishers they are so much envious. Therefore they will never admit thatBhagavad-gītāwas spoken five thousand years ago. They bring all within the Christian period. That is their rascaldom."
Jayādvaita,"We went to a college and gave a class last week where the professor was saying that theBhagavad-gītāis only two thousand years old, like that.",Prabhupāda, Yes. They will never accept it.
Yaśomatīnandana,One stupid guy was saying that there is some quotation in theBhagavad-gītāfrom Book of John.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that is another rascaldom.Tavacārjuna."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about the heart transplant? The spirit soul is within the heart, but when the... in the medical science nowadays, the old heart can be replaced by a new one. So what happens with the spirit soul with the old one?",Prabhupāda, But that does not mean that new ones will increase their duration of life. That is our challenge.
SvarūpaDāmodara,But the personality is changed?,Prabhupāda, No.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Why not?,Prabhupāda," Why changed? Suppose if I sit from this chair to this chair, why I am changed? I can change my seat. It does not mean that I am changed."
Karandhara,Change the heart also. The heart can change.,Prabhupāda," The heart is seat, sitting place."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But the new heart had spirit soul from the new one.,Prabhupāda," Spirit soul, new or old there is. But if you can prove by changing the heart you can increase the duration of life, then you can catch the spirit soul."
Karandhara,That they're not able to do.,Prabhupāda, That is their nonsense.
BaliMardana,None of them have lived very long.,Prabhupāda," No, they cannot be. Because bykarmaṇādaiva-netreṇa[SB3.31.1],by superior arrangement,karmaṇā,you have got this body. So you have to live within this body certain age. So if you change the body, new, that doesn't mean you prolong your life. That is not possible. It is the duration of life, that is considered. They are thinking by changing the heart they will increase the duration of life. That is not possible."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So it is some sort of artificial transmigration?,Prabhupāda," Yes, like that. That transmigration taken... That is already explained inBhagavad-gītā.Just like a baby becomes a child, child becomes boy, boy becomes youth, like that. Transmigration it is going on continually. This is another type of transmigration. So it is a fact that by changing the heart the duration is not...?"
BaliMardana,"No, most of them, they have lived, a very short times. But still is it a fact that the soul is transplanted from one body to another body?",Prabhupāda," That can be done, yes. Sometimes yogis, they can perform that better body, he transfers himself into that body. Just Śaṅkarācārya did, yes."
Karandhara,"What they do, though, they wait till someone's dying or dead, and immediately after they die, they take the heart. From somebody who had the weak heart they transplant, change the heart.",Prabhupāda, So what...? There is no benefit.
Karandhara; BaliMardana,"But that does not mean that the soul from the old heart, or the new heart is being changed into the new body.; The soul has already left. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...the soul is individual. As I told yesterday that dead body has got the ingredients to produce life. But that the man who has left his body, you cannot produce him. That is the proof of individuality. That is the proof of individuality.Huh?"
BaliMardana,"I was saying that they transplant the heart... After the first man, his soul has already gone, then they take his heart and put it into the other man, who has a weak heart. So all it means is that the soul is going from one heart to another heart, not that the soul, that they are taking the soul with it when they put the heart in.",Prabhupāda, He is destined to live in that body for a certain years. So you may change whatever you like.
Karandhara,The heart is just an instrument in the machine.,Prabhupāda, Yes. It is a place.
BaliMardana,Now it's very clear. [break],Prabhupāda," Karmaṇādaiva-netreṇajantur dehopapattaye [SB3.31.1].There is superior overlooking. That isKṛṣṇa,anumantā,upadraṣṭā.Upadraṣṭāanumantā."
Karandhara,"One man, Dr. Wyberg from South Africa, he was the first successful heart transplant. So as soon as he got out of the hospital he started drinking and having sex life. (laughter) He was saying, ""How wonderful science is. It can prolong my enjoyment."" Then he died about a year later from too much...",Prabhupāda," That is material life. As soon as they get some opportunity, they will have sex. That is the only hope.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham[SB7.9.45].Here the only happiness is sex. Otherwise they are working so hard like asses. Why? Only for that sex. The only aim is ""I will enjoy sex at night."" That's all. That is the only aim.Yanmaithunādi.It is stated in theBhāgavata.Yanmaithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁhituccham.They are attracted with the most abominable thing, sex life. Yes.Tuccham.Tucchammeans very abominable, very insignificant thing. The position of the sex, the... How nasty it is! Just like crows, they enjoy in a nasty place. That is stated in theBhāgavata.Tadvāyasa-tīrtham.Vāyasameans crows. The crows, as they enjoy... [break]gṛhamandha-kūpam,ātma-pātam.As soon as you fall down, you are killed. You are killed. This example is given. That is stated inBhāgavata.When a woman comes to serve you, you must know it is covered well. As soon as you fall down, then you are finished.Hitvātma-pātaṁgṛhamandha-kūpaṁvanaṁgatoyaddharimāśrayeta[SB7.5.5].Therefore in the Vedic system firstbrahmacārī,becomebrahmacārī.Learn how to avoid sex, celibacy. That is first instruction. And if you are completely unable, all right, get yourself married. Otherwise there is no need of sex life. Why one should have sex life?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Then how to continue the species?,Prabhupāda," Why you will continue? You finish it, this condemned world, where you are simply suffering. Why should you continue it?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Because that is the laws of nature.,Prabhupāda," No, no, laws of nature if you want. If you want to be condemned, then laws of nature is there. Otherwise laws of nature is teaching you how to becomeKṛṣṇaconscious. Just like police. Police business is to make you lawful. If you become lawful, there is no question of police. There is no question of police law.Daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14].Māyāis kicking you one after another so that you may come to sense that ""This life is not good."" But we are so foolish that we say, ""No, it is good.""Yanmaithunādi.""There is sex life. Oh, it is very good."" This is the position."
Devotee; Hṛdayānanda,You give the analogy in theBhagavad-gītāthat it's like pouring gas onto a fire you're trying to put out.; He said like putting gas on the fire.,Prabhupāda," Ah. So increase the fire. Yes. But because we have got this body, we have to utilize it to make the best use of a bad bargain. Therefore marriage is allowed,gṛhasthalife is allowed, not for increasing sex life, but to finish it as soon as possible."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even in the very lower forms of life, there are some species, they reproduce without any sex? It's called asexual reproduction.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Oh yes. These bugs, bedbugs, they produce by this blood. You kill..."
SvarūpaDāmodara,We cannot check reproduction.,Prabhupāda," No, how can you check? There are so many living entities. They have come to this material world to enjoy. So the reproduction must go on. Just like you cannot stop the jail. You come out, but another is ready to enter it. That is not possible."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So it is within this material platform that we develop the consciousness by which...,Prabhupāda," That was answered byCaitanyaMahāprabhu. One of His devotee,VāsudevaDatta, he said, ""Sir, You have come. You take all the living entities of this universe and release them from this life. And if You think that they are so sinful, they cannot be, then give their all sins to me. But You take them."" SoCaitanyaMahāprabhusaid, ""Suppose if I take this universe, the all living entities, do you think the business will be finished? This universe is just like a mustard seed in the bag of mustard seeds."" (laughs) So from the bag of mustard seeds, if you take one mustard seed, what is the loss there? So this cannot be stopped. Soanantāyakalpate.There are so many, unlimited number of living entities. So this will go on."
Yaśomatīnandana,You said in theBhāgavatamthat the material world is like a correction house for the living entity.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,So everybody should developKṛṣṇaconsciousness.,Prabhupāda," Yes. (Śrīla Prabhupāda gets into car)Kṛṣṇaconsciousness is the only remedy.Harernāmaharernāmaharernāmaevakevalam...[Cc. Ādi17.21]. [break] And this advancement of material civilization means entrapping the entrapped. The living entity is already entrapped, and he is allured by farther entrapment.Jaḍa-vidyājatomāyāravaibhava.Jaḍa-vidyā,material advancement of civilization, means expanding the influence ofmāyā.Why? Nowanityasaṁsāra,cannot live here. You have to give up this place. But still, you are thinking to make it a permanent settlement. That is not possible. Everyone knows. He will not be allowed to stay. But still insisting, gorgeous arrangement, how we can be, how we can become immortal. The scientists bluffing, ""Yes, you will become immortal. We are finding out the means."" But he will die.

He cannot live here, he cannot stay here, he cannot enjoy here. That's a fact. But he is being allured. That means he is becoming more and more ass. Ass because they are believing still, ""No, by scientific method, we shall do that, we shall do that. We shall cure all diseases. We shall live for good. There will be no more death. And we are happy."" That means you are becoming... This material advancement of knowledge means you are becoming more and more asses. [break] (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When they say about the, how one starts talking about the origin of life, they say that one should first of all consider how the earth was formed, how this planet earth where we live, how it was formed, what is the origin of the earth.",Prabhupāda," Earth. Origin of earth is life. It is very simple to understand. Just like your body. Your body is... Or why your body? Take the tree. Tree is matter, it is earth. Wherefrom the big tree comes? From the life within the seed."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But they say that about 4.5 billion years ago this earth condensed in such a form, but before that there was no living entity because this earth was not suitable for it.",Prabhupāda," That is rascal. No, no. You have got history for billions of years?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," What is that history? We have got history thatBrahmāwas the first creation, and fromBrahmā...Brahmācreated this universe."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are saying that before, it was all gaseous dust particles and some gaseous materials which were floating and in due course it condensed and then it formed this...",Prabhupāda, So wherefrom the gas came? That they do not know.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yeah, they say it was just floating.",Prabhupāda," Floating where. Wherefrom the sky came? They are all nonsense. Simply speculating and consuming cheap money from the government. That's all. This is their business. The government is exacting taxes from the hard-working men, and these rascals are devouring this money. That's all. And making theories. That's all."
Hṛdayānanda,There was one big scandal where they found out all the scientists were just taking money. Even by material standards it was unnecessary. It was a very big scandal.,Prabhupāda, It must be they are scandals. They are after money. That's all. Not after knowledge. And what knowledge they have got? Simply speculating and befooling other fools.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].This is their business. One blind man is befooling other blind men. That's all.
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are very much convinced that this earth was gaseous. So there was no life at the beginning.,Prabhupāda, That may be. That may be that. But wherefrom the gas came?
SvarūpaDāmodara,It was just existing.,Prabhupāda," Bhinnāprakṛtiḥ.The answer is given.Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁmanobuddhiḥ[Bg.7.4].Vāyu,vāyugas, it came fromKṛṣṇa. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Vāyu.Vāyuis gas, is it not?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes. Air.,Prabhupāda," And finer than thevāyuis the ether, the sky. Finer than the sky is the mind. Finer than the mind is the intelligence, and finer than the intelligence is the soul. So they do not know this. They capture only middle thing,vāyu.Wherefrom thevāyucame? Wherefrom the gas came?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,That part remains unanswered. That part cannot be answered.,Prabhupāda," But we answer, we answer. We have got the knowledge. The gas came from ether, and ether came from mind, and mind came from intelligence, and intelligence came from the soul."
Hṛdayānanda,They will say you cannot prove that.,Prabhupāda," Yes, we can prove that."
Hṛdayānanda,How will you prove it?,Prabhupāda," You see still, gases, I mean to say, cloud is forming in the sky. But you have no eyes to see it."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"With this background before, then that is why they start saying that before Darwin's theory there should be one. That is called chemical evolution. That is called pre-biotic-chemistry. Means before biological evolution started there should be chemical evolution.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that chemical evolution is part of life demonstration. That I have already explained. Just like the chemical, citric acid, coming from lemon tree, a life. It is coming. So all chemicals are being produced... Just like in your body, in my body, there are so many chemicals. Because the body is there, the chemicals are coming. In my urine you will find so much, so many chemicals. In my stool you will find so many chemicals. Wherefrom the chemicals coming? Daily, enzymes, so many other chemicals are coming. Simply the medical man analyzes the urine, and so many chemicals are there. Wherefrom it came? Because I am living entity, the chemicals are coming in my urine, in my stool, in my cough, in my secretion. It is coming. Therefore it is concluded that chemicals are produced by life, not life is produced by chemicals."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But they are saying that once the seed of life, that is, the cells, the living cells, are built, then it continues automatically.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but who gives the seed? That is answered inBhagavad-gītā. Bījo 'haṁsarva-bhūtānām[Bg7.10]. Bījo 'haṁsarva-bhūtānām.He gives the seeds, and He is life."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But the scientists are now trying to make the seed.,Prabhupāda," Then kick on their face with boot. With boot, rascal. You are trying. That is rascaldom. We protest against this. ""We are trying."" What is this nonsense, trying? Do it immediately. Then we shall accept. Trying, everyone is trying. Just like a child is trying to build a house with this sand. So is that very nice proposal, that here will be house? That is childish. Then you accept that you are child in the field of knowledge. Don'tposeyourself that you know everything, or your knowledge is everything. That is our protest. ""We are trying."" Trying, everyone is trying. What is the difference between the scientists and ordinary man?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are saying that they are coming very close.,Prabhupāda," Oh! That is also another foolishness. That is called will o' the wisp. The ass. Ass is trying to get the grass, and the washerman is showing only, and the ass is advancing, the grass is advancing. (laughter) You see. This is their thing."
Dr. Wolfe,"But in all humility, Śrīla Prabhupāda, supposing that they would succeed in actually creating the living cell artificially, what would we say?",Prabhupāda, What is the credit there? It is already there. So what credit he can get?
Karandhara,Best they just imitated what has already happened.,Prabhupāda," Imitated. Just like, that I explained also. The example is that when an imitation barking is there, people go and purchase ticket. And when real barking is there, nobody cares. This is their business. They are so fool that their government is purchasing the ticket, and they're hearing the imitation barking. That's all."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But once they are successful they are going to make super beings they are called super beings, superhuman beings, super animals.",Prabhupāda," But they cannot create even an ant, and now they are going to make super beings. This is another foolishness. They cannot create even an ant, moving ant, and they're going to make super being. Just see. And we have to believe them. (laughter) We are not so fools. Your so-called scientists may be fools, but we are not so fools."
Yaśomatīnandana,You give the example of a potter who was dreaming...,Prabhupāda," Ah, yes, yes, That's it. A potter."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"This idea Śrīla Prabhupāda, about the chemical evolution, this idea came from, I think, in 1920 by a Russian scientist. He is a biologist. His name is Oparin. So he demonstrated that before biological evolution the atmosphere of the earth should be, he called, very much reducing. Reducing, that means it must be mostly full of hydrogens, no oxygen, very little oxygen, but mostly hydrogen. Then in due course because of the reaction in these hydrogen compounds and the radiation from the sunlight, then these compounds form into different chemicals which are...",Prabhupāda," That is a side study. But there was hydrogen. Wherefrom the hydrogen came? The scientists, simply they study in the middle. But they do not know what is the origin. Just like here is one aeroplane is coming, and you can say, ""All of a sudden a light came out of the sea."" Is that the study of this aeroplane? If we... the foolish person will see, ""All of a sudden, in the sea there was a light."" Is that scientific study? So your study is like that. ""There was this, and all of a sudden, by chance..."" That's it. That is not scientific study. We have to find out the original cause."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So in due course if they create these amino acids, there are 20 amino acids which are necessary for the body, for the material body.",Prabhupāda, But it is already created. What is your credit?
SvarūpaDāmodara,But they want to do it themselves.,Prabhupāda," You may do, but already... Just like there is a soap factory. You start another soap factory. So what is your credit? It is already there."
Yaśomatīnandana,"The big, big soap factory.",Prabhupāda," Yes. What is your credit? Yes. You can imitation, make an imitation. And you want to take credit, all credit, for the original creator, simply by imitating. You are so foolish. Why shall I give you the credit? I shall give credit to the origin. That is our philosophy."
Karandhara,"When they discover a natural law, they name it after themselves, like ""Newton's law."" (laughter)",Prabhupāda," It is already there, already there, and the rascal wants to take credit."
Yaśomatīnandana,They adjust a little bit and they say that they have conquered...,Prabhupāda, No adjustment. That is another foolishness. You cannot adjust. Even you cannot adjust a moment of nature's law. You cannot adjust.
Yaśomatīnandana,You just discover it.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No discovery. You do not know, arrangement. This is already there."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Practically they are fighting against the laws of nature, but sometimes they find pleasure in doing this.",Prabhupāda," That is childish. Just like they build with the sand palatial building, the children, and they take pleasure in it. That's all. That is children's pleasure. That is not sane man's pleasure.Māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43].Māyā-sukhāya.This pleasure ismāyā,and they are making humbug. Therefore they arevimūḍhān,vimūḍhān,all foolish men.PrahlādaMahārājasaid,māyā-sukhāyabharamudvahatovimūḍhān[SB7.9.43].The materialists, they have created a standard of happiness. That ismāyā.That is not happiness. But for thatmāyāhappiness, false happiness, they have beget a gorgeous arrangement. That's all. Therefore they arevimūḍhān.They are sovimūḍhān,so foolish. Now suppose they have created this nice comfortable civilization, but they have not created the situation that they will be able to enjoy it. At any moment they will be kicked out, ""Get out! Finished. All finished."" So where is that guarantee that you will be able to enjoy this?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is why the scientists are saying that God didn't give us everything so that we can make very happy.,Prabhupāda," Then God is there. Accept. Then why do you say there is no God? Then God is life. Then everything comes from life. You have to accept. That is our proposal. If they accept that ""God has not given us the capacity,"" then they are intelligent. They are accepting God."
Karandhara,"Well, they say, ""God hasn't given us everything because we are not able to live forever here.""",Prabhupāda, Why? That means God is controller. You are controlled. You admit this.
Yaśomatīnandana,"If these people are allowed to live forever then they will make this place more than a hell, worse than hell.",Prabhupāda," Yes. (laughs) God has given them everything actually, to live peacefully and try to understand God, but that they will not do. They will do something to try to forget God. That is their aim."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Prabhupāda, is it true that if a person is very sinful, he reduces some years from his life? If a person is very, very sinful, extremely sinful, then he reduces some...",Prabhupāda," Reduce or increase, what is the profit?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,We see the practical example. If you are alcoholic...,Prabhupāda," Even if you reduce or increase, suppose you are to live for hundred years, if you make it hundred and ten, so what is your profit? And if you are to live for hundred years, reduce time ten years, so what is the profit? You cannot live here, that is a fact, reduce or increase. This is all nonsense. What is increase? The trees, they have more longer period, increased the period, of life. Is, that kind of living is very profitable? What for increasing? To suffering? Your life is already suffering. Why you are covering this body? You cannot stand here, open body. That is suffering. You are trying to save yourself from the suffering. This is life, struggle for existence.Manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].Simply struggle. So if you increase your life for struggling again, then what is the profit? This is... The rascals, they do not understand. Even if you increase, what profit you will get? Your life is all suffering. So the foolish persons, they cannot understand. The real problem is how to stop your suffering, reduce or increase, it doesn't matter. But that you cannot do. You'll have to die. This is your suffering. Nobody wants to die. You have to become old man. Suppose an old man, suffering from so many diseases, and he increases his life. What is the profit there?"
Yaśomatīnandana,That is what they do by heart transplant.,Prabhupāda," This is all nonsense. Stop death; then it is an achievement. That's all. Stop disease, that is achievement. But that you cannot do. What is the profit reducing, and increasing or decreasing?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes. I am saying therefore, disease, not ""This disease"" or ""That disease."" Disease mean any kind of disease. That is credit. That is credit. If you guarantee that ""Here is a chemical composition; when a man takes it, no more disease,"" that is credit. But you cannot do that. Then where is your credit? You simply struggle. The struggle we increase. That's all.Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg.13.9].We shall come down? The water is coming or...?"
Karandhara; SvarūpaDāmodara,"Looks like the water is coming up, Prabhupāda.; The waves are very big.",Prabhupāda," Now, such a huge quantity of coloring, wherefrom coming, red color? And it will disappear after few minutes. Have you got any control over it, scientist?"
Karandhara,"Now there is a big scarcity of dye, coloring dye.",Prabhupāda," Ah, take from here red color. Yes, they can increase the scarcity. That's all. That is in their power."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But they will try to make more, reduce the scarcity.",Prabhupāda," Where is more? Now, because the petrol stock is decreasing, they are disturbed, increase it, increase it."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So they are trying to make synthetic...,Prabhupāda," Again ""trying,"" the same disease, ""trying."" (laughter) Same disease. Again ""trying."" That is called... That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā,manaḥṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇiprakṛti-sthānikarṣati[Bg.15.7].They are simply struggle, struggling with the mind. That is their business.Prakṛti-sthānikarṣati.Because he is in thisprakṛti,under the control of the material nature,prakṛti-sthāni—simply a struggle. And mental concoction: ""Now we shall do it. Now we are trying. In future it will be done.""Manaḥ.This is mind, mental concoction.Prakṛtiis doing their own duty, by nature's law. Now, by nature's law, the winter season is coming. Stop it. Stop it. Make it summer season. What you can do? Why so many cloths are required? Turn it into summer. You cannot do anything.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇi... [Bg.3.27]. Theprakṛtiis going on, doing its own duty. You cannot check. Now the sun is rising. Now make it dark. Or in the darkness, ask the sun, ""Get up."" Where is your power? And still you are thinking, that ""We are scientists. We are advancing."" All foolishness. Just surrender toKṛṣṇa.Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇam[Bg.18.66].What you can do? You cannot even know how many stars and planets are there. Still unknown."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Oh, they say in our universe there are about ten to the eleventh stars. They can count approximately. They say there are about 100 billion stars.",Prabhupāda," Count the sand grains, count the sand grains."
Karandhara,They would make a rough estimate.,Prabhupāda," That's all right. Even if you make a fool estimate, then still, you are nothing in the face of the creator. Even if you can count."
Yaśomatīnandana,"They are so stupid Prabhupāda that they do not recognize that the most important things in life is birth, death, old age and disease. And if they really want to conquer the nature, they should try to conquer birth, death, old age and disease.",Prabhupāda," That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,daivīhyeṣāguṇamayīmamamāyāduratyayā[Bg.7.14]."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Duratyayā,very hard to overcome.",Prabhupāda, It is not possible.
Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana,"They have a whole new department called gerontology to stop death. In one article they had about twenty different methods, and they said all of them, none of them have succeeded yet. But they were very confident.; Even for them there is some medicine in theVedas.If they go to heavenly planets they will be able to live longer. They are so stupid,śūdraclass, that they can't.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Yaśomatīnandana,"Even if they go to heavenly planets by followingVedas,still they will be able to live longer, but by their mundane efforts they will not be able to increase...",Prabhupāda," No, nobody... In the material world there is no question of living forever. That is not possible. That is in the spiritual world."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, when the scientists explain why there are so many varieties of living entities, they have an explanation.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They say, ""At the time of evolution, the cells, the genes, sometimes..."" Normally the gene is perfectly copied for the next generation, but sometimes there is a mistake in copying. Just like in the printing press sometimes we do some mistakes. Just like that, there are some mistakes along the path of evolution. So those mistakes, sometimes they just, according to the circumstances, they can stand, and they form a different living entity because of the difference of the genes.",Prabhupāda," But the mistake is continuing forever, because you'll find the varieties of living entities ever-existing. Therefore the mistake is permanent. So when it is permanent, it is not mistake. It is intelligence."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They'll say if there is no mistake, there will be only one living entity in the whole universe.",Prabhupāda," Why? Because you have got different mind, therefore you create different situation. Just like we are walking here. Not that everyone is coming to join us. Because they have got different mentality. They want to sleep. We want to rise early in the morning. Why this difference?"
Śrutaśrava,It is a great mistake they're making.,Prabhupāda," It is not mistake. It is your desire. And exactly according to the desire, you get a body. It is not mistake. No.Yaṁyaṁvāpismaranbhāvaṁtyajatyantekalevaram[Bg.8.6].At the time of death, whatever you think, exactly nature will give you a similar body. That's all. That is not in your hand. That is in the nature's hand.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27]."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But scientifically it can be proved that there is a mistake.,Prabhupāda," Then that is your mistake. In the laws of nature there is no mistake. There is no mistake. Your mistake. Just like in the railway carriage there is first-class, second-class, third-class. So you have purchased third-class ticket. By mistake, you can go to the first-class and just give him, but you will not be allowed to stay there. So it is your mistake. But these first-class, second-class, third..., that is not a mistake. That is arrangement. Similarly, these varieties... God is so clever that He knows that so many mistakes can be done, and so many varieties are there. As you commit mistake, you enter... ""You come here. It is ready."" And it is very exact mathematically calculated. Because the nature is working in three modes, so you mix up these three modes, it becomes three into three equal nine, and again you multiply nine into nine, equal to eighty-one. Again eighty-one into eighty-one. So many varieties come. Therefore generally it is taken, 84 million varieties. 8, 400,000. That is already there. Just like government creates a prison house. Although the city is not constructed, but they construct a prison house. Why? The government knows that ""There are so many rascals. They will be criminals, they must come here."" So it is not government mistakes. Your mistake. You become criminal and come here. It is your mistake. Why should you be criminal? That is your mistake."
Yaśomatīnandana,"And also, if nature made a mistake, then how could nature supply the necessities of all the living entities? After all...",Prabhupāda," No, no, there is no mistake.Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg.9.10].It is said,mayādhyakṣeṇaprakṛtiḥsūyatesa-carācaram.Under the supervision ofKṛṣṇa, God, nature is working. How there can be mistake? In theBrahma-saṁhitāit is said,sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktirekāchāyevayasyabhuvanānivibhartidurgā[Bs.5.44].This nature is working just like shadow. Real direction is from God.Icchānurūpamapiyasyacaceṣṭatesā.By His will, nature is working. So how He can be mistaken? Nature is working under the will of God; so how there can be mistake in the part of God? There is no mistake."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They use these terms to explain their proposed theory. This terminology.,Prabhupāda, Which terminology?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Like ""mistake"" and all these things.",Prabhupāda," Mistake, There cannot be... That is the difference between God and ourself. We are living entity, God is also living entity. But He has no four defects. We have got four defects. We commit mistake, we are illusioned, our senses are imperfect, and we cheat. God does not do all these things. That is the difference between God and ourselves. He does not commit mistake. He is not illusioned. He does not cheat, and His senses are perfect.Vedāhaṁ samatītāni[Bg.7.26]."
Dr. Wolfe,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, in technological enlargement or prolongation of our senses, we are also defective, of course.",Prabhupāda, Because we are defective. This material existence means defective existence. This defection not there.
Dr. Wolfe,"All the microscopes, and electric things, all these things, they are also defective.",Prabhupāda," Because it is made by the imperfect senses. So it must be defective. If you construct something with your defective knowledge, then it must be defective."
Karandhara,Even if they make a perfect microscope they still have to look at it through their defective eyes. (laughter),Prabhupāda," Yes. That's it. This is going on. Therefore whatever they are saying, they are all defective. Yes. That is our conclusion."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So it is just like playing with fire.,Prabhupāda, Mūḍhamūḍhamūḍhamūḍha.Defective meansmūḍha.
SvarūpaDāmodara,But they seem to be quite satisfied.,Prabhupāda," That, ass is also satisfied. By unnecessarily carrying the load of the washerman, he is satisfied. Everyone is satisfied. Even the worms of the stool, he is satisfied. (laughs) That is nature's law. He is satisfied. So this satisfaction"
Karandhara,"The saying is ""Even the pauper is proud of his penny.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. He is also... You see... InVṛndāvanaI showed you? The dogs were starving, but as soon as he gets another female dog, oh, he is satisfied. To have sex. Oh. You see. So is that satisfaction? He is starving. The belly has gone down, and still, he is satisfied with sex. You see."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That's called illusion.,Prabhupāda," Yes, this is illusion. Actually, he is not satisfied."
Karandhara,"You once gave the example, Prabhupāda of the drunkards in New York.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,If they just get a bottle of wine they are satisfied even though they are freezing and starving and have no place to stay.,Prabhupāda," Yes, they are satisfied. Real satisfaction will prevail when one knows God. That is real satisfaction.Bhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram[Bg.5.29].A devotee will see how by God's design the sea is working, how the sky is staying, how the sun is rising. He is satisfied, ""Oh, how my Lord is great, how He has arranged."" That is satisfaction"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But Śrīla Prabhupāda, the living entities, thejīvātmāwithin the..., and theParamātmāwithin, why the living entities suffering even theParamātmāis directing the living entity within?",Prabhupāda," That is not very difficult. Government is always with you, but why you are suffering, and why one is enjoying? Government is not partial. You have created your situation to suffer. That's all. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays that ""You surrender to Me. I will give you all protection."" But you will not do. You must suffer. Suffering is there. As soon as you are disobedient to God, immediately suffering begins. That ismāyā.ThereforeKṛṣṇasays, ""Now you give up all this nonsense business. Surrender to Me. I will give you all protection."" That you will not do. Then you must suffer. That is the song:"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So at some stage during the lifetime, especially in the human form of life...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,...one should come to the senses...,Prabhupāda, That is required.
SvarūpaDāmodara,...that they are suffering.,Prabhupāda," Not to speak likemadman. That you are scientists, you are, ""We shall solve all the questions."" This nonsense thing should stop. They should come to God and understand what God says. Then their life is successful. God Himself is speaking in theBhagavad-gītā.Just try to understand. This is not meant for the dogs and cats; this is meant for persons likeArjuna. BecauseBhagavad-gītāwas taught toArjuna—for enlightened, ah, topmost class of men. They'll understand.Imaṁrājarṣayoviduḥ.Evaṁparamparāprāptam[Bg.4.2].So be yourself amongst the topmost intelligent class of men and try to understandBhagavad-gītā.Then you'll be happy."
Devotee (1),"Prabhupāda, we should go this way.",Prabhupāda," Yes. But if you want to remain unhappy by your whims, then what... God cannot help you. But you have got the intelli..., independence."
Hṛdayānanda,"So Prabhupāda, if some people say, ""Well, I have no free will,"" that means that they are actually lazy.",Prabhupāda," Yes. You have got free will, but must utilize it properly. That is free will. Free will means to utilize it properly. That is free will."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So people... SometimesKṛṣṇainterferes in the free will?,Prabhupāda, Ah?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Our free will.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,God interferes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Because by your free will you are going to hell. IfKṛṣṇainterferes, that is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Just like a child is going to touch fire by free will, and father, ""Eh, don't do it."" That is his special favor."
Devotee; SvarūpaDāmodara,Jaya.; But it's called causeless mercy.,Prabhupāda," Ah? Causeless mercy. His mercy is already there, but we are denying the mercy. That is the defect of material existence."
Yaśomatīnandana,Spiritual master is the mercy of God?,Prabhupāda," Yes. God is distributing His mercy from within and from without. Without mercy is the spiritual master. Without means externally, just in front of you."
Devotee,Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā...,Prabhupāda, Ahhh!
Devotee,...bhakta-gaṇe.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa. [break] Impersonalist boys... [break] ...who are... [break] Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,What is life cannot be proved by experiments. So it is not necessary to talk about life now.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) Grapes are sour. (devotees laugh) The jackal's philosophy. The jackal came in the orchard of grapes and tried to take some grapes. He jumped many times, and when he failed, ""Oh, there is no necessity, it is sour."" It is jackal's philosophy. Sly fox."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They say that ultimately there may be no difference...,Prabhupāda," It isMāyāvāda,Māyāvāda.Māyāvādasaysbrahmasatyaṁjaganmithyā.This world is false. [break] ...so what... [break] ...prepared it, so he is the cause of this construction of the bench. How can you say there is no cause?"
Hṛdayānanda,Then they would say...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,"They would say, ""If everything has a cause...""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"""...then God also must have a cause.""",Prabhupāda," No, that is God, which has no cause. That is our definition. Everything has cause, but when it comes to a point where there is no more cause, He is cause and effect Himself, then that is God."
Devotee (1),"So then sometimes they say, ""Well, what's to say there will ever be original cause?""",Prabhupāda," Ah? [break] ...that is original cause. We... [break]...anvayād itarataścaartheṣuabhijñaḥsvarāṭ.Satyaṁparaṁdhīmahi[SB1.1.1].That is actual element,Kṛṣṇa."
Devotee (1),They would say that's impossible.,Prabhupāda," That is their ignorance. There is such a thing.Pūrṇasyapūrṇam. That is Vedic information. Thereforetad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumevābhigacchet[MU1.2.12].[break] Why not? Just like we can see materially that sunshine, for millions and millions of years it is shiny, still it is the same temperature."
Devotee (1),But it's diminishing.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee,The volume of the sun is diminishing.,Prabhupāda," No, because it is material. But we can understand that there... Of course, that is no... That touchstone. The touchstone can create gold. So unlimitedly it can create gold. Touchstone. So, even in material experience we'll find there is certain things which creates unlimitedly, still it remains."
Devotee (2),There's a starfish.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2),"There is a fish called the starfish. It has five arms, and if it loses one arm it will grow that arm back, or that arm will grow back four other arms.",Prabhupāda, (laughs)
Karandhara,That's just material generation.,Prabhupāda," No, no. I have already said there is an idea that even in the insignificant material element we find this, that one is lost, another's grown. [break] So when the Supreme Absolute Truth is there, how much potency? That is explained in theVedas.Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate [IsoInvocation].This is the idea of the Absolute. You take the complete from the complete, still it is complete."
Yaśomatīnandana,"They are so foolish that they have accepted an entity called infinity for the material purposes, from mathematics and everything, and they know that they are limited, but they will not accept that that can be a living entity which is infinite. They can accept that there's a new number called infinity, but they can't understand that there can be a living entity which is infinite too.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That number is matter. Living entity is always superior. So if in the inferior quality, matter, it is possible, how much it is possible in the superior quality."
Yaśomatīnandana,"And they also admit that they're limited, they also admit that they are fallible, so they also...",Prabhupāda," Because it is matter, it is limited, always limited. Although it appears unlimited."
Karandhara,They say they're limited but their process is not.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Karandhara,"They say their process, the scientific process, is not limited.",Prabhupāda," That is another nonsense. If you are limited, how you can manufacture process... [break] ... is bogus."
Karandhara,They don't say... They say they haven't manufactured it. They've just discovered it.,Prabhupāda," No, if you are limited, how can you discover the unlimited? Then what is the meaning of limited? You cannot discover..."
Devotee (2),"But if I am limitedjīva,I can discoverKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda," Ah? No, you do not discover."
Yaśomatīnandana,It's there in...,Prabhupāda, But you know from higher authority. You cannot discover it.
Devotee (2),That's right. [break] Also... [break] ...does it not?,Prabhupāda, This is conservation.
Devotee (2),Actually the material world is never annihilated.,Prabhupāda, Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate [IsoInvocation].
Devotee (2),Doesn't it rest in Viṣṇu's body?,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Devotee (2); Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana; Devotee (2); Yaśomatīnandana,"When the material world is annihilated, it still is there, is it not?; That's in theBhagavad-gītā,the five elements are all eternal...; I understand that the process is eternal, Prabhupāda said.; No, no, no, the five elements are eternal.; ...each universe...",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Devotee (2),The five elements are eternal.,Prabhupāda," Eternal, but it is manifested and not manifested. Just like conservation of energy. That is the... Energy is manifested, sometimes not manifested. [break] But nonmanifested does not mean that... [break] ...energy."
Karandhara,"But the definition of the Absolute Truth is inconceivable, so it must violate the logic.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Karandhara,Their logic...,Prabhupāda," No, it's inconceivable by them, not by us. Therefore we call them fools. It is not inconceivable by us. But so you know the Truth from the Truth, Absolute Truth. A layman or a foolish boy does not know where..., which side the sun will rise. His father can say, ""This side it will rise."" That is the difference. Because he knows how to suggest which side, because there is reddish, how do you say? Illumination. He knows that ""This side it will rise,"" by the symptom. Both of them, the foolish man and the intelligent man, just at present do not see that where is the sun. But the intelligent man knows ""Here is the sun,"" although the sun is not visible both to the intelligent and foolish man. That intelligence means he knows how to find out where is sun. That is intelligence. And this is not discovery. I am intelligent speaking ""This side is sun."" It is not my discovery. I have heard from authority that from the eastern direction the sun rises, so I know it."
Yaśomatīnandana,"They're so stupid they name it Absolute Truth, but still they try to make their own theories about the Absolute Truth.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,In the Vedic literatures it is stateddharmaṁtusākṣādbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].They can't even understand a simple thing.,Prabhupāda," No.dharmameans the codes, the laws of God.Sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekam...[Bg.18.66]. This isdharma.Kṛṣṇasays that ""You give up your nonsense manufactured religion. Here is religion. Surrender unto Me."" Who will deny? Any religious person will accept it. Who will deny it? This isdharma.Kṛṣṇasayssarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].So who will deny? Who is that man who will deny this statement, that one has to surrender to the Supreme? Who will deny it? Therefore it isdharma.You have to submit, just like the government. The government is the supreme, who will deny? Who will deny?"
Hṛdayānanda,Only the criminal.,Prabhupāda," Only the criminal. And he'll be punished, that's all. The result, he'll be punished. Beaten with the shoes of policeman, that's all."
Karandhara,Some people get away with it.,Prabhupāda," For some time he'll get away. You can get away from the police custody, but you cannot get away frommāyā'scustody. That is not possible."
Karandhara,"But because in all material examples there are exceptions, they say. In all material examples there are exceptions, so they try to find that exception.",Prabhupāda," Many exceptions are there,māmevayeprapadyante.Those who are devotee, they are not undermāyā.Māmevayeprapadyantemāyāmetāṁtarantite.If you do not violate the laws of God... [break] ...there is no question of being... [break]...bymāyā.If you surrender... [break] ...ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66].[break] ...if the government protects everyone who is surrendered to the laws of the God, government. The government will give all protection. If he is a law-abiding citizen, he must be given protection, all protection."
Hṛdayānanda,"You're too intelligent for the atheists, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,You're too intelligent for the atheists.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) Atheist means criminal, they're punishable, that's all. And the more people becoming godless, they're being punished by nature."
Devotee (2),Actually by the law of conservation of energy reincarnation can be explained.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),By their own law.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda; Devotee (2),Why shouldn't consciousness also be conserved?; Consciousness is also energy.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Energy of the soul. As soon as the soul is passed from the body, there is no more consciousness. It is very easy to understand. They cannot explain why the consciousness stops. They cannot explain. But that is the symptom.Yenasarvamidam,avināśitutadviddhi...,yenasarvamidam,in theBhagavad-gītā.That thing which is spreading the energy all over the body, that is eternal. Now, what is that thing which is spreading the consciousness? It is the soul. So long the soul is there, you have got consciousness, otherwise there is no consciousness. Very plain word.Avināśitutadviddhi.Just try to understand that thing which is spreading consciousness all over the body. Just like a small grain of poison. As soon as you take it, immediately it will spread all over the blood. Even a small grain. And then how much powerful is that spiritual spark?"
Devotee (2),So the grain is carried by the blood. What is the spiritual spark carried by?,Prabhupāda," Spiritual spark is not carried by, but he resides within the body. He is carried by his ownkarma,subtle, subtle desire is carried. Everyone is carried by his desire. Why did I come here, in America? I have got a desire to preach; therefore I've come. Otherwise I had no business to come here. So desire. So desire carries you. That is, the rascals, they do not know. Desire is there, they cannot see, but desire is there. Mind is there, intelligence is there; they cannot see. That is carried. The example is given, just like the aroma of a flower is being carried by the air. And nobody can see, but one can feel, ""Oh, it is very good, nice aroma. Wherefrom it is coming?"" But he has no eyes to see either the aroma or the air. Similarly, the soul after destruction of this body is being carried by the desire, but they have no eyes to see what is that desire, what is that soul, what is that intelligence. They are saying, ""There is no soul."" This is mostly stupidity."
Hṛdayānanda,So...,Prabhupāda, Simply stupids.
Hṛdayānanda,"So if someone isKṛṣṇaconscious, then nothing can be hidden from him.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Hṛdayānanda,"If someone isKṛṣṇaconscious, then...",Prabhupāda," Yes, because he learned fromKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasaysavināśitutadviddhiyenasarvam,najāyatenamriyatevā...,nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].So we are...Kṛṣṇaconsciousness means you are taking whatKṛṣṇasays. Therefore... [break] And then you judge in your own way, you'll find, ""Yes, it's all right.""Avināśitutadviddhiyenasarvamidaṁtatam.At the present moment, because your, these blunt eyes cannot see the soul, you have to learn it by appreciation.Avagama. It is calledavagama.(?)Appreciation. Just likeKṛṣṇasays thattadviddhi,that, that thing which is spreading consciousness, that is soul. Now you can perceive there must be something which is now absent, otherwise why there is no consciousness? Where is the difficulty? If you do not see, you can't understand it. Just like the same example, when good aroma is carried. So somebody says, ""This good aroma is coming because the air passing through a flower garden, therefore this aroma."" Now this is a fact, but you cannot see the aroma or the air. But you hear from an experienced man. That is the way of understanding which is beyond your sense perception. But these rascals, simply they are depending on their blunt senses, these stupids, so-called scientists. Therefore they're stupids. They simply believe on their eyes. They do not know how much defective these eyes and senses are, incomplete. That they do not know. They believe on their defective senses.Akṣaja. Akṣaja, akṣ...Experiment. Everything experimented.Vedasays don't try to explain which is beyond your sense. How you will explain? It is not possible.Acintyāḥkhaluyebhāvānatāṁstarkeṇayojayet. It isacintya,it is beyond your conception. Why you are wasting your time?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But a scientist will say that ""I can show you what the aroma looks like.""",Prabhupāda," They cannot show you, that is another stupidity. (indistinct) anything. Who can deny thatKṛṣṇasays thatavināśitutadviddhiyenasar...,there is a thing within the body which is eternal? And what is that thing which is spreading consciousness? And you show what is that thing which is spreading consciousness. Then I shall accept you as scientist."
Karandhara,"They would say, ""How can we believeKṛṣṇa?""",Prabhupāda," No, you don't believe, that here is a fact! That there is something within the body which is spreading consciousness. That is eternal. There's no question of believing. It is a fact. Now you show, what is that fact? Where is that fact?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,They'll say it's just biochemical reactions.,Prabhupāda," Biochemical... You simply do it, rascal. You cannot do it. (Hṛdayānandalaughs) You rascal, simply speak, but you cannot do it. That is our contention."
Hṛdayānanda,Jaya.,Prabhupāda, Therefore you are rascal. You speak something which is beyond your power.
Yaśomatīnandana,Prabhupāda solves...,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore it is simply cheating people. And we,Kṛṣṇaconscious men, we want to stop these cheating, any way..."
Karandhara,They'd say we also cannot prove the soul is eternal.,Prabhupāda," No, there is proof. There is something. We accept it, but you don't accept it. There are so many things, there are so many things. You do not see, but still you accept it. Just like without father there cannot be son. Now you have not seen your father, but mother says, ""Here is your father."" You have to believe it. It is a fact."
Karandhara,But they can experience being a father themselves.,Prabhupāda, Ah? Ah?
Karandhara,"They can experience that, 'cause they can be a father themselves.",Prabhupāda, They can be father themselves?
Karandhara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, What is that? Without son how one becomes father?
Karandhara,"No, but they... That example falls within the range of their experience, because they can also be a father.",Prabhupāda," No, not to your experience. But a superior experience, say mother."
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Not your experience. You cannot say by experience who is your father. Your mother can say.
Karandhara,"No, but the example that I have a father can be appreciated because I can also be a father.",Prabhupāda," But therefore if that appreciation is there, thatavināśitutadviddhiyena...,the consciousness is spreading from the soul, so you have to appreciate there must be something from which consciousness comes. That you cannot deny."
Karandhara,They say it is biochemical development.,Prabhupāda," No, but then you replace consciousness by a biochemical combination. That you cannot do."
Devotee (2); Karandhara,"When the baby is born dead.; But just because they say, ""Because we can't do it yet...""",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. You cannot do, therefore you are rascal. You're talking all nonsense. You cannot do it, how you speak?"
Karandhara,Up till two hundred years ago they weren't able to fly...,Prabhupāda," Want two hundred..., no, we want immediately, we don't want blank check. (devotees laugh) Rascal blank check."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Prabhupāda, we can go this way.",Prabhupāda, Postdated blank check. (devotees laugh) We don't believe. We must have real cash.
Devotee (2); Karandhara; Devotee; Devotee,"And then they will admit actually that their senses are...; No, then they'll want to see the soul...; ...are limited.; ...they want to see a soul as eternal.",Prabhupāda, (aside:) Which way?
Devotee,Go to one life to another life.,Prabhupāda, Which way?
Devotee; Devotee; Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana,"Which way?; This.; Where is...?; Prabhupāda, actually this knowledge is so absolute, in theBhagavad-gītāit is said thatpratyakṣāvagamaṁdharmyam.You can actually experience...",Prabhupāda, Yeah.
Yaśomatīnandana,...just by takingbhaktiyou can see that your purification comes...,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Yaśomatīnandana; Karandhara,"...and actually intelligence comes fromKṛṣṇa. So if actually one is sincere, thenKṛṣṇawill give him intelligence that ""Yes, actually there is a soul, and actually I'm the Supersoul.""; That intelligence is defective",Prabhupāda," No, no, my senses are defective. But the source from which I know, that is not defective. I cannot experimentally know who is my father. But the source from whom I understand, that is perfection."
Yaśomatīnandana,"In other words they'll get confirmation within their heart. They'll be satisfied, that ""Yes,Kṛṣṇais God,"" if they are sincere.",Prabhupāda," Yeah. If they are sincere. That is thebudha.Budhābhāva-samanvitāḥ[Bg.10.8].Others, rascals cannot (indistinct).Mūḍhanarādhama.They cannot."
Devotee (2),They'll say you're sincerely brainwashed.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2),They'll say you're sincerely brainwashed.,Prabhupāda, Brainwashed? Why? These are facts.
Yaśomatīnandana,But we still have some basis...,Prabhupāda," If you cannot reply, you're simply misrepresenting scientists. We say there must be something which is spreading consciousness. Now how can you deny it? It is not brainwash. There must be something. Now if you are scientist, you find out."
Hṛdayānanda,That which is spreading consciousness.,Prabhupāda, Yes. What is that thing which is spreading consciousness?
Hṛdayānanda,"So if they say it is the chemical, but they can't do that, they can't...",Prabhupāda," Yes, you put the chemicals. Just like I have sent my car, it is not running, so they know how it will run. They know. Therefore I say, ""But if you do not know, you're speaking nonsense. You do not know anything."" And as soon as you are captured, you say ""Yes, in future I shall know."" What is this? The same, postdated blank check, which has no value. Will the postdated check, will it be accepted by anyone? Suppose you give me a postdated check. If I'm paying, what is this nonsense? This is all nonsense. ""Future."" (devotees laugh) No future, sir. Immediately. Cash payment."
Hṛdayānanda,So that's cheating.,Prabhupāda, Ah. That is cheating.
Karandhara,"But they'll say, ""But you also cannot show us.""",Prabhupāda," No, I can show you. I say, there must be something. There must be something."
Karandhara,We say it's a spirit; they say...,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be there, I say ""something."" You find out that something. I say something. I don't say spirit, matter or anything. Something."
Karandhara,"Yes, they say that they look...",Prabhupāda," Ah, that is their cheating. Find out now, and I accept that they're scientists. Yes. Cash money, sir. Then I shall know that you are rich man. You want to cheat me with the paper?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"That's why they'll say that ""We are doing research.""",Prabhupāda, That means that... Then don't talk that you are scientists. You are student. You are trying to learn. You're student. You cannot say that you are scientists.
Hṛdayānanda,"So regardless of our position, they are not qualified.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Hṛdayānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Their system is to remain a student andposeas teacher, their system. They're trying to learn it, and still they're posing as teacher. Teacher means one who knows. He does not know; still he poses in the post of a teacher."
Hṛdayānanda,So the system cannot be good because it does not purify their character. They still cheat.,Prabhupāda," No, they're cheating simply. Little knowledge, cheating. Little knowledge."
Yaśomatīnandana,"They're simply likeneti neti.""Not this, not this.""",Prabhupāda," ""Not this."" Yes. By negation. Definition by negation. Not positive definition. They say ""it is not this."" But what it is they cannot say."
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is their process.
Hṛdayānanda,It is not God but...,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Karandhara,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Ah?
Karandhara,Either they accept our evidence or...,Prabhupāda," No, therefore they are fools. That is a fact. Any child can understand that... And even they're less than a child. If I say there is something, therefore there is consciousness, any boy can understand. But they cannot understand. Less than a boy."
Karandhara,They say there's no proof that that something...,Prabhupāda, That is the proof. That is the proof.
Devotee (2),"Yes, their own law of conservation.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,"No, I'm talking about the individuality...",Prabhupāda," No, no. Individuality... There are so many proofs, there are so many proofs, how you can say it is not?"
Devotee (2),By their own laws.,Prabhupāda," No, no, not that. It is different subject. That something is missing within the body, therefore it is dead. So what is your answer? We say something is missing. We shall decide what is that something later on. That something is missing. If you suggest that something is chemical combination, then you do it. Therefore do not know. I say something is missing. If you know, then you replace that something, then you'll know."
Karandhara,What do we say that something is?,Prabhupāda," No... That everyone, any layman can understand, that this dead body is unconscious because something is missing. Any layman can understand. If you know that, then you replace it. I don't say I know, but I say something is missing."
Hṛdayānanda,Jaya.,Prabhupāda," You have to accept also that. But if you know that something, then you replace it. Otherwise you also do not know. Then why you are talking of big, big word? You do not know."
Devotee,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, But something is missing. That is accepted by everyone.
BhaktaDāsa,(laughs) So we both don't know.,Prabhupāda," Ah? No, I know better than you. Because you are a fool, I'm a fool, but you are a fool and still you are posing you know. That is the difference."
Karandhara,"They may say, ""We don't know, but we're trying to find out.""",Prabhupāda, That also... Then why I shall give you better position?
Karandhara,We are also trying to find out.,Prabhupāda," Then why should I give you better position? You're on the same level with me. Why you are posing as ""I am scientist""? You are a fool, you admit I am fool, you admit you are a fool. But why you are posing as scientist?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Because they will say that they have a..., they are trying to find out experimental things.",Prabhupāda," You have not found out, that's a fact. As I have not found, therefore you are equally fool like me. Don'tposeyourself better than me."
Karandhara; Yaśomatīnandana,"If we're both fools...; But at least we are accepting some authority which is supposedly very authorized by great saints, sages...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,They have also great authorities.,Prabhupāda," And all the authorities... No, therefore these persons who do not accept authority, they're rascal."
Karandhara,They are accepting authorities.,Prabhupāda, But they're accepting authority who is not authority.
Devotee; Devotee (4),"They're fools.; Darwin, they're accepting Darwin as authority.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,"They say, ""But why should we accept any one of your authorities?""",Prabhupāda," No, then you come to argument, reason, then whether Darwin is authority orKṛṣṇais authority, we have to decide."
Devotee,Jaya!,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,"They accept like, ""I have not seen President Nixon, but I accept because I read in the newspaper."" So somebody says that, well, by following thisbhaktiyou can seeKṛṣṇa, but they will not accept that.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),Why should they acceptKṛṣṇaas authority over Darwin authority?,Prabhupāda, Ah? Because He's accepted by...
Yaśomatīnandana,Great sages.,Prabhupāda," ...great sages, saintly persons, scholars..."
Devotee (2),By many scientists.,Prabhupāda, Then fool's paradise it is called... It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. That is the only conclusion.
Karandhara,That's what they say about us.,Prabhupāda," Because this world is all full of fools, so it is very difficult to push on. That we know. Therefore we should not go to themūḍhas."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Birds of a feather flock together.,Prabhupāda, (laughs) Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,"So they can go to Darwin's planet, we'll go to Kṛṣṇa's planet.",Prabhupāda, Yes. (laughs)
Devotee,But how will we defeat them?,Prabhupāda, Yāntibhūtejyābhūtāni.
Yaśomatīnandana,By giving themprasādam.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Yaśomatīnandana,"We'll defeat them by giving themprasādam,right, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," To cure their disease, you have to give themprasādam,and give them chance to hearHareKṛṣṇa. This is valuable. Just like a man suffering from jaundice, he sees everything yellow, and if you say, ""No, it is not yellow. White"" ""No, I see yellow."" What can be done, then the medicine has to be given. He'll never say it is white. He'll say it is yellow, because he is suffering. You have to cure. TheKṛṣṇaconsciousness method is curing the disease of jaundice."
Hṛdayānanda; Devotee (2): ,"In other words, Prabhupāda, unless there are enough gentlemen to accept saintly persons, we cannot talk to them. [break]; ...we have to defeat them byprasādam.",Prabhupāda," Yes. No, we have to show them mercy. It is not a question of defeat. Just like a diseased person is talking nonsense, so doctors takes care, ""All right, go on talking nonsense. Take this medicine."" (devotees laugh) That is hospitalization."
Yaśomatīnandana,They're already defeated.,Prabhupāda," Yeah, already defeated by nature.Māyayāpahṛta-jñāna. That is stated,apahṛta-jñāna.Māyāis taking their all knowledge, and becausemāyāis taking their all knowledge, the preaching is required. [break]"
Yaśomatīnandana,"So why wouldn't, why couldn't they accept that such simple thing?",Prabhupāda," They're not wise.Mūḍha.Namāṁprapadyantemūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15]. Because they always engage in sinful activities. These are the sym..., cause of their disease. They're sinful, they're rascal, lowest of the mankind, and whatever knowledge they are proud of, that ismāyā, and the basic principle is they'reasuras, atheists."
Yaśomatīnandana,Just like a prisoner trying to demand explanation from the King...,Prabhupāda, Let us go (indistinct).
Karandhara,"Prabhupāda, we should go straight back; it's getting late.",Prabhupāda," Ah? No, no. What is the time now?"
Karandhara: ; Prabhupāda: ; Devotee,Quarter to seven.; Quarter to seven?; Yeah.,Prabhupāda, All right.
Devotee (2),"Śrīla Prabhupāda, when someone is sick, he willingly goes to the doctor.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee (2),So...,Prabhupāda, That is the injunction of the Vedas.Tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurumeva...[MU1.2.12]. Therefore these rascals should go to a bona fideguru.
Devotee (2),So how we can get them to willingly come...,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2),...to theguru?,Prabhupāda," Just like if you are diseased, you are suffering the pains, so naturally you shall be inclined how to reduce the pain, how to get out of..."
Devotee (2),But the scientists...,Prabhupāda," But these rascals, even though are suffering three kinds of pains,tri-tāpa-yatna.Just like why you are covered? Because there is pain. Severe cold, similarly severe heat. So we are suffering, either summer season or winter season. We are suffering,tri-tāpa-yatna. There is suffering from our mind, from our body—this is natural suffering. There is bodily suffering, mental suffering, then suffering caused by other living entities. So we are always suffering. But still they're thinking that ""We are happy."" The disease is already there. Ah? Just like the Arabian do not want to give you petrol. That means there's suffering caused by other nations. So this is going on. They're simply trying to settle up. But the suffering is there. But they're not in their knowledge, that in spite of all their endeavors, the sufferings are there. What is the cause? Then whom shall I go to ask why the suffering is there?Tad-vijñānārthaṁsagurum[MU1.2.12]. Therefore you must approach a person who knows how the suffering should be mitigated."
Yaśomatīnandana,"But there's so many so-called gurus, Prabhupāda, how...",Prabhupāda, Then you cannot go to the so-called.
Yaśomatīnandana,How can you convince that we are the real genuine people?,Prabhupāda," That you will have to learn, just like you have to go to school, there is injunction. But if you do not know what is school, go to a cow farmer(?), then that is your fault. If I say, ""You go and purchase this from the market,"" suppose you have to purchase gold, but you go to a storefront, milk seller, how you will get the gold? That intelligence you must have, that where gold can be had. You must go to the person who is dealing really with gold. But if you do not know, then you will be cheated. That much knowledge you must have."
Hṛdayānanda; Devotee (2),That is book distribution.; Just like there are some good schools and some bad schools.,Prabhupāda," And because now they're so fallen, they do not go, neither they know; therefore we are canvassing, ""Here is a school."""
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda," That is our business. ""Here is knowledge, come on."""
Yaśomatīnandana,Still they won't go.,Prabhupāda, That is their misfortune.
Yaśomatīnandana,This is the only knowledge. Everybody else is distributing ignorance.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Prabhupāda: ; SvarūpaDāmodara,"Sometimes questions are raised saying that how do we know that a bird is more intelligent than a human being.; Yes, bird is more intelligent.; But we are posing that...",Prabhupāda," Just like, just like, here is a bird, as soon as he see so many men are coming, he'll jump over you. You are not intelligent to jump over. Suppose someone is coming to stab you; you cannot jump. Therefore bird is more intelligent."
SvarūpaDāmodara,How do we know that they're not (indistinct)?,Prabhupāda," Ah? No, they'll know enemy is coming, even if he says, animals they know. As soon as there is enemy, they take protection."
Devotee (2): ,But they take the hook.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2): ,But the fish take the hook.,Prabhupāda, Hook?
Devotee (2): ; Prabhupāda: ; SvarūpaDāmodara,"When the man is fishing with the hook, the fish that takes the hook...?; That ignorance is there, but the hook... Not only out of ignorance, out of greediness. That if you become more greedy, he knows that there is sufficient food in the sea, but the rascal is greedy, he's taking another... Due to his rascaldom, he's dying. Greediness. So similarly, all arrangement is there, God-made. Even for human beings. But because they're rascals, they're greedy. They're greedy. Although their greediness cannot satisfy them, everyone is greedy because the law of nature is equal to everyone. If law of nature can supply food to the birds and beast and everyone, why not to the human beings? What human being has done? But they're rascal, greedy, therefore suffering. More, wants more. There is already food grains, milk, flowers, fruits, immense supply, but he'll cut the throat of another animal. Greedy. And they're suffering, committing sinful activities.; We're getting information that only in the human form...",Prabhupāda," Wherefrom information? Another rascal? What is that information? If you get information from another rascal, what you'll get benefit? The source of information must be perfect. Then you get information, it is all right. If you are a rascal and if you get information from another rascal, then what is the benefit?"
Karandhara,They'd say there is no perfect source.,Prabhupāda," Because you are not... You're cheater, you're cheater, you are cheated, therefore that is your version."
Karandhara: ,We are imperfect. How do we know what a perfect source is?,Prabhupāda," No, I do not know. Therefore it is said,tad-vijñānārthaṁgurumevābhigacchet. You must know from the person who knows."
Karandhara,He's also imperfect.,Prabhupāda," Ah? Well his perfection is proved there is satisfaction. The so-called scientists, philosophers, politicians, they could not bring peace in the world. That is their fools."
Karandhara,We have also not brought peace in the world.,Prabhupāda," No, our all followers are peaceful. We... I'm getting thousands of letters, how much you are benefited."
Devotee; Hṛdayānanda,United Nations gets thousands of letters.; I don't think so.,Prabhupāda," They get letters protest, that ""You, rascal, United Nations, what you are doing for this?"""
Karandhara,"No, they're getting millions of dollars in contributions every year from people that think they're doing...",Prabhupāda," No, that ""in future."" No. That is his philosophy. (devotees laugh)"
Karandhara; Devotee (2); Prabhupāda: ; Devotee; Devotee (2): ; Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana; Devotees,"Our philosophy also. We say we can bring peace in the world, but that's in the future.; No, but they are giving their contributions.; (aside:) No.; Maybe that will help them bring some peace.; But we already have peace.; The United Nations cannot bring peace either.; This is a question of the standard of peace.; (discuss among themselves)",Prabhupāda," Then if you say like that, then United Nations is not better than us, you have to accept. If we cannot give peace, and they are not giving peace, then why they are so big organization?"
Karandhara; Prabhupāda: ; Yaśomatīnandana,"They will say because it is a better organization.; They cannot answer. They simply give, they can give simply words, that's all. ""United,"" they're speaking of unity, only flags are increasing. Daily another flag, another flag, another flag, and the flags will never unite. And still they are advertising ""United Nations.""; When the war starts, United States...",Prabhupāda," Yes, in America, they started, United Nations, but they are going to fight with the Vietnam. United Nations."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Unless one is free from the material concept of life, like ""I'm American,"" ""I'm Indian,"" ""I'm Chinese,"" ""I'm Japanese,"" how can he be peaceful? Because he has got some grudge against somebody else.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana; Devotee,"Whereas as a devotee, he doesn't have any grudge against anybody. Therefore he's peaceful.; He has a grudge against the demons.",Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee; Yaśomatīnandana; Devotee (2),Demons.; That's due to love forKṛṣṇa. That's not a grudge against demons.; A devotee also is merciful to the demons.,Prabhupāda," No, no, we are not envious of the demons. Otherwise there is no need of preaching. We are trying to make the demons perfect. That is our preaching."
Devotee; Prabhupāda: ; SvarūpaDāmodara,Compassionate.; Ah? Yes. Compassion.; We are preaching that the human form of life is the most important form of any living entities.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
SvarūpaDāmodara,That human form of life...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,...is the most important species.,Prabhupāda," Developed consciousness, developed consciousness."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But somebody asks, ""How do I know a bird is not more highly advanced than a human being?""",Prabhupāda, How you can ask?
Devotee (2),By example.,Prabhupāda, That is... Human being has created the city. The bird cannot.
Devotee (2),Birds also create cities.,Prabhupāda," No, their cities, their own way, not like this. Human being has constructed the skyscraper building. A bird cannot. In that sense you are advanced. That sense you are advanced."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So they say this is just our own mental concoction.,Prabhupāda," They can repair their nest with some stick, and that's all. That much they can do. But you can big, big beams, you can... That is the difference."
Yaśomatīnandana,Because even the most powerful birds we can control.,Prabhupāda," But, but there is no benefit. You are misusing your intelligence by skyscraper building, and they're using their intelligence to make a nest; but the benefit derived is equal. Therefore, in that sense you are less intelligence."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"In other words, they never violate the laws of nature, but other..., we are backward, because we tried to fight against the laws of nature.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is our disease.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Devotee (2),So they are more advanced.; Practically you said that.,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2),That the birds are living naturally.,Prabhupāda," Yeah, naturally. No... They have no discrimination. They have to abide by the laws of nature. But you have got discrimination; therefore you are punished."
Devotee (2),So we will attract the scientists by saying that we are both fools?,Prabhupāda, Ah?
Devotee (2); Prabhupāda: ; Devotee (2),"Before we were saying that we were both fools. Is that the way to attract the scientists?; No, no. That was argument. We are not fools; the scientist is fool. (devotees laugh) We are educated.; But how we can get them to come, to takeprasādam?",Prabhupāda," That... Yes, give them niceprasādam, they'll come. If one scientist can be captured, many others can be captured. (laughter)"
Yaśomatīnandana: ; Devotee (2),"By saying that ""We have got free food, come anddinewith us.""; But first we give themprasādamand then they come, or first they come and then we give themprasādam?",Prabhupāda," Yes, just like that Dr. Wolfe came also. So gradually they'll come, because they're..."
SvarūpaDāmodara: ,But they're more interested in seeing the molecules than in takingprasādam.,Prabhupāda, No...
SvarūpaDāmodara: ; Devotee (2),That is their (indistinct).; So we have to trick them to takeprasādam.,Prabhupāda," They will (indistinct) as students not to see molecules, but to see how palatable dishes are there. (laughter)"
Devotee,"Yeah, they will forget it.",Prabhupāda, At that time they forget their laboratory.
Yaśomatīnandana; SvarūpaDāmodara,"You forgot your laboratory.; Just likeGovindaKhorana, he got Nobel Prize about two years ago.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So whenever he works, he never cares about anything, but he carries his only piece of paper and pen so that he can write molecules. So his consciousness is only on molecules, and he is very happy.",Prabhupāda," That is nice. That ismāyā. That ismāyā. Even the pig is happy eating stool. That ismāyā.Āvaraṇātmika-śakti(?). Covering energy ofmāyā. Unless he's covered, he cannot eat and enjoy."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So these are all guided bymāyā.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ[Bg.3.27]. Prakṛtiis conducting everything, as you are associating with qualities ofprakṛti. That I have already explained."
Devotees,Jaya! All glories to... (end),Prabhupāda," ...has done a great mistake. I never expected... (noise) ...all of a sudden... [break] You see the so-called swamis and yogis. They could not do anything, because they are outsider. They are not within the jurisdiction ofKṛṣṇa. One must remain within the jurisdiction ofKṛṣṇa. Then his spiritual life is assured. Otherwise, paramour(?). [break] Similarly, everything, everyone belongs to Kṛṣṇa's family, but we have to see what he's doing forKṛṣṇa. Just like everyone is citizen of the state. Why a man is given high position and big title? Why? Because he's recognized."
Sudāmā,Right.,Prabhupāda," So one must give service. Simply to feel, ""I belong to Kṛṣṇa's family,"" and doing nothing forKṛṣṇa, that is not..."
Sudāmā,That's no good.,Prabhupāda, That's no good. That is not good. That means he'll... Very soon he'll again forgetKṛṣṇa. He'll again forgetKṛṣṇa.
Sudāmā,"Actually, the other element is so powerful. These people here, because, even though they are part of Kṛṣṇa's family, but because they have forgotten, then we become influenced by their forgetfulness.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Forgetfulness meansmāyā.
Sudāmā,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Māyāis nothing. It is a forgetfulness. That's all. It has no existence. Forgetfulness, it does not stand. But so long it is there, it is very troublesome."
Sudāmā,"I've been asked a question by some devotees sometimes that they don't feel happy. So even if they are unhappy, mentally, should, they still should continue inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. I tell them, even if one is unhappy...",Prabhupāda," But you should show example. If you show example different way, how they will follow you?"
Sudāmā,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, Example is better than precept. Why you are living outside?
Sudāmā,"Well, I...",Prabhupāda," [break] ...last time I was so much deteriorated in health, I had to leave this place. That does not mean I'll leave the Society. I went to India and recuperated. Or came to London. That's all right. So health may be sometimes... But that does not mean we shall give up the Society. If my health is unsuitable here, I go... I have a hundred centers. And you'll not go out of this universe for your health recouping. You have to remain within the universe. Then why do you go out of the Society? [break] ...Śrī NarottamadāsaṬhākura. We have to live with devotees. Why I left my family? Because they were not devotees. Therefore I come... Otherwise, in old age, I would have been comfortable. No. We should not live with the nondevotees, may be family men or anyone. Just likeMahārājaVibhīṣaṇa. Because his brother was not devotee, he left him, left him. He came toRāmacandra.Vibhīṣaṇa. You know that?"
Sudāmā; Hṛdayānanda,"Yes.; So Prabhupāda, it says that asannyāsīshould live alone. That means only with devotees.",Prabhupāda, Who...! Where it is saidsannyāsīshould live alone?
Hṛdayānanda,"I mean, sometimes in your books.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,Sometimes in your books. So that means with devotees.,Prabhupāda," In general,sannyāsīmay live alone. Butsannyāsī'sduty is to preach."
Sudāmā,That I don't ever want to stop.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Sudāmā,I don't ever want to stop preaching.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Well, preaching, you cannot manufacture preaching. You must do preaching according to the principles ordered by your spiritual master. You cannot manufacture your own way of preaching. That is required. There must be some leader. Under the leadership.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat...Why it is said? Everywhere, in the office, there is some immediate boss. So you have to please him. That is service. Suppose in office, in a department there is office superintendent. And if you do in your own way, ""Yes, I'm doing my business,"" and the office superintendent is not pleased, do you think that kind of service is nice? No. Similarly, we have got, everywhere we have got immediate boss. So we must work. That is systematic. If everyone manufactures, invents his own way of life, then there must be chaos."
Sudāmā,"Yeah, that's true.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Now we are world organization. There is spiritual side, and there is material side also. That is not material side. That is also spiritual side, means systematic management. Otherwise how it will be done? Just like Gaurasundara sold the house, and there is no trace of the money. What is this? He did not ask him, anyone. He sold the house, and where is the money, there is no trace. [break] Ah,HareKṛṣṇa. What is that badge? Tennis?"
Devotee,It's not a badge. It's the only sweater I...,Prabhupāda," Oh, that's nice. Yesterday I received one letter from RūpānugaMahārāja. He's preaching very nice. Yes."
Hṛdayānanda,Rūpānuga?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,There have been several people here in Los Angeles...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,"...that have wanted to meet you. A councilman, a councilman here in Los Angeles would like to meet you, a city councilman.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Oh, yes. He's welcome."
Umāpati,"So, and, and um, also a Professor Scharfe at the UCLA, he's...",Prabhupāda, Professor?
Umāpati; SvarūpaDāmodara; Umāpati; SvarūpaDāmodara; Devotee; SvarūpaDāmodara; Umāpati,"Professor Scharfe. He's a Sanskrit scholar of the Vedic, Vedic...; Scharfer?; Scharfe. Scharfe.; It's not Scharfer?; Scharfe, spelled S-c-h-a-r-f-e.; Yes, I met him.; Yes. He would like very much to meet with you.",Prabhupāda," All right. Make appointment. What, what is his purpose to meet me?"
Umāpati,"Well, Professor Scharfe is interested in your writings, and I don't know the councilman's motives. He just sent word to me that he would like to meet with you.",Prabhupāda, We welcome any respectable gentleman. We have to go this way?
Karandhara; Hṛdayānanda,"Uh, yeah, Prabhupāda, we can go this way, through here. [break]; The scientists will never give up.",Prabhupāda, They are trying.
Hṛdayānanda; SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are likeJarāsandha. They come back every day on your walk.; Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have any specific reference foracintyain the Vedic reference?",Prabhupāda," Acintya,acintya,yes,acintya.Acintyapotency, even you have gotacintyapotency. That I have already explained. Because we are part and parcel ofKṛṣṇa, therefore there is pinch ofacintya,inconceivable potency, in us also.Harernāmaharernāmaharernāma...[Cc. Ādi17.21]."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Do we have any specific reference?,Prabhupāda," Yes.JīvaGosvāmī.JīvaGosvāmī has stated that unless we acceptacintya,inconceivable energy, there is no conception of God. There is no conception of God. If you bring God to your conception, he's not God."
Umāpati,"Acintya,acintya-bhedais a unique contribution of Vaiṣṇavas to the concept of God.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Actually, that is the fact. We cannot explain what is God. We have to accept what is God from God."
Yaśomatīnandana,Avaroha.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,Avarohaprocess?,Prabhupāda," Yes, notava...Yes,avarohaprocess. Yes, thank you. HereKṛṣṇasays,mattaḥparataraṁnānyat [Bg.7.7].We have to accept that.Mattaḥparataraṁnānyat kiñcidastidhanañjaya[Bg.7.7].So ""There is no more superior authority than Me.""Harernāmaharernāma...[Cc. Ādi17.21]."
Yaśomatīnandana,(loud waves drowns out voice),Prabhupāda," Ah,nameviduḥsura-gaṇāḥ...[Bg10.2]."
Yaśomatīnandana,"What to speak of these teeny scientists, even the great sages can't know Him.",Prabhupāda, Yes.Ahamādirhidevānām...
Yaśomatīnandana,Maharṣīṇāṁcasarvaśaḥ.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Yaśomatīnandana,"Even LordBrahmā, when he saw the innumerableViṣṇuforms of the childKṛṣṇa, then he himself said that ""As far as I know, as far as I am concerned, I don't know anything about You.""",Prabhupāda," No, he... Yes. That is the Brahmā's position, what to speak of others.Yasyāntaṁnaviduḥsurāsura-gaṇādevāyatasmainamaḥ.Yaṁbrahmāvaruṇendra-rudra-marutaḥstunvantidivyaiḥstavaiḥ.Brahmā,Varuṇa, all demigods.Yaṁbrahmāvaruṇendra-rudra.Rudraeven, Śiva, Lord Śiva.Stunvantidivyaiḥstavairvedaiḥsāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadairgāyantiyaṁsāma-gāḥ, dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatenamanasāpaśyantiyaṁyoginaḥ[SB12.13.1].ThatBhāraticited this verse. Yes."
Hṛdayānanda,The five gods?,Prabhupāda," No, no, this verse."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Is that by Śaṅkarācārya, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," No, no. It is Vedic."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Where is it from, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Where is it from?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,It is theBhāgavatam?,Prabhupāda," Yes,Bhāgavatamis there.Yaṁbrahmāvaruṇendra-rudra-marutaḥstunvantidivyaiḥstavairvedaiḥsāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadairgāyantiyaṁsāma-gāḥ."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"I remember Śrīla Prabhupāda used this ""acintya"" to differentiate between the life and the non-living.",Prabhupāda, Acintyameans living.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No,acintya-śakti.Life, life hasacintya...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Whereas non-life doesn't have.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Matter, just like a molecule doesn't have thisacintya.But they may...",Prabhupāda," No, it has, but it is covered too much. Consciousness is covered. Potency, potent. It is potent."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Molecule has consciousness?,Prabhupāda," Yes, everything has consciousness, but it is covered. The degree is of covering."
Umāpati,I was reading the writings of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura inJaivaDharma.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Umāpati,"And he is explaining the word""śraddhā,"" and he defines it in there as the tendency of the mind towards devotion without regard tojñānaorkarma.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana; Umāpati,"Śraddhā.; Śraddhā.And I have heard it variously interpreted as meaning ""faith"" or ""belief,"" which really falls short of that interpretation.",Prabhupāda, What is that interpretation?
Umāpati,Could you elaborate on the definition ofśraddhā?,Prabhupāda," Śraddhāis explained inCaitanya-caritāmṛta.Śraddhāmeans firm conviction. That isśraddhā.Just likeKṛṣṇasays that ""I am the Supermost."" So if you have firm conviction in Kṛṣṇa's words, that isśraddhā."
Umāpati,Yes.,Prabhupāda," If you have doubts, then that is notśraddhā."
Umāpati,So therefore one can understand only if one is inśraddhā.,Prabhupāda," No, thatśraddhāhas to be increased."
Umāpati,How it is increased?,Prabhupāda, The beginning ofśraddhāmeans firm conviction.
Umāpati,"How is itśraddhādoes not exist in one person, and it does exist...",Prabhupāda," No,śraddhāis there. It has to be awakened."
Umāpati,Śraddhāis in every person then.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Therefore I say it is covered. It is covered. That covering has to be taken away. That is calledbhajana(indistinct). That is called culture.
Umāpati,Upāsanā.,Prabhupāda," Upāsanā,bhajana,sādhana,culture, whatever you say. He has to awaken thatśraddhā,more and more."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Prabhupāda, is everyjīvagiven a chance in the beginning to go in the spiritual world? Then he falls down, or...?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,Or sometimes thejīvamay choose directly...,Prabhupāda," Thejīvais atomic. It is smaller than the atoms. One ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair.Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasyaśatāṁśaḥ sādṛśātmakaḥ[Cc.Madhya19.140].So every living entity, atom."
Yaśomatīnandana,Is he first allowed...?,Prabhupāda, Less than the atom. Smaller than the atom.
Yaśomatīnandana,Is he allowed to associate withKṛṣṇain the beginning?,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,"Asjīva,asjīvais...",Prabhupāda," He's always withKṛṣṇa. Simply he has forgotten. Have you not been withKṛṣṇa? We are standing on this sand. The sand isKṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's energy. We are standing by the water. This is Kṛṣṇa's energy.Bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥ[Bg.7.4].Don't you read that? So is it different fromKṛṣṇa?"
Yaśomatīnandana,"No, but it is...",Prabhupāda, My body is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. I am also Kṛṣṇa's energy. I am always withKṛṣṇa. Simply I have forgotten it.
Yaśomatīnandana,"But this is Kṛṣṇa's inferior energy, right?",Prabhupāda," That may be. That is a comparative study, inferior or superior. But it is energy."
Yaśomatīnandana,Yes.,Prabhupāda," As energy, it is not different fromKṛṣṇa, as energy."
Yaśomatīnandana,Vāsudevaḥsarvamiti[Bg.7.19].,Prabhupāda," Yes. As energy, how can you differentiate fromKṛṣṇa?"
Umāpati,You give the... It could be described as like the growth of a plant as compared to the energy of the sun.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,The growth of a plant as compared to the energy of the sun.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,"The growth of the plant is the inferior energy, and the... (loud waves)",Prabhupāda," Yes, there are so many things. That is comparative study. But... (loud waves) Energy is not different from the energetic. Sunshine is not different from the sun.Idaṁhiviśvaṁbhagavānivetaraḥ.Everything isBhagavān, but it appears like different."
Yaśomatīnandana,Is that what it means bysarvaṁkhalvidaṁbrahma?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,"Everything is spiritual, but when it is... due to our ignorance, we think it is material.",Prabhupāda," Yes, but don't associate with... (indistinct) ...must realize."
Yaśomatīnandana,So Māyāvādīs artificially think that?,Prabhupāda, Yes. They have no realization.
Yaśomatīnandana,"Somebody even asked me about what is material and what is spiritual, Prabhupāda. I said that whatever is in connection with God is spiritual and whatever is not in connection with God is material. Is that right?",Prabhupāda," That's nice, that's nice."
Karandhara,The consciousness makes a difference.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,Your consciousness makes the difference.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,Because everything is in connection with God except for our own consciousness when we're inmāyā.,Prabhupāda, Just like we are takingprasādam.How it is spiritual?
Yaśomatīnandana,It is offered toKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,"By our knowledge, that it is...",Prabhupāda," By knowledge... Because it is offered toKṛṣṇa. TheKṛṣṇaconsciousness is there. So anything which is accepted inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is spiritual thing."
Umāpati,"In perfect knowledge, would the first step be faith that it is offered toKṛṣṇa? One may, may make an offering without being...",Prabhupāda," Well, he must learn under superior direction. Otherwise, how he can offer?"
Umāpati,"Well, he may make an attempt. There is a natural impulse to serve, a natural impulse to offer in man, and he may not be aware that he is seekingKṛṣṇain his conditioned state. Then, if...",Prabhupāda, Then whom he's offering? If he doesn't knowKṛṣṇa...
Umāpati,That is his ignorance. If he is seeking.,Prabhupāda," Then, if he's in ignorance, what is the value of his offering?"
Umāpati; Hṛdayānanda; Umāpati; Hṛdayānanda; Umāpati,"I did not hear the last point.; If he's in ignorance, what is the value of the offering?; That is true.; He needs a spiritual master.; Yes.",Prabhupāda, You cannot do anything in ignorance.
Umāpati,But then the spiritual master gives him knowledge...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,...and then from that knowledge he becomes aware that...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,...Kṛṣṇais in the offering.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana,"Jaya.; Spiritual master gives knowledge, and then a disciple is eternally indebted to spiritual master.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Yaśomatīnandana,"It is not that, like Māyāvādīs, they serve the spiritual master in the beginning and then they...",Prabhupāda, Then they...
Yaśomatīnandana,...themselves become...,Prabhupāda," ...throw him away, ""Go away. I have now learned.""Guru-mara-vidyā,to, the knowledge of how to killguru.Guru-mara-vidyā.Their, the philosophy is that you cannot rise up. You take a ladder. But as soon as you rise, throw away the ladder. No more. No more needed. That isMāyāvādaphilosophy. Our philosophy isdhyāyanstuvaṁstasyayaśastri-sandhyam."
Yaśomatīnandana,Three...,Prabhupāda, Eternally.
Yaśomatīnandana,"Somebody told me, Prabhupāda, aboutVallabhācārya, that he sometimes, he once went to LordCaitanyaand said that he wrote a better commentary than a previousācārya,and Lord...",Prabhupāda, Yes. ŚrīdharaSvāmī.
Yaśomatīnandana,LordCaitanyachastised him?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,An unchaste wife who abandons a swami.,Prabhupāda," He referred to ŚrīdharaSvāmī. So swami means husband. So He sarcastically remarked, ""Anyone who does not accept swami, she is prostitute."""
Yaśomatīnandana,"IsVallabhācārya, Prabhupāda, in accordance with our philosophy?",Prabhupāda," Yes, he'sVaiṣṇava,ācārya.But that very deviation, that ""I have done something better than Śrīdhara,"" that is not ourparamparāsystem. Then he was thinking himself better than Śrīdhara. That is not allowed. We should always remain servant of the servant [Cc.Madhya13.80]. Never we shall think that ""I am better than myGuruMahārāja."" That is fall down.HareKṛṣṇaHare... Our Juhu Beach is very nice."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Yes, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," All clean, and you can walk very nicely. In Bombay."
Yaśomatīnandana,And lot of people can see you. And they bow down to you?,Prabhupāda," If they do not, what can I do?"
Yaśomatīnandana,"Well, no, if they do, then they will go toVaikuṇṭha. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," That is our śāstric injunction, that as soon as you see asannyāsī,you must bow down. Otherwise, you should fast one day. It doesn't matter, I or you. This is the injunction of theśāstra,thatsannyāsīis supposed to be theguruof the society. So one must bow down."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Prabhupāda, in our movement there are so manysannyāsīs.If we see thesannyāsī,same, so many times in one day, we should bow down every time we see him?",Prabhupāda," If you can, of course."
Śrutakīrti,It wouldn't hurt.,Prabhupāda, Yes. [break] ...this time He used to take Hissaṅkīrtanaparty for strolling all over the city.
Hṛdayānanda,"Prabhupāda, we are helpless without you.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Hṛdayānanda,We are helpless without you.,Prabhupāda, Hm. Yes. Today sky is clear.
Umāpati,"With this energy crisis now, it'll be even clearer.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,"With this energy crisis it'll be even more clear. [break] ...these people, these politicians, this power that we have in our government would be..., come to an end.",Prabhupāda," It has already come to an end. There is no government anywhere, simply chaos."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Prabhupāda, do you think that the ISKCON will, thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness will become a major religion in any country?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness will become a major religion in any country?,Prabhupāda," So far the statement goes,manuṣyāṇāṁsahasreṣu[Bg.7.3],one can understand. But even one person understands, it is beneficial for many. Yes."
Yaśomatīnandana,"Just like you understood yourGuruMahārāja's message, and the whole world is benefited.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda; Yaśomatīnandana,"Jaya,Śrīla Prabhupāda.; Not everybody can be that potent. [break]",Prabhupāda," ...just like the sunshine is open to everyone, but if you do not take advantage of it, that is your fault. Sunshine is not meant for, specifically for any person. It is open to everyone. But if you purposefully close your door, and do not see the sunshine, that is your fault."
Yaśomatīnandana; Umāpati,"Yes, Prabhupāda, but there's only one earthly planet, and you have conquered it already.; Is not a trueVaiṣṇavaalso asannyāsī?Would you explain the difference between them?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,"Is not a, one who is truly aVaiṣṇava, is he not also asannyāsīby his...?",Prabhupāda," Sannyāsī,sannyāsīis in the material platform, andVaiṣṇavais in the spiritual platform."
Umāpati,So then theVaiṣṇavais superior to asannyāsī?,Prabhupāda, Yes. He's notsannyāsī.He's abovesannyāsī.
Umāpati,Oh. But aVaiṣṇavawould always offer his respects to asannyāsī.Is that not true?,Prabhupāda," Yes,Kṛṣṇawas offering respect to His elderly persons. That is etiquette."
Karandhara; Umāpati,"Step aside a little bit so that Prabhupāda can... If you stay to the side a little bit, you box Prabhupāda in.; There's some austerity, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Yes. What is that?
Umāpati,They're sleeping on the beach.,Prabhupāda, So what is the benefit of their sleeping? (laughter)
Umāpati,They save their rent money.,Prabhupāda, Eh? That is his misfortune. That is a young man's fashion in your country.
Umāpati,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is not austerity. That is licentiousness.
Umāpati,"Yes. It comes from a time when we admire swashbuckling and being free, so-called, in the material sense.",Prabhupāda," That is reaction. The rich man is trying to become a poor man. ""Let me see what is the advantage of the poor man."" That's right. Your country does not require to lie down like that. You have got enough arrangement. But it is a fashion. That's all. So fashion is not austerity. That is sense gratification. It appears like austerity, but it is sense gratification. Real austerity is not to make any sense gratification, simply to serveKṛṣṇa. That is real austerity."
Umāpati,"So ifKṛṣṇarequired us to sleep on the beach, then...",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,"...that would not be... ifKṛṣṇarequired us to sleep on the beach, that would not be sense gratification.",Prabhupāda, No. And whyKṛṣṇawill require like that? Do you mean to sayKṛṣṇais a madman?
Umāpati; Yaśomatīnandana,"No.; Yes, I was thinking that too. Why wouldKṛṣṇarequire any of his devotees to sleep on the beach?",Prabhupāda," He wants to see His devotees are comfortably situated. Why He'll unnecessarily ask that ""Go to the beach and lie down?"""
Umāpati,"You say thatKṛṣṇastands there smiling very sweetly, playing the flute.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,So why should he require us to go through austerities like...?,Prabhupāda, Yes.Ācāryameans he must show by example.Āpaniācaribhaktiśikhāimusabāre.HareKṛṣṇa...
Umāpati,Is there such a thing as a sincere atheist...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Umāpati,...who benefits by austerity?,Prabhupāda, Atheist? Atheist? How he's sincere?
Umāpati,That's what I... That's what I'm asking.,Prabhupāda," Honest thief? It is contradictory. If I say, ""Here is an honest thief,"" is that a good designation, honest thief?"
Umāpati,"Well, in that case, that's so. You're right. It's absurd. Yes.",Prabhupāda, So...
Yaśomatīnandana; Umāpati,"A sincere atheist...; But there are those who appear... At least, they think, they feel they are sincere when they go through austerities, but they won't acceptKṛṣṇaconsciousness as, at this point in their, in their existence.",Prabhupāda," No, some atheists say that ""We are Godless because nobody has convinced us about the existence of God."" That is honesty. That is honesty. But there are rascals, however you may convince him, he'll not take it. That is rascaldom."
Yaśomatīnandana,Believe in God.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,So the honest ones become devotees?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Hṛdayānanda,We were all...,Prabhupāda," If he's honest, then he must take."
Yaśomatīnandana,"We were all atheists, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Yaśomatīnandana,We were all atheists.,Prabhupāda," Yes. If you, if, if, if an atheist is honest, then when he's convinced, he must acceptKṛṣṇa. That is honesty. If after convincing him, he does not take, that is dishonesty."
Umāpati,Yes.,Prabhupāda, This is dishonesty.
Umāpati,"But there's a quality in this age that one does not accept defeat philosophically, philosophical defeat. If one is presented with philosophically sound arguments, it is a tendency today to refuse to accept the superiority ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness philosophy over any other philosophy.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,"It's very popular to put all philosophies in the same... ""Well, that's philosophy,"" they say. They say that ""Everybody has his opinion. That's your opinion,"" they say.",Prabhupāda, No.
Umāpati,So no one will accept any kind of superior philosophy. It's very difficult to discuss these things among them.,Prabhupāda," No, then everyone, if becomes superior, then where is the question of philosophy? If everyone is superior himself, then there is no question of philosophy. Is there any necessity? You are superior, I am superior; then where is the question of discussing philosophy?"
Umāpati,That is trying to be God. He's trying... Then we are always God.,Prabhupāda," Then philosophy becomes null and void. As soon as everyone becomes his own authority, then philosophy becomes null and void. There is no necessity of philosophy."
Umāpati,That is the difficulty of our age.,Prabhupāda," That means they are rascals.Mūḍhāḥ.If you do not accept philosophy, you do not accept authority, that means all rascals."
Hṛdayānanda,"You said,""alpa-medhasaḥ...""",Prabhupāda," Outlaws, they are called outlaws. Just the outlaws, they do not accept any authority, government authority, or authority of the law, they're called outlaws. Rejected."
Umāpati,"Yeah, well, this is a nation of outlaws.",Prabhupāda," So they are rejected. If anyone, everyone becomes his own authority, then it is chaos."
Umāpati,"Well, that is the fashion today.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Fashion means...
Umāpati,"It's called ""Do your own thing.""",Prabhupāda," No, who are you to say me, ""Do your own thing""? Then you become master. You are directing me. Why should you direct me, ""Do your own thing""? You stop. Don't talk. If your philosophy accepted that everyone is authority, you cannot say, ""Do your own work."" Why should you say? Then you become authority. You should not speak at all."
Karandhara,That is also a philosophy.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Karandhara,That is also a philosophy.,Prabhupāda, What is that philosophy?
