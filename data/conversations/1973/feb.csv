Devotee,...māmevaiṣyasi yuktvaivamātmānaṁmat-parāyanaḥ.,Prabhupāda, (indistinct)
Devotee,Again?,Prabhupāda," Yes, go on, read the purport."
Devotee,"""Translation: Engage your mind always in thinking of Me. Offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you'll come to Me.""",Prabhupāda," So this is the process. Says, ""Always think of Me."" (speaks Hindi to guest for some minutes) This is the translation. Read the purport. Purport."
Devotee,"""Purport: In this verse it is clearly indicated thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's mind andKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais not an ordinary human being. He's Absolute Truth. His body...""",Prabhupāda," Just like Dr. Radhakrishnan. He has explained this verse... WhenKṛṣṇasaysman-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,he comments, ""It is not to the personKṛṣṇa."" Just see.Kṛṣṇasaysman-manā,""Always think of Me."" And he, out of his so-called nonsense scholarship, he says, ""It is not toKṛṣṇa."" (Hindi)"
Guest (1) Indian man,He's impersonalist. I read thatBhagavad-gītāin school.,Prabhupāda, He's a nonsense. He's a nonsense. Now he's suffering. I saw him last year in Madras. He has lost his brain. He's suffering now. You cannot ask him whether he's hungry or whether he wants some... Only his daughter is attending and here he cannot understand who is standing before him. He cannot speak. Like that. (Hindi) He has committed so much offenses under the lotus feet ofKṛṣṇa. (Hindi for some minutes) ...very meritorious. I think you cannot understand Hindi.
Devotee,He speaks English.,Prabhupāda," Ah. So you can understand English then. So (Sanskrit).Duṣkṛtinaḥmeans...kṛtiḥmeans meritorious, very meritorious. Butduṣkṛtiḥ.Whatever merit he has got... Nowadays at the present moment the civilization is somadthat everyone as human being... Any human being he has got some merit because he is not cat and dog. He's a man. As a man he has got brain, better than the cats and dogs. That's a fact. And actually they're doing so many things. Just like this picture. It is a very meritorious workmanship. So everyone can do some meritorious workmanship. But when that workmanship is diverted to, for the use of sinful activities... Just like one man is very meritorious, he's planning to form a party how to plunder. This requires merit. Without merit you cannot form a party. But the merit is being used for plundering, for harassing, for so many other sinful activities. So that is calledduṣkṛtinaḥ.Merit is there but the merit is being misused for sinful activities. Thereforeduṣkṛtiḥ.Just like modern scientist. It is meritorious that they have discovered the atomic bomb. The merit is used for killing. If you just use your merit so that man may live; that they're dying. Everyone is dying. So you have discovered a bomb which will accelerate death. Death, everyone is going to die. So if you manufacture something which will actually help my death, is that very meritorious? If you discover something that will stop my death, that is meritorious. But everyone is dying and you have discovered some machine so that you can die quickly. What is the merit? But people are appreciating, ""Oh, this is meritorious."" This is calledduṣkṛtiḥ. Duṣkṛtiḥ,mean one has got merit, it is being spoiled for doing something wrong. This is calledduṣkṛtiḥ.So such people,duṣkṛtinaḥ,who, one who is using the merit for sinful activities, he cannot understandKṛṣṇa. He cannot surrender toKṛṣṇa.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ[Bg.7.15] and rascal. Rascal means denying the existence of God. He's a rascal. Anyone who denies the existence of God, he's a rascal. Rascal means poor fund of knowledge. Everything... Suppose this is a country, Indonesia, nicely being managed; the roads are there; the policemen there, they're directing... Just yesterday we were trying to enter in a one way, policeman directs. So this symptom says that there is a good government. So any sane man, he'll see the cosmic manifestation—that the sun is rising exactly in time; the moon is rising exactly in time; the seasons are changing; the seas is in its position. Just like the Pacific Ocean at any moment it can overflow at any place. But it does not do so. You walk... I was walking in Los Angeles just about three feet away from the sea. So I was explaining to my students, ""Now, I am just three feet away from the sea and the sea is so vast. At any second it can overflood us. But why you are confident the sea will not come here?"" Because we know, by God's order, although the sea, the ocean, is so big, it cannot violate the order of God. That you are big, that's all right. But you cannot come beyond this line. So these things are being managed. And there is no God? What a nonsense. If things are... Just like when you pass through a house, sometimes if you don't see—the house is not properly taken care of, or there is no light in front of the house, there are so many garbages, we immediately say, ""Oh, there is no man in this house."" And as soon as you see house is very nicely kept, there is light and the garden is kept, we understand there is a man. So this is common sense. If things are going on, everything is going on so nicely, how you can say there is no management, there is no brain? How you can say? What is this nonsense? How you can say there is no God?Asatyamapratiṣṭhaṁtejagad āhuranīśvaram[Bg.16.8].These are the rascal, atheist proposition,asatyam.There is no proof in it. Zero. From zero it has come. Just see nonsense. Does anything come out of zero? You assemble zero, many millions of zero in one place, but still it is zero. Do you think that if you make zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, million times, has it any value? How do they conclude from zero such a management, cosmic manifestation has come? The flower is coming out nicely in its own way. The tree is coming. Human being is coming. Everything is in order. And there is no management. How much rascaldom. Just see. So these atheist class, they're rascals,mūḍhāḥ,third-class men without any knowledge.Namāṁduṣkṛtinaḥ.I've already explained. Using the merit for sinful activities, they're calledduṣkṛtiḥ.Andmūḍhāḥ,these rascals, who cannot understand how the management is going on,mūḍhāḥ.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥ,prapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].Narādhamāḥmeans...Narameans human being.Adhamameans the lowest, because the lowest of the mankind. The highest of the mankind means who has the knowledge of the Supreme. He's called highest,brāhmaṇa.Brahma-jānāti,one who knowsBrahman. He's called highest. And the lowest means that he has got this body, human form of body, but he is acting like animal. Just like cats and dogs, they cannot understand what is God. So any person who is not understanding, or trying to understand what is God, he's the lowest of the mankind. Because in the human form of life, it is the chance to understand what is God, but he's misusing it. He's using this body just like cats and dogs. They eat, sleep, have sex intercourse, and die. So these things are there. But if somebody argues that you are saying lowest of the mankind but we see so many Dr. Radhakrishnans, they also do not admit. Therefore the word is used,māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.They appear to be very highly learned scholars but their real knowledge has been taken bymāyā. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ. Āsuri-bhāva.Why he can remain so? Becauseāsuri-bhāva,there is no God. That is their determination. There is no God. Therefore their merit is being misused, they have become the lowest of the mankind. They have become the Fool No. 1 and all that so-called education, academics, knowledge has been taken away bymāyā.This is... So we test only whether he's a devotee of God. If he's not a devotee of God then we take either of these: he must be the rascal, or lowest of the mankind, or simply using the merit for sinful activities, or his knowledge has been taken away bymāyā.Immediately, we have no difficulty to understand what class of man he is. The test is whether he has got any sense of understanding God. If not then he comes to this group. It is not very difficult to study man, what he is. We have got the formula in theBhagavad-gītā.(Hindi)"
Devotee,"Your explanation you've just given was so clear, Prabhupāda. We can easily see. It's so clear.",Prabhupāda," (chuckling) Yes, this is the explanation. There is no second explanation.Namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].This is the only explanation. What explanation can you... Who can give another explanation? There is no second explanation.Bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasyajātiḥśāstraṁjapastapaḥ, aprāṇasyevadehasyamaṇḍanaṁloka-rañjanam.It's like if you decorate the dead body. It may be pleasing to some relatives of the dead body, otherwise what is the value of it? Others will think, ""What a foolish man, he is, that decorating the dea..."" Suppose if there is dead body and you're decorating (indistinct) flower. That may be your sentiment because the dead body belongs to your father or mother, like that. It is pleasing to you, but actually what is the value? So similarly, this human civilization is meant for understanding God. If that sense is lacking then it is simply decoration of the dead body. That's all. There is no value."
Guest (1) Indian man,This gentleman doesn't understand English.,Prabhupāda, (Hindi) [break]
Guest (1),"He's nice devotee of Lord ŚrīKṛṣṇa. I remember many years ago, I met him in Surbaya. He used to preach onŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,but in Sindi language.",Prabhupāda, Very good.
Guest (2) Indian man,Of course we do not have good translation in Sindi language as your translation.,Prabhupāda, (Hindi)
Guest (1),He's nice devotee. (Hindi) nice dedication (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, Ācchā.
Guest (1),(Hindi),Prabhupāda," So we have explained in theBhagavad-gītāeverything very nicely. (Hindi conversation for some minutes) ...the Eighteenth Chapter you'll find out, 65, 67 (indistinct). Find out."
Devotee,"Eighteenth Chapter, 65 through 67.",Prabhupāda," Don't find? (indistinct). Yes, here is it. [break]"
Devotee,"Yaidaṁparamaṁguhyaṁmad-bhakteṣvabhidhāsyati,bhaktiṁmayiparāṁkṛtvāmāmevaiṣyatyasaṁśayaḥ[Bg18.68].""Translation: For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.""",Prabhupāda," ""Anyone who explains this devotional service, as explained in theBhagavad-gītā,is guaranteed to come back to Me."" That means the preacher of thisBhagavad-gītāis guaranteed to go back to home, back to Godhead. What is the purport?"
Devotee,"Nacatasmānmanuṣyeṣukaścin mepriya-kṛttamaḥ,bhavitānacame tasmādanyaḥpriyatarobhuvi[Bg.18.69].""There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he. Nor will there ever be one more dear.""",Prabhupāda, Those who are preachers.

(Hindi) This is the real (Hindi) This is the real (Hindi) Your brother-in-law did not come? Eh? (Hindi conversation for some minutes) (end)"
Devotee; Guest (1),Philosophy of life.; What do you mean?,Prabhupāda," Philosophy means why you are working, why you are living, what is the purpose."
Guest (1),"We are working for (indistinct), I have been working also. We just follow the same tradition.",Prabhupāda," Still there must some why. Why your forefathers they work and they die? So do you think that is the only philosophy, to work and die? That is being done by the animals also. They work and die."
Guest (1),(indistinct),Prabhupāda," That is another thing. First thing is, why you are working? What is the purpose of working? If the purpose of working is to work hard and then die, finished, then where is the difference between the animals and the men? They are also working. They are dying, too. Cats, dogs, hogs. Then after some time they die without knowing the purpose of life. Then where is the difference between cats, dogs, hogs and (indistinct) human beings. This question does not arise in the modern civilization. And one is thinking, ""Yes, it is the same."" But they're lying on the street, we're lying on a very nice apartment, bedstead. This is our profit."
Devotee,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, it will take about a half hour to get the puffed rice.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Then you give me, little fruit or..."
Devotee,Fruits?,Prabhupāda, You have got that sliced? Bread sliced? No.
Devotee,"Slices of bread, I have them here.",Prabhupāda, The last one.
Devotee; Guest (1),The one we made last was a good one.; What bread is that?,Prabhupāda, (Hindi) In Bombay it is very... Somebody told me that he made at his home. They do it at home.
Devotee,I think it's called rice.,Prabhupāda," Rice, yes. In Bengali we callmuḍi.It is very popular, staple food for ordinary, everyone. In Bengal village, it is very popular because they're rice eaters. From rice they make this puffed rice. So they taking it in the morning. Puffed rice, mixed with molasses and cheese. It makes very good combination. Similarly... Puffed rice must be there, and fruits, like mango, banana, little molasses, and cheese mixed together. It is very nice. (indistinct) This jackfruit... Puffed rice is the vehicle for eating all this. Or if these things are not available, then mix with ghee, little and salt, pepper and, what is called? Cucumber."

Guest (1),Kumula.,Prabhupāda, You are in a different world.
Guest (1),Yes. Is it Bengali food though? In Bombay also?,Prabhupāda," Yes. This puffed rice is used all provinces, all provinces, especially in Bombay and Bengal. I think everywhere, in Madras, U.P. In U.P. it is calledbajiya, chavalchanabajiya."
Guest (1),Channawe have.,Prabhupāda," No.Channa.That is calledchaval.Puffed rice meanschaval.From grains we have got varieties of foods. Grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, you can make at least four hundred, five hundred varieties."

Guest (1),It's cooked food.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Rice, puffed, fused. Not fused, puffed. No, it is not boiled."
Guest (1),We get it...,Prabhupāda, It's a rough quality rice. It is not made from fine quality rice.
Guest (1),Unpolished.,Prabhupāda," Unpolished, rough quality rice. It is washed nicely, then mixed with little salt, then it is fried, then it is... They know the temper, fried, then they get it out. In Bengal they make. My mother used to do it. Then on sand bath, hot sand you put this prepared hot rice and puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, it becomes puffed. And then you take it out. And then mesh it, to get out of the sand. Then you cook it. It is cooked in sand bath, hot sand. All thisbujiya, bujiya,grains. In India there is professional maker. You... They have got hot sand always ready. You take some grains, and then you put in the hot sand and put, put, put, put, put, put, then they mesh it, return it (indistinct)."

Guest (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Takepapad.Not now, at lunchtime. (Hindi) So you can come at night?"
Devotee; Devotee; Guest (1); Devotee,(offers obeisances to Śrīla Prabhupāda) [break]; Very soon the man from department of religion will be coming.; Minister of religion.; Yes.,Prabhupāda, Shall we go there so that we can sit comfortably.
Devotee,Well there're the same amount of chairs whether we're here or there.,Prabhupāda," No, there are no more chairs. (indistinct)"
Devotee,"Yes, I guess that's best.",Prabhupāda," People are coming, so will you kindly take the trouble to, inside sitting?"
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes, thank you very much. (to guest:) You don't take charge of that."
Devotee,"We will take that. [break] Yes. This is Mr. Ivy Mastram and he is in charge of theHinduand Buddhist Department of the Department of Religion. And this is his next-in-command, director-general, Mr. G.Puja. He was educated in India also.",Prabhupāda," Oh, really. Which city?"
Guest (2),Benares (indistinct) University.,Prabhupāda," Oh, Benares University."
Devotee,"Actually, they have arranged by giving a letter, that we can stay in the country. They simply say, ""We do not object,"" and then the immigration gives us a goodvisa. They especially like your books.",Prabhupāda," Oh, thank you. You have read some of my books?"
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda," They are not my books. I am simply translating. They are written by Vyāsadeva, the original Vedic scholar. So there are now many secular states. Our Vedic idea of secular state is the government must be responsible of proper execution of religious system. It doesn't matter whether one isHinduor one is Christian, one is Mohammedan or Buddhist. It doesn't matter. But it is a government duty to see that one who is professing asHinduwhether he's executing theHinduprinciples of religion properly. That is government. Just like government gives license to so many businesses. One man is selling liquor, wine, government issues license. So the government inspector, excise inspector, goes and sees that the man is doing business according to the license. Government should not be callous that ""You may go on with your so-called religion, we don't care for it."" No. That is not government. Government's duty is to see, just like for example, Christians, their commandment, first commandment is, ""Thou shalt not kill."" It is the government's duty to see that anyone who is professing Christian, ""Why he's killing?"" Immediately he should be punished that ""You are professing as Christian and you are killing."" This is government. Similarly, Buddhist religion also,ahiṁsā.Ahiṁsāparamaṁbuddhiḥ.The government duty should see. And the ultimate test of first-class religion is: the follower has developed love of God. If he does not know anything about God, or if he has not developed love of God, then he has simply wasted time. It may be any religion. That is ultimate test because religion means, it has got relationship with God. Otherwise what is the meaning of religion? Any religion, it doesn't matter. The process should be quest of God. What is God? What is Absolute Truth? Wherefrom everything has come? What is we... what we are? What is our relationship with God? This science. Religion means this science. In theVedānta-sūtra,it is said,athātobrahmajijñāsā.This human life is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth. Otherwise, what is the difference between cats and dogs and human beings? If simply eating, sleeping, and sex life, and defend is the business of human life, then these things are there in the animal life also. They also eat. They also sleep. They have also sex life, and they also defend according to their capacity. We defend with atomic bomb and they defend their own nails and claws. The different spirit is there. So that is not the aim of human life. The aim of human life—this opportunity's given by nature to have a human form of life—is to understand God. Nobody can deny—unless he is a crazy fellow—the existence of God. That is not possible. There must be. I may know it or not know it, it doesn't matter. Therefore religion means to understand God and to awaken your dormant love for God. This is religion. Now there may be difference of process, according to country, time, people. Therefore, it is the duty of the government, it is the duty of the government...HareKṛṣṇa(someone enters). Formerly the kings, they were regularly supervising that their citizens were properly executing religious culture. That was government's duty.Cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13].So now government is callous about religion. I'm very glad to know that your government has left some department to supervise. What is your function in this department?"
Guest 2; Devotee,"Excuse me, my English is very poor. I would like Mr.Kuntito translate, Indonesian. (Indonesian); He would like to have him translate English to Indonesian.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),"He is the director of the (indistinct) ofHinduand Buddhist religion, from Department of Religious Affairs. His duty is to maintain and look after the development of (indistinct) expecting that all people of Indonesia that has to follow any kind of religions (indistinct) Christians, because we have also in charge for the Christianity, we have also in charge for the Muslim, or Islam, and we have also in charge for the Catholic and we have also in charge for other...",Prabhupāda, Very good idea. This is very nice.
Guest (2),"So because we have so many in the prosecuting of their religions, there might be, the people between many religions (indistinct). So the government have to lead the people how (indistinct), to supply also, in the (indistinct) of their materials for readings, and facilities for their, prosecuting their religions. This is the actual (indistinct) department.",Prabhupāda, So this is the idea which I was explaining that...
Guest (2),"(Indonesian) As a matter of fact, also that we are looking from theHinduand Buddhist religions' point of view, how to get (indistinct) this department, especially because we are feeling of lacking of materials because no of our books actually here, written in ancient Indonesian language, which are translated from Sanskrit (indistinct)",Prabhupāda, Ancient English...?
Guest (2),Ancient Indonesian language.,Prabhupāda, Ācchā.
Guest (2),"And now actually, most of the Sanskrit texts also, are not available anymore. Of course we have some few can be available from (indistinct) and that is why actually, to develop this new religions, as well as the Buddhist religion, which have a lack of material for reading. Now the government also tried to rewrite into Indonesianbhāṣā,and as one of the aspects, for example, thatBhagavad-gītāhas been translated into Indonesian.",Prabhupāda, Mmmm.
Guest (2),"Which we are expecting that thisBhagavad-gītāshould be read by English (indistinct) and also, matter of fact, most of English readers can understand and they have the ideas of theMahābhārata,andRāmāyaṇa,and the essence of theBhagavad-gītā.Now the problems, at least the department has (indistinct) facing difficulties to supply materials that are actually needed by the people, is we are lacking of materials. So how, actually we have to solve this problem actually. We are actually, from the government point of view always looking and how we can try to get international relationships between various countries to solve the problems. As the same case also how to educate Indonesian peoples to study more about the Hinduism in order they can teach the Hinduism because in our country religious instruction is compulsory in our, any institution. So we felt, actually in our lack of material as well as lack of institution to develop thisHindureligions. And I, from our government actually, we are expected your visit here that it will be beneficial, both for our side, from the government point of view, and as well as for here and as well in your country.",Prabhupāda, So I think your problems can be solved if you kindly cooperate with us.
Guest (2),Yes. That's why we are looking for... because...,Prabhupāda, We can give you correct idea of religious principles as well as our philosophy.
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda," Religious idea without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion is mental speculation. They should be combined. Religious idea supported by philosophy. Then it is correct. And philosophy without religious idea is simply mental speculation. They should be combined. That combination of religious idea and philosophy, you'll find in theBhagavad-gītā,provided you acceptBhagavad-gītāas it is. If you interpretBhagavad-gītāin your own way, then you'll miss the point. Just like in our country, in India,Bhagavad-gītāhas been interpreted in so different ways that people are now bewildered. They do not know what is actuallyBhagavad-gītā.Take, for example... Just like in the beginning of theBhagavad-gītā,it is said,dharmakṣetrekurukṣetresamavetāyuyutsavaḥ [Bg.1.1].I think you know Sanskrit.Samavetāyuyutsavaḥmāmakāḥpāṇḍavāś caivakimakurvatasañjaya[Bg.1.1].Even a great leader, political leader, he has interpretedkurukṣetraas this body. So where is the dictionary wherekurukṣetrameans this body? But because he's a big political leader thatgītāis going on.Kurukṣetrameans this body.Pāṇḍavameans the five senses. In this way [break] ...they cannot (indistinct) I may tell you frankly. Just likeMahatmaGandhi, he wanted to prove nonviolence fromBhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītāis spoken in the battlefield, and how he can prove nonviolence fromBhagavad-gītā?Then he has to drag some interpretation out of his own way. But because he's a big leader the people are misled. Similarly, all... at present moment in India theBhagavad-gītāhas becoming a plaything that anyone can interpret in his own way and do all nonsense. But I'll request you, because you are so much interested, and you have already approvedBhagavad-gītā,you have translated. Amongst the leading personalities, you try to understandBhagavad-gītāas it is and spread it, it will have immediate effect. That is already experimented. Just like in western countries, before me, hundreds and thousands, swamis and yogis went there. But not a single person could understand what isBhagavad-gītā,and what isKṛṣṇa. Now hundreds and thousands of these boys in Europe, America, Canada, Africa, everywhere, Australia, everywhere, they are now become devotees... So they're intelligent persons, they're coming from rich family. Why they have taken seriously? Because they have understoodBhagavad-gītānicely. So I request that God is neither Indonesian, neither Indian, neither African, God is God. And He claims that all living entities, in any form... The form is superficial. The form is taken as dress. Just like you are dressed in a different way, I am dressed in a different way. But we are not talking to the dress, we are talking to the man who is putting on the dress. Similarly, this bodily distinction is material. But spiritually we are all one. There is no question of becoming Indian or Indonesian or African or Asian or this or that. And that is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.You know.Paṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ.Vidyā-vinaya-sampannebrāhmaṇegavihastiniśunicaivaśvapākecapaṇḍitāḥsama-darśinaḥ[Bg.5.18].Becausepaṇḍitadoes not see the outward dress,paṇḍitasees the inside, who is putting on the dress. Therefore, without misinterpretingBhagavad-gītā,or being misled by so-called big, big leaders, if you try to understandBhagavad-gītāas it is, it will be very nice, beneficial to everyone. That is my, not opinion, but is the fact. Things should be taken as it is. Call a spade a spade. Now, interpretation is required when things are not clear. When things are not very clear, not easily understood... There is example in Sanskrit grammar,gaṅgāyāṁghoṣabali(?). The neighborhood ofghoṣafamily is on the Ganges. Now, on the Ganges-Ganges is water—how there can be a village? Now, here interpretation required. When the matter is [break] ...on the water but on the bank of the Ganges. So when the meaning is not clear, then you can interpret. But when the meaning is clear... Just likeBhagavad-gītā: dharmakṣetrekurukṣetresamavetāyuyutsavaḥ [Bg.1.1].NowKurukṣetrais still there, in..., about 90 miles away from Delhi. Perhaps you have been there. The station is there,Kurukṣetra. Now how one can interpret thatkurukṣetrameans this body? This is going on. In spite of clear understanding, they interpret in their own way so that they have got their own philosophy, they want to support. This is going on. So if you kindly avoid this misleading interpretation, and if you takeBhagavad-gītāas it is, then you get the science of God, science of religion, which is applicable either to Indonesian or Indian or African or American, everyone. The science is appreciated everywhere. Two plus two equal to four, this mathematical science is applicable everywhere. It doesn't matter whether one is a Christian orHinduor Muslim. Similarly,Bhagavad-gītāis the science of religion, science of God. So if you take this book seriously, and try to spread this knowledge among your countrymen, I think you'll be very much benefited. And it can be... We are preaching that. We are the, ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement, is meant for one God, one scripture, onemantra,like that, for all people of the world. And we are happy that people are accepting it in that way, very nicely. And it is very easy. It is very easy. So Mr. Director he has readBhagavad-gītā?"
Guest (2),Yes. He has read it.,Prabhupāda, Very good.
Guest (2),"And I think many Indonesian people, actually have read thisBhagavad-gītābecause we have translated thatBhagavad-gītāin 1966.",Prabhupāda," I see. Very nice. So have you read our, thisBhagavad-gītāAs It Is?"
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, You like it?
Guest (2); Prabhupāda;; Guest (2),(indistinct) because when I was in India (indistinct).; So religion must be there. Without religion the human society is animal society. There must be religion. And religion means to know God. That is religion. What is your explanation of religion?; Actually (indistinct) religion has to be defined as (indistinct),Prabhupāda, What is that (indistinct)
Guest (2): ; Prabhupāda: ; Guest (2),"(indistinct) to understand religion is (indistinct); Yes. They must be the same.Dharmaṁtusākṣadbhagavat-praṇītam[SB6.3.19].Religion means the course, or the laws given by God. Just like law means the law given by the state. I cannot manufacture law. The citizen cannot manufacture law. The law is manufactured by the legislative assembly of the government. Similarly, religion means the order given by God. Now we have to understand who is God, and what is His order, and how it is applicable to everyone. That is the system of religion. We cannot whimsically give some rituals as religion. The principle of religion is to obey the orders of God. Therefore the first principle is to know who is God. Unless I know what is God, then how I can know what is His order? So in theBhagavad-gītā,the religion is given that—(Aside:) you are feeling sleepy, you can go—theBhagavad-gītā,it is said thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].That is religion. We have manufactured so many types of religion, and here God says that ""You give up your manufactured religion. You just surrender unto Me."" This is religion. Religion means to surrender. A good citizen means to surrender to the government law. Similarly, a religious person means who has surrendered to God. Nowadays it has become a regrettable fashion that everyone is God, when we surrender to one. And this false prestige that ""I am God. I haven't got to surrender to anyone. I am God. What surrender?"" This atheism is going on and spoiling the whole human society. God has become so cheap. Any nonsense can claim, ""I am God."" That is the defect of the modern society. There is a great necessity to understand God. If everyone is God then where is the necessity of religion? If everyone is president then where is the necessity of lawmaking? So this is going on. This is very unfortunate situation. What is your idea?; (indistinct) that in ourHindutext, for example, that when it's expressedahaṁbrahmāsmi,so...",Prabhupāda," Ahaṁbrahmāsmiis the Vedic version, that is all right.Ahaṁbrahmāsmimeans, ""I am spirit. I am not this body.""So 'hammeans, ""I am the same quality as God."" But they are misinterpretation:So 'hammeans, ""I am God."" This is nonsense. This is going on."
Guest (2),That's misleading.,Prabhupāda, Misleading. People have become nonsense. (conversation between the two Indonesian guests) You have publishedBhagavad-gītāwith commentary or simple translation?
Guest (2),With commentaries.,Prabhupāda, So whose commentary you have followed?
Guest (2),"We try to take from various books and we try, at first we have to understand clearly their positions, then we put them in a simple way that everybody can understand it clearly. Only the part that's very difficult to (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," Now here,Bhagavad-gītā,in the Fourth Chapter it is said,imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam[Bg.4.1].You can open to the Fourth Chapter."
Guest (2),(Indonesian) but according to our opinions that religion is something that true living.,Prabhupāda, Something?
Guest (2),Something that we should live truly.,Prabhupāda," True living. Yes. True, just like good citizens..."
Guest (2),That's right.,Prabhupāda," Good citizenship means living under the direction of the government. That is good citizenship. Similarly, human life means to live nicely under the direction of God. The cats and dogs, they cannot understand. But the human life, (pause) That first verse:imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam,vivasvānmanaveprāhamanurikṣvākave'bravīt[Bg.4.1].So what is your explanation of this verse?"
Guest (2),You want to explain this into er... Do you want to explain this?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam,vivasvānmanaveprāhamanurikṣvākave'bravīt[Bg.4.1]."
Guest (2),"Yes. This actually is explaining the origins of the law, ancient law, that's obeyed by the man. It's the law given from the Vedic literature...",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa.
Guest (2),Yes.Kṛṣṇa(indistinct) and coming toIkṣvākuand...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that (indistinct) means, that means this knowledge should be received from the authority."
Guest (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, Just like...
Guest (2),So actually they have acquired it from one source.,Prabhupāda," Yes. One link. So that is being deviated. WhatKṛṣṇasaid toVivasvān, to the sun-god now everyone is speaking in his own way, not in that way."
Guest (2),That's right.,Prabhupāda," Therefore it is deviated. TheBhagavad-gītā, the Chapter, Fourth Chapter explains that you cannot understandBhagavad-gītāby your own interpretation. You must follow the instruction of the original speaker ofBhagavad-gītā. The original speaker isKṛṣṇa. So whatKṛṣṇasays, they have to follow it. Then it isBhagavad-gītā.Otherwise if you interpret it in a different way then it is notBhagavad-gītā.Now, whatKṛṣṇasays we have to understand it philosophically, ethically, scientifically, any way, any angle of vision. That is, that you can do. But you cannot change the version ofBhagavad-gītā.You cannot change. Just like Dr. Rādhākrishnan, in the Ninth Chapter whenKṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].Dr. Rādhākrishnan says ""It is not to theKṛṣṇaperson."" ButKṛṣṇaperson says,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,""You just always think of Me."" And he's deviating his readers, ""Not toKṛṣṇa."" How much harm he's doing. This is going on. Why? It is said,Kṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktaḥ,""Just think of Me. Just become my devotee."" What right he has got to say that here it is not toKṛṣṇa? This is going on. So if we interpret in that nonsense way then we shall not be able to understandBhagavad-gītā.We shall miss this point. Science does not mean that you have to change according to your whims. Two plus two equal to four. You cannot make it five or three. That is not possible. Then it is not science. No longer the scientific value of this two plus two remains. We follow that principle, and that is the only principle. So if you're actually serious aboutBhagavad-gītā,I do not know what is your commentary. I request you, ""Try to follow the instruction ofKṛṣṇa. Don't interpret in your own way. Then it will be (indistinct)."" Everyone has got (indistinct) all over the world. Therefore we are selling thisBhagavad-gītāAs It Isvery nicely. Our publisher's MacMillan Co. and their trades managers report is that ourBhagavad-gītāis increasing daily, sales, other decreasing. That is the report, and in October they published 50,000 copies, it is already finished. Now they have to plan it for the second edition. People are very much now, eager to readBhagavad-gītāAs It Is.So, imitating us, somebody's, another (chuckles) man, he said""Bhagavad-gītāAs It Was."" (laughs with everyone) Like that. So that will not harm our cause."
Guest (2),"(Indonesian) One thing Mr. (indistinct) would like to answer from you, that, according to different view, objective reply, the object of this (indistinct) life, the objective of our religion is to be prosperous in this world and hereafter.",Prabhupāda," No. This is (indistinct) Prosperous. That is also stated, how you can become prosperous. That..."
Guest (2),The problems work like this...,Prabhupāda, No. That is also stated...
Guest (2),Whether this question also...,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. This is there..."
Guest (2),This what it is.,Prabhupāda," Yes. In theBhagavad-gītāyou'll find this verse. (Aside:) Find out.Bhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram[Bg.5.29].Bhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram,suhṛdaṁsarva-bhūtānāṁjñātvāmāṁśāntimṛcchati.This is theśānti,prosperity. They are...Kṛṣṇasays that ""I am the Supreme Enjoyer. I am the sole proprietor of everything.""Sarva-loka-maheśvaram.Sarva-loka,not only of this planet, but other planets also.Loka.Lokameans planet,sarva-lokam.Sobhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram,suhṛdaṁsarva-bhūtānām.""I am the best, I mean to say, well-wisher friend of everyone.""Jñātvāmāṁśāntimṛcchati.If one understands these three things only, that God is the Supreme Enjoyer. We are not enjoyer. But God is Enjoyer. That God is the Proprietor of everything. Not we are proprietor. We are subordinate. In theVedasalso, it is stated,ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).The description of God is like that He's eternal amongst the eternals. We are also eternal, the living entities. And God is also eternal.Nityo nityānāṁ...cetana,He's the vital living force among all living forces. We are all living forces and He's the chief living force. Then what is the distinction between this singular number,nitya,and the plural number,nityas?The distinction is that that singular number,nitya,is maintaining this plural number,nityas.Ekobahūnāṁyovidadhātikāmān.That is the distinction. Otherwise God is also a living entity like us, like one of us. But he's the chief. Just like father and children. Father is the chief man in the family and he's providing all necessities to life for the children, for the wife (indistinct). Although the father is also living entity and the children are also living entities, but the father is providing the children, and the children are being provided by the father. So this is the understanding. Unless we understand this, there cannot be any peace. That is the Vedic version. Anyone who understands this, he gets peace. Otherwise there's no possibility of peace. If I think that I am the proprietor, if I think that I am the enjoyer, or, in other words, I am God, then you'll never get peace. That is not possible. That is a false. If one of the children thinks that I am the independent, then naturally father will say, ""All right, if you're independent, do your own business."" This is an example. So if you want peace then, as it is stated in theBhagavad-gītā,you have to learn these three things. It is not very difficult. To accept God as the Supreme Enjoyer, and God as the sole proprietor of everything, and He's the best friend of everyone. Then you have peace. Anyone can appreciate this. Anyone can adopt this principle and he'll be in peace. And so long one will falsely think that ""I am God. I am enjoyer, I am this, I am that."" Then he'll suffer. False notion will never make him happy. He must come to the true, factual idea. Now you can examine thatKṛṣṇasays that ""I am the Supreme Enjoyer."" Now let us understand this one fact, how Kṛṣṇa's the enjoyer. Now suppose here is some banana fruits. Who has created this banana fruit? You are not manufacturer, I am not manufacturer. Somebody has created. We accept God has created and that's a fact. Then who should be the enjoyer? I shall be enjoyer or God shall be enjoyer? Anything you create, you become the enjoyer. Anything I create, I become the enjoyer. So if God has created this banana fruit, then who should be enjoyer? God or I?"
Guest (2),God.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So our business is, we should offer this banana to God. ""So it is Your creation, it is Your thing. First of all You taste it, then we take it."" Then you become in peace. And if you falsely think that ""I have created this banana tree. I have worked so hard. Now the fruit is there. Now I am the enjoyer."" Then you are mistaken. Then next statement is,bhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-lokamaheś... [Bg.5.29],""I am the proprietor of everything in the world."" Now, beginning of this world,Bhūmi, land, this land, they're claiming this land Indonesian, this land American, this land Indian. But has the Indonesians or the Africans or the Indians created this land? Who has created this land?"
Guest (2),God.,Prabhupāda," Then He must be proprietor. But we are falsely claiming that, ""I am the proprietor."" So how you can be in peace? Suppose you steal something, somebody's property, and falsely claim, ""I am proprietor,"" you'll never be peace because it is not your thing. You have stolen it. So in this way, if you... philosophy can be studied that God is the Supreme Proprietor,tenatyaktenabhuñjīthāḥ[Īśomantra1].You can simply use what is given to you. You cannot claim other's property. Just like in animal life, animal life, they do not claim that ""This is my country."" The birds, they do not claim, but they live very peacefully. There are crows, there are spa... What is called? So many birds, they live anywhere, everywhere, but they do not claim, ""Oh, this is my country. This is my place."" They do not claim. Therefore they are free to move everywhere. So we have created a situation, Godless situation, therefore we are not in peace. So therefore, if you want peace, you must accept God, first of all.Suhṛdaṁsarva-bhūtānāṁjñātvāmāṁśāntimṛcchati[Bg.5.29],this is the way ofśānti.You cannot create yourśāntiin your own way. That is not possible. Just like the citizens, if they create their own way ofśānti,there cannot be peace. If they abide by the orders of the government, by the laws of the government, there will be peace. This is crude example. Similarly, if you do not accept God in the center as the Supreme Proprietor and the Supreme Enjoyer and the Supreme Friend, then there is no peace. This is the problem, I have given in the... What is that? You read it?"
Devotee,"Bhoktāraṁyajña-tapasāṁsarva-loka-maheśvaram,suhṛdaṁsarva-bhūtānāṁjñātvāmāṁśāntimṛcchati[Bg.5.29].""Translation:The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, obtain peace from the pangs of material miseries.""",Prabhupāda, Purport.
Devotee,"""The conditioned souls in the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. They do not know the formula for peace which is explained in this part of theBhagavad-gītā.The greatest peace formula is simply this. LordKṛṣṇais the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva and LordBrahmā. In theVedasthe Supreme Lord is described asparamīśvarānāṁparamaṁmaheśvaram.Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey. But actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature.""",Prabhupāda," That is the defect. Lord is the master of material nature, and we are conditioned by the material nature and still we are claiming, ""I am God."" Then?"
Devotee,"""Unless one understands thesebarefacts it is not possible to achieve peace in the world, either individually or collectively. This is the science ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. The LordKṛṣṇais the Supreme Predominator and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in completeKṛṣṇaconsciousness. In the Fifth Chapter is the practical explanation ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, generally known askarma-yoga.The question of mental speculation as to howkarma-yogacan bring liberation is answered herewith. To work inKṛṣṇaconsciousness is to work with the complete knowledge that the Lord is the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. DirectKṛṣṇaconsciousness isbhakti-yoga.andjñāna-yogais the path leading tobhakti-yoga.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge ofKṛṣṇaor Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact withmāyā, illusion, due to the desire to lord it overmāyā.And that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities.Kṛṣṇaconsciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while he is in the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is free from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on ones practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And attainingKṛṣṇaconsciousness by controlling the above mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage ofbrahma-nirvāṇa.The eight-foldyogamysticism is automatically practiced inKṛṣṇaconsciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There's a gradual process of elevation in the practice ofyama,niyama,āsana,prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra,dhāraṇā,dhyāna,andsamādhi.But these only preface perfection by devotional service which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.""",Prabhupāda," Therefore in another place, it is stated,bahūnāṁjanmanāmantejñānavānmāṁprapadyate[Bg.7.19],""After many, many births, when actually becomes wise,jñānavānmāṁprapadyate,he surrenders unto Me."" That is the perfection of knowledge. So this is... TheBhagavad-gītāis the only source of scientific knowledge of God and our relationship with God. I am very glad that you are already very serious about understandingBhagavad-gītā.But I request you only that try to... and understandBhagavad-gītāwithout any, our man-made interpretation. That will be my request."

Scholar,"Vivasvān, yes. And he's supposed to be the originator of...",Prabhupāda," He's the original person for the... There are two kinds ofkṣatriyas.One coming from the sun-god, and the other is coming from the moon god,candra-vaṁśa,sūrya-vaṁśa."
Scholar,That's a very good correction for us. (Indonesian),Prabhupāda, Personification means he... From the explanation it appears that actually there is no person.
Scholar,Yes. Originally there was person.,Prabhupāda," Not was, is, is still."
Scholar,Is still.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Their life is long duration.
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," There are kings, son of theManu, they lived for eight, elevenarbudayears. Onearbudayears means ten crores. One crore means ten millions. Ten million. So ten million years makes one crore. Such eleven crore years... There is history (indistinct) one of the Manus, he reigned over for elevenarbudayears. Onearbudameans ten millions of years. SoVivasvān,Vivasvānhe's living for so many years. Just like Brahmā's age is mentioned in theBhagavad-gītā.You find out the verse,sahasra-yuga-paryantam aharyadbrahmaṇoviduḥ[Bg.8.17].What is the Chapter?"
Devotee,"Chapter 8, 17.",Prabhupāda," Chapter 8, 17th verse."
Devotee,Sahasra-yuga-paryantam aharyadbrahmaṇoviduḥ[Bg.8.17].,Prabhupāda, Now what is the translation?
Devotee,"""By human calculations...""",Prabhupāda," No, no, I want to know this (indistinct)."
Scholar,"He who knows that the day ofBrahmāis thousandyugaand that the night ofBrahmāis also 5,000yugasis he who knows the truth of day and night.",Prabhupāda," Now, what is the explanation?"
Scholar,"The explanation is that, according to the traditions thatBrahmā, the day or the night of Brahmā's is one thousandyuga.",Prabhupāda, What is thatyuga?
Scholar,"It's mentioned in Chapter 4, 8. Four, verse eight.Yugais eighths, oneyugais, it's written here a hundred years. Oneyugais one eighths between the one incarnations to another incarnations.",Prabhupāda, But he has not given actual calculation of the years.
Scholar,"The years, he mentioned here.",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Scholar,"Only theyugaof...,Kṛta-yugais four thousand years. AndTretā-yugais three thousand years.",Prabhupāda, No.
Scholar,"Dvāpara-yugais two thousand years, andKali-yugais one thousand years.",Prabhupāda, One thousand years? (laughs) We have already passed five thousand years.
Scholar,"Wait. Oh. There is one thousand years, god's years. If it is human years it is four million three thousand, three hundred twenty thousand years.",Prabhupāda, Total. There is...
Scholar,Four millions and...,Prabhupāda, That is the totalyuga.
Scholar,"Yes, in human years.",Prabhupāda, Human calculation.
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then it is all right.
Indonesian Scholar: ,"Four million three thous... four, three, two...",Prabhupāda, About forty-three. About forty-three hundred thousands of years.
Scholar,Forty-three.,Prabhupāda, Hundred thousands of years. That makes ityuga.
Scholar,"Yuga,yes.",Prabhupāda, Yes. And Brahmā's daytime is such forty three hundred thousands of years multiplied by one thousand.
Scholar,One thousand.,Prabhupāda," Forty-three hundred thousands of years multiplied by one thousand. So forty-three hundred thousand... That forty three, five zeros, and again three zeros. Then how... what it comes?"
Scholar,Forty-three millions.,Prabhupāda," Eh? Forty-three, five zero, upon forty-three, add eight zeros. Then what it comes to?"
Scholar,Ah.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Scholar,"(Indonesian) Billion. Four billions of years, four billion years.",Prabhupāda, Four billion years is twelve hours of Brahmā's life.
Scholar,Just one day only.,Prabhupāda, One day only. Similarly one night. Then one day.
Scholar; Prabhupāda;; Scholar,Eight billion years one day ofBrahmā.; Yes. So that is the calculation.; Yes.,Prabhupāda," So things are very complicated, and people should understand very rightly. They are, they are frog philosophy. Frog philos... We say frog philosophy. Frog philosophy means that a frog who lives in the well, he has got experience of water, three cubic feet. And if he's given to understand that there is Atlantic Ocean, it is very difficult for him to understand. So on the whole, it is... But it is not very completely explained. And our point is this, or at least it will give some idea of theBhagavad-gītāto the people."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," But still it has to be expanded, has to be more explicitly ex..., advertised. So our point is this, that we are trying to spread this knowledge ofBhagavad-gītā.ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement means that we are spreading the knowledge ofBhagavad-gītā.So this is a world-wide organization and you know something about us, about this movement. So this part of the world, this is Southeast Asia?"
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Southeast Asia. Why not combine it, join together, and scientifically preach this cult ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. People will be very glad to accept it."
Scholar,"What is the place ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamhere, in this movement?",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Scholar,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?,Prabhupāda," Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamis... TheBhagavad-gītāis the preliminary study ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Just like before learning any literature, one has to read the first book, ABCD. TheBhagavad-gītāis the ABCD. It is just beginning of understanding of what is God. ABC. When one has passed the entrance examination, then he gets the opportunity of studyingŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.In theBhagavad-gītāthe last instruction issarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].ThatKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is explaining Himself, and at last He says that you surrender unto me. That is the most confidential part of knowledge. So if one has surrendered toKṛṣṇa, then He's admitted in the college of studyingBhāgavata.Before that he has no place. Just like without passing entrance examination, nobody's admitted in the college course. Similarly, without understandingBhagavad-gītāperfectly well, one cannot understand what isBhāgavata.Bhāgavatais the graduate study. So thisVedānta-sūtra,theVedānta-sūtrais the summarized study of all Vedic knowledge. AndŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamis the explanation ofVedānta-sūtra.So people are in darkness about this great knowledge and the science of God, all over the world. They are misled. They're being misled. Misled in this way, that this human form of life is specially meant for understanding God. The animals are not very (indistinct), but the present leaders they're keeping all the human being in the animal condition of life. Their chance of becoming conscious about God is being sacrificed, being misled, by so-called economic development, plans. All this economic development means, they're meant for this bodily comforts. Any department of knowledge at the present moment, they're simply aiming at giving some artificial comfort to this body. But these rascals, they do not care to know that however I keep this body comfortably, I'll have to give it up. And after giving up this body, what is my next position, they do not know. They do not know. This is darkness. This is darkness. So thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is an educational movement to give enlightenment to the people at large, to understand the values of life. Not to live like animals, eating, sleeping, sex life and dying. This is animal life. This is the best humanitarian welfare activities: to make people understand scientifically what he is, what is God, what is our relationship with God. So theBhagavad-gītāis the preliminary study of this science. So this should be presented very scientifically. One who knows perfectly well about thisBhagavad-gītā.These are the (indistinct) crucial point. That one...Kṛṣṇasays,imaṁvivasvateyogaṁproktavānahamavyayam[Bg.4.1].There's so many very touch(?) point. If they are not very, explained nicely people will remain in darkness."
Scholar,"But we think in the present day, Indonesia's, we think about harmonizing spiritual and material aspects of life, this our...",Prabhupāda," No. No. Harmonize means... First of all you must know what is harmonization. Harmonization means that this material life means bodily concept of life. This is material life. ""I am this body."" Generally people think like that: ""I am Indonesian."" ""I am American."" ""I amHindu."" ""I am Muslim."" And they take care of the country where he's born.Yasyātma-buddhiḥkuṇape tridhātukesva-dhīḥkalatrādiṣubhaumaijyadhīḥ,but this conception, bodily conception of life, has made the whole human society like cats and dogs. ""It is my land. It is my..."" Just like a dog. As soon as another dog comes. ""Bark, bark, bark, bark. Why you have come here? Why you have come here."" So this, this kind of harmonization is dog civilization."
Scholar,Well I think it's the...,Prabhupāda," No. No. No. You cannot... First of all you have to understand what is spiritual value of life. Then you can harmonize. If you do not know what is spiritual life, then what you can harmonize? That is the teaching ofBhagavad-gītā.In the beginning, whenArjunaacceptedKṛṣṇaasguru, then He began to explain about the value of life.Dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanam[Bg.2.13],find out this verse. It's in the Second Chapter. Which verse?"
Devotee,"Two, thirteen.",Prabhupāda," Second Chapter, thirteenth verse. Find out. Read it."
Scholar,Dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁyauvanaṁjarātathādehāntara-prāptir dhīrastattvanamuhyati[Bg.2.13].,Prabhupāda, Translation.
Scholar,"""After using this body, from childhood to youth and to old age and afterwards changes into another body. He who is wise, will not be, will not be disturbed.""",Prabhupāda," Now, here is the indication that after death we have to accept another body. Is it not?"
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Now, what kind of body you are going to accept? There are 8,400,000 varieties of bodies. Is it not? Do you know that?"
Scholar,"No, we don't know that. (indistinct) varieties of bodies.",Prabhupāda," There are forms of body in the water, in the land, so many trees, plants and there are so many insects, reptiles. Then birds, then there are beasts, then there are human being. So there are 8,400,000 forms of body. Here it is indicated that after giving up this body, the soul is going to accept another body. Now the human civilization, is it not duty of the human society to know what kind of body I am going to accept?"
Scholar,"No, I think it's up to God andkarma-kāṇḍa.",Prabhupāda," So then they must know what iskarma-phala.This is a fact.Karmaṇādaivanetreṇa[SB3.31.1].But they are..., do not know how to executekarma.They're doing all kinds of sinful activities. So, suppose after this body, on account of my sinful activities, I am going to become arator cat or snake or a tree, then what is the use of my so much, how you'd say, jumping over nationalism and this ism and that. If by nature I am going to accept next life the body of a cat and dog, or a tree, then what is the meaning of my, this so-called nationality at the present moment? Is it not the duty of the guardians who are taking care of the people or their son, to educate human being in such a way that they can get better body? What is that education? You are darkness, nobody knows what kind of body he's going to accept next life."
Scholar,At least we can start from living moral life.,Prabhupāda," But they're not living, they're not living. They are doing all kinds of sinful activities, they are drinking, they are having illicit sex, they're gambling, they're killing animals. Very sin... Everyone is engaged in these things. Maybe few percentage people are not engaged. But the throughout the whole world they're implicated in these four kinds of sinful activities. How you can expect that he's going to have next body very nice? No. That is not possible if you believe inkarma.According tokarma...Just like here in the human society there is law that if you kill a man, you should be also killed. Similarly, in God's laws so the same law is there.Māṁsa,māṁsa.If I eat an animal then he will have the chance to eat me next life. This iskarma.Who is caring for all these things? Who is caring? Nobody's caring. They're slaughtering animals like anything. So this kind of adjustment will not help. They must know scientifically what is the value of life. They must take information from authorized scriptures. Then the human society will be profitable. Otherwise no. Just like there is next life, a boy is educated to have good education so that in the next life—means when he's young man—he will be happy. He's preparing for the next life. The boy is being educated. That means he's preparing for the next youthful life. Youthful life is meant for preparation for the next old age life. Then what we are preparing now for the next body? That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:"
Scholar,"I think it's also according to the society. First we have to learn and after we come to the stage ofsannyāsī,only then we are...",Prabhupāda," It is no question ofsannyāsa,sannyāsayou take or not take, you must be in knowledge what is your next life."
Scholar,But if the...?,Prabhupāda, Do you mean to say we shall keep ourself in darkness about our next life? Is that your philosophy?
Scholar,"Well I think we have to start from... We give a child educations and thengṛhastha,andvānaprastha,...",Prabhupāda," That is all right,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,that is a, different stages. But the real education is that you have to die. You have to accept another body. What kind of body you are going to accept? If you do not know that what is this meaning ofgṛhastha,andvānaprastha,andsannyāsa?It is all rascal. If you do not... You miss this real point, then what is the meaning of this? There's no meaning. Simply by dressing in white cloth one becomesgṛhastha?And simply by dressing one, in this saffron cloth, he becomessannyāsī?By changing dress he becomes everything? He must know, that what is the aim of life. Everyone should know what is the ultimate of life."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," If he does not know, if he is in darkness for the next life, then what is the meaning of thisgṛhasthaandvānaprasthaand this...?"
Scholar,We believe in the stage of life so we prepare from childhood and after ...,Prabhupāda," Yes, not only we, but everyone should prepare from the childhood. This is... ThisBhagavad-gītāis not meant for a particular class of men. It is meant for the human society. So this education should be spread all over the world to save them from pitfalls of a life of darkness. That is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement. We do not mean that theBhagavad-gītāis meant for the Hindus, or for the Indians, or for the Indonesians. No, no, it is meant for everyone. They should know the science."
Scholar,"Are there Christian also, or Muslim also joining this...",Prabhupāda," What's this? Can't you see? There are many Christians, many..."
Scholar,Do they have to be Hindus first?,Prabhupāda," Well, why you are stressing to becomeHinduand Christian? It is that education for understanding the values of life."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," It is not the question ofHindu, Muslim. Any intelligent man will take it. Suppose if you want to be a great mathematician does it mean that you must be aHinduor Christian or Mohammedan?"
Scholar,"But by using threads, attributes ofHindureligion...",Prabhupāda," No, actually...Hindu, the word is not to be found in our Vedic scripture. It is the name given by the Mohammedans. So that is going on. Actually it is calledvarṇāśrama-dharma,fourvarṇas,fourāśrama.The fourvarṇas,thebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra.And fourāśramas-brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.Combined together it is calledvarṇāśrama.So unless the human being follows thisvarṇāśramaprinciple he's not a human being. He's animal, because animal has novarṇa, noāśrama.The human society must be divided. Then, just like in this body there are four divisions—the head division, the arms division, the belly division, and the leg division—all these are required for complete body. Although, by comparative study, head is the most important department, but still the leg is not... that we don't require leg. Leg is also required. Similarly, thebrāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra, they're required to function the society perfectly. That isvarṇa.And similarly, for spiritual emancipation there must be the division:brahmacārī,gṛhastha, vānaprastha,sannyāsa.So unless you accept this institution perfectly you cannot develop your consciousness as perfect human being."
Scholar,This divisions only in Hindus?,Prabhupāda," No, this division is meant for everyone."
Scholar; Scholar; Scholar,"Mohammedans also accept this divisions?; Yes. They're accepting. If you don't accept any scientific truth that is your business. That is your business. If you say-two plus two equal to four—""No I don't accept."" That is your business. But two plus two equal to four, that is a fact everywhere. Now how these boys have accepted? Now they have got sacred thread, they have becomebrāhmaṇa.; Yes.",Prabhupāda," And they're acting actually asbrāhmaṇa.There are many Mohammedans also. You came from Mohammedan. So it is the process of presenting the perfect educational system. Then everyone will accept. Any intelligent man will accept. It is a science. So you have to push this scientific movement throughout the whole world. That is our program. It is not a so-calledHinducult or a Indian cult. No. It is science to be accepted by everyone if he at all wants to, I mean to say, purify or make his life perfect. Otherwise, he's in darkness. He does not know what he's going to accept another body. He has to accept another body,tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].It does not say that this kind of body,dehāntaram,another body. Not..., it is up to you to select what kind of body I am going to accept. I am going to become a cat or dog or a demigod or a big man or a... They do not know yet. This science is unknown to the whole world. We are trying to push on this scientific movement. This is our position. So if you want to cooperate with this scientific movement, then we are prepared. But if you have some other idea, that is different thing. But if we take it seriously as a scientific movement, then we are prepared to cooperate. And if (you) should do, simply formality will not help us."
Scholar,"I think we think our stage has not yet come to that level becauseBhagavad-gītāonly, still very few understand it.",Prabhupāda," People are in darkness. You mean to say when you said that we have not come to that stage, that means that you want to remain in darkness? Does it mean? You don't want to take this light. You have not come to this stage. Does it mean you want to remain in darkness?"
Scholar,"Well, not really. But step by step we have to enlighten ourselves.",Prabhupāda," But step by step... You have to know it. Step by step is there. First of all you have to fix up that we have, this is the goal. Then we get step by step. But if you don't accept the principle, then you remain in darkness."
Scholar,I think the principle is the same but by the way to perform...,Prabhupāda," No, no. Your principle is to teach the principles ofBhagavad-gītā,then you have to take the principles ofBhagavad-gītā.If you want to readBhagavad-gītābut you remain in other atmosphere then it will not help. It is simply waste of time. That is explained in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam:vāsudevebhagavatibhakti-yogaḥprayojitaḥjanayati[SB1.2.7],thereforeBhagavad-gītāis also there. I'm talking to the most confidential part of this knowledge.Sarva-guhyatamam.What is that? Find out. The Eighteenth Chapter. I think sixty-three verse. What is that verse sixty-three?"
Devotee,"Ititejñānamākhyātam,""Thus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge.""",Prabhupāda," Before that verse.Sarva-guhyatamam.Ah, yes, yes. Sixty-three. Just open to sixty-three."
Scholar,Sixty-three.,Prabhupāda, Read it. [break]
Scholar,(indistinct) probably do...,Prabhupāda, Whatever you like.
Scholar,Whatever you like.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Whatever you like. That independence is there always. But he has... Just like we are speaking. This is the aim of life. Now if you like then take, you'll not take—that depends on your independence. So that independence is all... Before that independence is there, therefore we are sometimes degrading from this human life to cats' and dogs' life. So it is the duty of the human society to save the human being to degrade, from becoming again cats and dogs, or to elevate him higher and higher. Does it mean that we are, we shall be satisfied with our present stage of life without knowing what we are going to accept? Is that very nice proposal? Or we shall try to elevate the human society, that is higher."
Scholar,"Our aim is the same, to elevate the human being, but...",Prabhupāda, But then you have to accept the means.
Devotee,Yes.,Prabhupāda," If you do not accept the means, simply expecting that our aim is the same, will not act. You have to accept the means. That means, it is explained in the next verse, sixty-four,sarvadharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66].What is that? Sixty-four?"
Scholar,"Sixty-four,sarva-guhyatamaṁbhūyaḥ.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Sarva-guhyatamaṁbhūyaḥśṛṇumeparamaṁvacaḥ, iṣṭo 'si medṛḍhamititatovakṣyāmitehitam.Then sixty-five,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65],māmevaiṣyasisatyaṁtepratijānepriyo 'si me. This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So one has to become... If one is actually eager and serious for fulfilling the aim of human life then he has to take to this principle ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness-man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru,māmevaiṣyasisatyaṁtepratijānepriyo 'si me.This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. So one has to become, if one is actually eager and serious for fulfilling the aim of human life, then he has to take to this principle ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru,māmevaiṣyasisatyaṁtepratijānepriyo 'si me [Bg.18.65].So if you do not teach this lesson to the human society then he will remain in the darkness. This is the purport. This is the purpose ofBhagavad-gītā."
Scholar,Māmhere meansKṛṣṇa?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Scholar,OrBrahmā.,Prabhupāda, Why you bringBrahmā? Then you have not understoodKṛṣṇa.
Scholar,We are asking.,Prabhupāda, Why you are asking? Because you do not understand what isKṛṣṇa.
Scholar,(indistinct) here.,Prabhupāda, You are asking because you do not understandKṛṣṇa.
Scholar,Because it's mentioned here.,Prabhupāda," Oh. He saysmām.He says everythingmām, man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65],māmeva,everythingmām,""I"". So why you should bringBrahmā?Kṛṣṇasays everything ""I"". You are asking aboutKṛṣṇa. That means you do not understandKṛṣṇa. But it is clearly saidmām,Kṛṣṇa. We have, therefore, given the name ""Kṛṣṇa consciousness"", nothing else, neitherBrahmāconsciousness, nor God consciousness. ""Kṛṣṇa consciousness."" The whole concentration is toKṛṣṇa."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is the fact.
Scholar,The explanation here is that from thisślokato the seventy-two...,Prabhupāda, Hm?
Scholar,From thisśloka...,Prabhupāda, Which thisśloka?
Scholar,From sixty-four.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Scholar,To seventy-two.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Scholar,"Kṛṣṇagains or speaks as aguru,guru-śiṣya-samudbhava.",Prabhupāda," Well,Kṛṣṇais the originalguru, (indistinct)gurufor everyone."
Scholar,So here is as aguru.,Prabhupāda, Guruis the representative ofKṛṣṇa. Thereforeguruwill also teach to surrender toKṛṣṇa.
Scholar,"From this movement what has been, what is the plan, and what is the...",Prabhupāda," Everyone should become a devotee ofKṛṣṇa. That is the plan. That is the whole plan. That is stated.Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65].Just like this chanting ofHareKṛṣṇa, this isman-manā,always thinking ofKṛṣṇa.HareKṛṣṇaHareKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaKṛṣṇaHareHare/HareRāmaHareRāmaRāmaRāmaHareHare. ThisKṛṣṇachanting means thinking ofKṛṣṇa, immediately,man-manā.Mad-bhaktaḥ,there is in the temple,Rādhā-Kṛṣṇadeity, they are worshiping.Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājī,they are regularly, according to the rules and regulations from morning to up to ten, there is worshiping method.Man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65],offer your obeisances. Then you come back to Me. That is perfection. They do not know where they are going, whether they are going to be cats and dogs. But here by this process you go back to home, back toKṛṣṇa. Therefore this should be adopted. Why should you spoil your energy to become cats and dogs? This is..."
Scholar,It's time for real life.,Prabhupāda," That is real life. That is real life, to go back toKṛṣṇa. Otherwise you do not know where you are going. After all, you're preparing for something next. But your energy is being spoiled because do not know. But if you becomekṛṣṇa-yājī,always thinking ofKṛṣṇa, is it very difficult?Man-manā.You think ofKṛṣṇa, you worshipKṛṣṇa, you are going to the temple, you're offering some prayers. That's all right. What is the difficulty if you offer the prayer toKṛṣṇa? You have to do the same thing in a systematic way. Thenmad-yājino 'piyāntimām[Bg.9.25],then you go back toKṛṣṇa. Next life is to go back to home, back toKṛṣṇa. That is perfection of life."
Scholar,"Well, I think theBhagavad-gītāalso mentions that many ways lead to God.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Many ways, that is all right. But the best way He suggests who comes back to Me. (chuckles) Many ways, there may be. You can go to hell, that is also another way. Therefore He says in the sixty-..., seven,sarvadharmānpari...""I have already suggested many ways. You give up, kick up all these ways. You simply surrender unto Me."" That is the most confidential part of knowledge. So intelligent man should take it. And still if he likes many ways let him do that. Let him go to hell. Who can check it?Yāntidevavratādevānpitṝnyāntipitṛ... [Bg.9.25].He has suggested. You can go to the higher planetary system, you can remain here, you can become cats, you can become dogs, you can becomebhūta,ghost. You can become anything you like, but if you becomemad-yājī, if you become a devotee of Me, then you come to me. Now it is up to..., our position to make choice whether he is going to be a ghost, or become, going to become the associates ofKṛṣṇa. (indistinct)?"
Scholar,What is His Divine Grace idea aboutKali-yuga?,Prabhupāda, Kali-yugameans degraded age.
Scholar,It's the time for that.,Prabhupāda, Degradation.
Scholar,It's the time for that.,Prabhupāda," Yes. It has begun for the last 5,000 years. It's going on."
Scholar,And how long it will be?,Prabhupāda," And it will remain for another 427,000's of years. The whole duration is 432,000's of years, out of which we have passed only 5,000 years. That means the balance is 427,000 years. So at the end, people will forget everything about God. There are descriptions of theKali-yuga. So if we again come back toKali-yuga, it is not very good for us. The symptoms have already begun. So actually, we must do something by which people may derive some benefit. Simply for formalities there is no value. And that, things are already mentioned in theBhagavad-gītā.You have to simply follow the program, then life will be perfect. (Hindi) Fruit. Give them thisprasādam,this fruit."
Scholar,How long this movement has been started?,Prabhupāda," This movement started from since 5,000 years, sinceKṛṣṇaappeared. We have not start... manufactured this movement. We are just pushing on the same movement, rightly, that's all. We can say how long this movement has been started rightly."
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Prasādammeans little. The others may come, what will be such and such, again you have to bring, till somebody comes."
Devotee,We'll be going shortly.,Prabhupāda," That's all right, but if somebody comes, again you have to go, bring back. People are not come here to fill up their bellies. (laughs) Littleprasāda,that will satisfy. Only one piece."
Scholar,This movement started all over the world now.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes."
Scholar,How many countries for instance?,Prabhupāda," Whole world. Especially in America. America, Europe. From here we are going New Zealand, Australia."
Scholar,Are they in Arabic countries also?,Prabhupāda," Arabic countries also, our men from (indistinct) that is an Arabic country. We send to Pakistan also, but due to this war, the American Embassy, they asked us to (indistinct). We are going again, Bangladesh. We have got Russia and we are negotiating with China also. So because you are here, you have taken the importance ofBhagavad-gītā, why not do it rightly and propagate nicely. That is our proposition."
Scholar,We will think about it.,Prabhupāda," Yes, Think about it."
Devotee; Scholar,(indistinct) around 7. (indistinct); (indistinct) life after death.,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, bring (indistinct). Call him."
Devotee,He has left.,Prabhupāda," Oh, he has left, all right. You come here, near."
Scholar,"Life after death, he is asking.",Prabhupāda," Yes, there is life after death. This is your question?"
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That whether there is life after death. What is your question?
Guest,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," What is your opinion? It is a fact. Just like you are a child, now you are a young man. So you have changed your body. Similarly, when you change this body, you get another body."
Scholar,Life after death.,Prabhupāda, That is life after death.
Guest,Is there any world...,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Guest,Any description of the worlds...,Prabhupāda," World is vast. So according to yourkarma...Just like you have got a particular type of body. You are young man, there is another young man also. Still, his body and your body is not exactly the same. His bodily feature, your bodily feature, his intelligence, your intelligence, they are all different. But a child grows to become young man, that's a fact. You are a child, another child was there. So they have got now different body. Just like you have got a different body from your childhood life. Is it not? But you know that you had a childhood body, although the body is not there. This is transmigration from one body to another. Just like a dream at night. You change this body. You accept another body. And although you're lying down on your bed, you've gone to some other place. Subtle body. Take for... This is a fact that we change our bodies so many ways, but I, the soul, I remain. So therefore, when this body will not exist I'll exist in another body. That is confirmed in theBhagavad-gītā,najāyatenamriyatevā,nahanyatehanyamāneśarīre[Bg.2.20].We can experience this, and it is confirmed in theśāstra.After destruction of this body we are not disturbed. I, as living entity, I remain, I accept another body."
Scholar,Maybe the question is that whether the life after death is the same like our life here...,Prabhupāda," But, but, that is not (indistinct). If you get another body, naturally the same way of life. Same way of life means this life... This material body means four functions: eating, sleeping, sex intercourse, and defense. So as soon as you take another body, it's the same business (indistinct). It may be dog's life, it may be cat's life, or it may be human life. But the business is the same: eating, sleeping, sex intercourse and defense."
Scholar,"And the idea ofnirvāṇa,and soul...",Prabhupāda," That is another thing. That is an... That you have to prepare. That is not for the cats and dogs. That is meant for really human beings, those who are actually executing life as human beings. That is not for the cats and dogs. (pause) All right. Thank you very much."
Scholar,Thank you for this time.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Now my request is that you have got some, you have so many, you're interested inBhagava...Preach like this."
Scholar,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, What he's asking?
Scholar,About what we are planning.,Prabhupāda," Planning, but you're not prepared for the planning. Otherwise I could have given you the plan. But you are not prepared. You say you think of. Then you think of, what can I do?"
Scholar,Yes.,Prabhupāda, I was prepared to give you the plan.Yathecchasitathākuru[Bg.18.63].

These, our Indian people, they're not interested in God. They're interested in (Hindi), some blessing, because they can make improvement in their material position.; Yes.",Prabhupāda," So therefore these rascals come, they give them (Hindi or sounds like ""ashes bath"", maybe referring to Sai Baba), I give them, ""I am so powerful, I give you (Hindi),"" and they give them money, ""Oh, here is asādhu."" They'll get (Hindi) very cheaply, and make money. Instead of twolakhs,I'll make tenlakhs,by the (Hindi). And he's Sai Baba, like rogues, they come to show them some magic, that ""I have got some power, I can do anything I like, and if you become my devotee, you will improve."" All these yogis, everything, they do like that. MaheshYogialso: ""Take mymantra.Within six months you become perfect man and whatever you like, you can do."""
Devotee (3),Haha. No restrictions.,Prabhupāda," No. There is business only. Why there should be restrictions? Everyone does so, beginning from Vivekananda, Aurobindo, everyone. Aurobindo also used to say that you haven't got to do anything, you simply think of me, just likeKṛṣṇasays: ""Simply think of Me."" (indistinct) [break]"
Devotee (3),"One man came here, ahaṭha-yogī,so-calledhaṭha-yogī,and he was putting water in his nose and cloth in his stomach and all twisting this way, going under water, and they were all very amazed and many people came to see.

Devotee (3),And enjoy.,Prabhupāda," There is a proverb, that a drowning man catches even a straw. A man is drowning, he's seeing the straw is floating, he wants to catch it.

Devotee (1); Devotee (2); Devotee (1),"No. It is impersonal interpretations.; So we must encourage them to translate Prabhupāda'sBhagavad-gītā,because they're inclined. They like... They want subject matters. So why not translate Prabhupāda's books and let the government distribute them and introduce them.; Only they several times suggest to me that we donate the books because they don't have money to print their own books.",Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1),"They have not facilities, money, to actually print and publish and distribute. That is why they are so attracted to us because we have the books and they know we have the power to print and distribute. But they have no money, no power to do it.",Prabhupāda," No. If they want, we can do that."
