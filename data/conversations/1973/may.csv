SvarūpaDāmodara,"When I drove, so the stars were very shining in the sky very clear. [break]",Prabhupāda, Man-made rubbish. Although they have got machine. [break] What other things they can produce there?
SvarūpaDāmodara,From sand?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"There is a compound that is called silicon carbide. That is, I think, it is very hard, as hard as diamond They make silicon carbide. I'm not sure but silicon carbide or tungsten carbide. They are used for cutting diamond. They are harder than diamond. Very strong, very hard. They combine this with carbon. It requires tremendous amounts of force to do this, high temperature, high pressure. (pause)",Prabhupāda, Anything eatables?
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda,"(Laughs) No, not so far.; Future.",Prabhupāda," ""In future."" But God creates so many eatables from sand. Do you know?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"The smaller birds, they are eating something from sand?",Prabhupāda," No, even for man. The cantaloupe, watermelon, they are produced in sand in large quantity.Kharmuja.(Bengali)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Lemons also.,Prabhupāda," Not lemon. Watermelon. These are the products of the desert, as well as dates. Just like these date trees can grow in sand. (pause)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday'sBhāgavatalecture, the example that the hundred dollar bill, one hundred dollar bill. So if somebody picks up and takes it, he's a thief, and if somebody who just does not care...",Prabhupāda, Does not take it.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, he's also not good. And the one who takes up and says, ""Whose coin is this?"" Then he's good.",Prabhupāda," Yes, his service is better."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, but how about the one who picks up and he doesn't find the owner of the coins but he offers toKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda," No, he must find out. Because there are so many men, some of them must have lost that. So so far Kṛṣṇa's property is concerned, everyone knows, ""This is Kṛṣṇa's property."" There is no need of finding out.Īśāvāsyamidaṁsarvam[Īśomantra1].Just like everyone knows, ""This is American state."" Where is the difficulty to find out? That was an example, but so far things are concerned, we know that, as we know that this land belongs to the American state, similarly this is false. Actually, everything belongs to God. There is no difficulty to understand. You have not created this ocean. You have not created this land. You have created nothing. You are simply stealing. That is your business. So how you do not know that it belongs to God? Everyone should know. This is knowledge. If I create something, I must enjoy it. Rather, the Vedic injunction is that you do not enjoy anything which you cannot create. You do not enjoy anything which you cannot create."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So we cannot create anything so...,Prabhupāda," Therefore you cannot enjoy anything. You have to accept everything asprasādam.First of all you take sanction from the proprietor. Then you he will give... That is your business. Just like if I want to use this land, I have to take permission from the government, that ""I want this land. Give me permission."" So when government gives you permission you can use. Otherwise you will be criminal. You cannot say, ""Oh, there are so much land, let me encircle it with my fence and I live there."" No. Immediately criminal. You cannot do anything as you like with this ocean. Can you do? No you have to take permission from the government. Just like the fishing boats, they have got government permission. Otherwise they cannot. Therefore in theĪśopaniṣadit is said,tenatyaktenabhuñjīthāḥ[Īśomantra1].Tenatyaktena.""When it is sanctioned, when it is given to you, then you enjoy.""Māgṛdhaḥkasyasviddhanam.""Do not touch anyone's property."" This is Vedic injunction. So if everything belongs to God, how you can touch it without His permission? But they are rascals. They do not know who is God, where is God, how to take permission. They do not know. Therefore they become criminals. They are suffering. Encroaching upon God's property and therefore they are suffering. All these things are stated in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Everything belongs to God, and because we are sons of God, we can use the father's property. But not more than what I require. Just like in a family everything is father's property, and if you eat more, all the good things in the family, that is not allowed. You must take what the mother or the father gives you. That is your business. Similarly everything is God's property. Everyone, even the birds, beasts, everyone has right to use the father's property. Just like the birds. They will use. Just like they are picking up the small fishes. So as much they require, they are allowed, ""Take it."" But they are not making any stock for speculation. Man does that. As soon as there is some good harvest, ah, immediately they... [break]... problem. If everyone only takes as much he requires, there is no problem in the world. But he wants to take more. Just like you Americans, you have covered so many thousands of miles. And you don't allow anyone. ""No, you cannot enter. Here is gun."" What is this nonsense? It is God's property. Why do you disallow others. Let them come. So there is no question of over-population. There are so much land in Australia, in Africa, here in America, that ten times of the present population can be provided. God has provided. But these rascals will not allow. So there is overpopulation in India, in China and other places, and there is problem. They are trying to occupy more land but you will not allow. Therefore war, there is war. So we create problems. Otherwise God has supplied us enough. You can use it; as much as you like you can use what you have... They are creating trouble and the scientists giving them, ""Yes, I am giving you this chemical composition. You drop on the enemies' camp."" This is scientific research, to impel the rascals. (laughter) The rascals, rogues, they are trying to usurp other's property, and the scientists helping them. That's all. If you help one murderer, if you help one thief, then you also become criminal. Is it not? So they are helping one another, all these thieves and rogues. Therefore there is so much trouble in the world. They are all criminals.Stenaevasaucyate[Bg.3.12].One who does not recognize the proprietorship of the Lord, he is a thief. Find out, take statistics how many people recognizes God. Take statistic. Everyone will say, ""Eh! What is God, nonsense."" Everyone will say. Therefore they are in trouble. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes this fact:māyār bośe, jāccho bhese, Khāccho hābuḍububhāi, jīvkṛṣṇa-dās, e biśwās, korle to ār duḥkhonāi.As soon as you believe in God and accept yourself as eternal servant, there is no more problem. Everything is there. But they are being carried away by the illusory energy. Therefore they are under the control of time and nature.māyār bośe, jāccho...Just like these seaweeds are carried by the waves, ""Get out,"" similarly, one who is not accepted... There are other seaweeds, they are not thrown away, but these sea weeds, because little outside—thrown away. There are millions and millions of fishes, they are not thrown away, because they have surrendered to the sea, under the protection of the sea. The sea is protecting them. Just see. Similarly you surrender, you will be protected.Kṛṣṇasays that.Ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmimāśucaḥ:[Bg.18.66] Don't be worried. I will give you protection. You surrender unto Me."" And the scientists say, ""Oh, what is God. These are all nonsense, primitive ideas. Primitive."" They have become advanced. Therefore they should give up the idea of God. Now India is declared famine. What these leaders will do?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are fighting each other.,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇais asking you that ""You realize Me."" ""No, I cannot see You."" ""No, why cannot see you? Here is water. You are drinking water."" ""Yes."" ""I am water, I am the taste of the water. Why don't you see Me?""Prabhāsmiśaśi-sūryayoḥ:""I am the sunshine."" So who is not seeing the sunshine? Why the rascals says, ""I do not see God""? God says, ""I am here."" But he says, ""I do not see."" Liar. If you are in my front, if I say, ""Here I am,"" if you say, ""No, sir, I don't see you,"" what is this? Similarly, God is before you in the form of sunshine. Don't you see the sunshine? Why do you say that I do not see God? Who has not seen the sunshine? In the morning, very early in the morning, you see God. That isGāyatrīmantra.Oṁbhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥtatsaviturvareṇyaṁbhargodevasya.That is the obeisances to the sun.Savitṛ. Savitṛmeans,savitāmeans sun. In the very beginning we see God by the sunshine, and then think of the sunshine, how much potential it is, how everything is being produced by the sunshine. As soon as there is no sunshine, we become disturbed, so many business become disturbed. So why don't you understand that without God's presence, we cannot do anything. Where is the difficulty? Does it require any very big philosophical speculation? The rascal will not admit as directed in the Vedic literature. That is their fault. Otherwise where is the difficulty? No difficulty. What is the explanation of these scientists of the sunshine?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They say the sunshine is just some... Sun is a... There is a gaseous material, very hot temperature. So the rays are coming from the sun...",Prabhupāda," That's all right, but it can kill you. Is it not? So when did you accept with God? Sunshine, if it increases a little temperature, millions of you will be killed immediately. So why don't you accept sun as God? Therefore, according to Vedic principles, sun in the beginning is accepted as God."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They take it as a material object.,Prabhupāda," Then accept you are under its control. God means controller.Īśvara. Īśvarameans controller. God means controller. So He is controlling you. It is material but it is not under your control. You are under its control. So if anything is controlling you, that is God. God means controller. If you cannot seeKṛṣṇa, you can see the sun."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The sun is a product ofKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Yes, energy.Yac cakṣureṣasavitāsakalagrahāṇām.Sun is working under the order of... Just like if you don't see the managing director or the proprietor of a firm, the immediate boss who is controlling you, you have to obey. In the office or in the factory. Similarly, you cannot see directly God, but God's agent is working. Why don't you obey? God's agent is working? How it is working?Yasyājñayābhramatisaṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ,exactly in time by the order ofKṛṣṇa, rising exactly in the time, without any deviation even by 1/10,000th part of a second, astrological calculation. Is it not? So how it is working? Under whose order it is working?Śāstrasays, ""By the order ofKṛṣṇa.""Yasyaājñayā.""Under whose order he is working,""govindamādi-puruṣam,""I worship thatGovinda."" Theśāstrais giving you information, that he is working under, he must be working under... Otherwise why it is so accurate, so punctual, unless there is some direction? Unless there is order of God, why this big ocean is so obedient, it is not coming here? Why don't you study like this? Where is the difficulty? There must be some direction that ""You Pacific Ocean, you are so big, that's all right, but you cannot come here. Remain up to this."" Otherwise why you are feeling so safety although in the front of a big ocean. If the ocean likes, within a second, he can finish us immediately. But she will not do, because there is order. Similarly sun. Sun is also moving under the order. You have to study like that. If you do not see God, see how God's order is being carried out. Then you will understand. Just like we do not see President Nixon. But you know there is direction, and the government is going is going on under his direction. That we can know. This is seeing of God to see how things are going on under His order. That is seeing of God. Just like from long distant place like this hills, we are seeing, but at the same time not seeing distinctly. You are seeing those, but you do not see the detail. Similarly you are seeing God by these things, but because you are not so powerful, you are not seeing Him in detail. But you are seeing God. You cannot say that ""I don't see God."" How can you say? These are the directions. You are seeing that things are going on under direction.Yasyājñayā.Therefore you have to...śāstrayonitvāt.TheVedāntasays, ""You have to understand God throughśāstra;""by the scriptures you have to understand.śāstrayonitvāt.Everything is there. Theśāstragives you direction. Therefore human being is meant to study theśāstras.Theśāstras,Vedic literature, is meant for the human being, not for the cats and dogs. If you don't consult theśāstras,then you remain a cats and dogs. That's all. Why you are taking so much trouble, writingśāstra,explaining to you? So that you may come to the real platform from the platform of cats and dogs. That is our mission. That is the duty of the spiritual master.Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇausad-dharma-saṁsthāpakaulokānāṁhita-kāriṇau.The spiritual master is the most beneficent friend, he is giving you direction from theśāstra.Lokānāṁhita-kāriṇau:""He is the real welfare worker for the human society.""Lokānāṁhita-kāriṇautri-bhuvanemānyau śaraṇyākarau,rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena mattālikauvanderūpa-sanātanauraghu-yugauśrī-jīva-gopālakau.You seeśāstrais giving direction. So many lawyers are going to the school colleges to learn the government laws. Why they are taking so much trouble? Just to give people the direction that ""You work under this direction, you will not be in difficulty."" Similarly the spiritual master is the lawyer. He knows things as they are. He gives direction to the disciple so that he'll be happy. He will not be in trouble. This isguru-śiṣya-sampatti.Yasyaprasādādbhagavat-prasādaḥ**.By the mercy ofgurueverything is...Bhagavat-prasādaḥ,immediately, mercy of God. Oh, it is coming. No. Now, one should study the sprinkler. We'll give credit, ""Oh, who has manufactured this sprinkler?"" But there is no glorification for the original sprinkler, who takes all the water in the sky and sprinkles all over. There is no appreciation, rascal. You appreciate this thing."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"The engineers, they'll say, ""Oh, we have made this.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, but another engineer, such a big engineer, he has no appreciation. Just see."
Devotees,All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (Prabhupāda gets in car),Prabhupāda, We simply ask that you appreciate the original engineer. That is our... (end)
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Recently I went to a lecture called ""The origin of life."" It was given by a well-known biochemist whose name is Professor Stanley Miller. He was talking about the origin of life.",Prabhupāda, Yes. So what is origin of life?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"He said that there are twenty amino acids, twenty of them which are necessary for the maintenance of life, the living entities. So he was discussing how these amino acids are formed before the dawn of creation, and he had so many theories, all nonsense.",Prabhupāda, So did you not protest?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes. Then there was... After his lecture... It was a one hour long seminar, and there was question and answer. So they invited questions. Nobody asked.",Prabhupāda, So you did not ask?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, I asked later on. I asked, that ""Your topic is about origin of life, but you are not talking about the origin of life. So there is no basis of your argument.""",Prabhupāda, Very good.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Then I asked, ""Supposing I give you the chemical materials, say, the molecules likes amino acids and the big molecules like DNA andRNA..."" These are the molecules, which they think necessary for the maintenance of life. ""Supposing I give you all these chemical compounds, then do you think that you will be able to put life into it. If you get all the chemical materials necessary, but will you be able to put life into it?"" Then he said, ""I do not know.""",Prabhupāda, Then why you are talking nonsense? (laughter) Then? People did not laugh?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes. No, everybody was silent. Everybody was silent because everybody believes that life started from matter, all the, in the audience. So I said that ""Your basis means life started from matter. That means..."" He was saying that when the earth, before the life started, there was no living entities on earth. Then I said, ""How do you know there is no living entities on earth?"" Then he could not answer.",Prabhupāda," Just see. Very good. Yes. You have to go and lecture all the universities, calling these rascals fools. That will be our mission. They do not know anything and talking all nonsense. That's it. There was nobody to challenge till now. Now we are creating persons to challenge these rascals. That is our credit. Till now whatever nonsense they are talking, people thought, ""Oh he is a big scientist."" Now our scientist will protest against them, stop them talking all nonsense. That is what we want. If a lay man like me goes and protesting, he may say that ""First of all you come to my level, then I shall talk with you."" Now, he cannot talk with you like that. Because you are on the level. So challenge all this nonsense. Why they talk nonsense? So later on, other persons, they did not talk with you?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, the chairman of the department, he was telling later on that ""About theology let us talk later on."" So he dispersed the meeting after that. Theology, they thought, that I was talking on theology.",Prabhupāda," It is not theology, it is science."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, it is science. But he was assuming like that because his business is to protect the... This is outside speaker, comes from outside the university.",Prabhupāda, So how do you say it is theology?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"He was just commenting like that, that...",Prabhupāda," So you should have presented, ""No, it is not theology. I am talking on the scientific basis."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"I said, ""Why not think like life started from life? What is wrong in it?"" Because he was talking that life started from matter. So why not think like life started from life? What is wrong in it? That is why they thought I was talking about theology, when I asked them.",Prabhupāda," Yes, this protest must be now. If they accept life started from life, then they will have to accept God. That is their difficulty. That is their difficulty. And practically we have no experience... We can see life started from life, father begetting child. We can see father is a living man, and another child will be born. But where is life starting from matter? Where is that evidence? Life starting from life, we have got practical experience, but where is the evidence that life started from matter?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are assuming. There is no proof. They just think, they just assume it.",Prabhupāda," Assuming, what is that? There is no proof?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,There is no proof.,Prabhupāda," What is their proof? What they go on, proof?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are just speculating that life started spontaneously. There was a time, they said, it started all spontaneously, only once.",Prabhupāda," That's all right. But life, whether begins from life or matter? That is the question. You are saying that life started from matter. We are saying life started from life. How to make solution of this question? For life starting from life, we can see practically. Birds, beasts, human beings, they are begetting children, eggs. The life from life, he's a living entity. That we have got proof. But where is the proof that life started from the matter? Where is that proof? Just give one instance that ""Here is a life starting from matter."" Where is that instance? Anyway, at least one audience protested. It will be recorded. And he said, ""I do not know."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Oh, then what kind of scientist he is? So they know that you are theologist?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"In the department everybody knows. (laughter) There is one theoretical chemist. His name is Max Muster (?). He is from Germany. He is a theoretical chemist. Once I invited him to come to Los Angeles to talk with Prabhupāda. He agreed, and but then he told me that he will think for one day whether he will come or not. Then next day he told me that he is afraid. ""I cannot come because I am afraid that I will be put on the walls."" (laughter) But he is very philosophical. He believes in God. He has some... That's why if you talk with him, very nice.",Prabhupāda," So that is also nice. We are not afraid of meeting any philosopher or scientist, but they are afraid. That is our credit. All scientists know that they are on the wrong basis, but because they are scientists, they say like that. That is their position. They do not believe in their own statement. Therefore he said, ""I do not know."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,Because there is no solid background.,Prabhupāda," No. (pause,japa)You and Dr. Rao just make a combination, world-touring. I shall give you all expenditure. And go to the universities, scientists, and talk with them. Ourkīrtanaparty also will go. We challenge all scientists, ""Come on."" We shall pay all expenditure. Ask Dr. Rao to come and join. Just like in Calcutta University, all the students... No, one leader student, he came. He talked about economic development, and he said that ""Our students did not derive any faith by your theological statement."" So I told them that ""Because you are all rascals, therefore you could not."" I told them freely. Because in theBhagavad-gītā...Because they are student of Sanskrit. And in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,namāṁduṣkṛtinomūḍhāḥprapadyantenarādhamāḥ[Bg.7.15].""So you are amongst these. You areduṣkṛtinas,sinful, lowest of the mankind, and the university is responsible for creating such rascals."" So professors clapped and later on they said, ""Swamiji, you have rightly said."" All the professors said. And so far economic question is concerned, the birds, beasts, animals, they have no economic concern. Why you have got? You are less than bird and beast, you have created this economic problem.Harernāmaharernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21].Where is the economic question? The small birds, tiny birds, they are solving their economic question, coming (makes sound:) ""bup, bup,"" finished. They are not stocking, they are not thinking of tomorrow, but are satisfied. They have got eating, sufficient eating, sufficient sex, sufficient intelligence to defend. As soon as we go, immediately they fly away. That is defense. They know how to defend them. They immediately understand, ""They are human beings, stronger. They may do some harm. Let us fly away."" So these things are everywhere, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. There is no scarcity. Only scarcity isKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That we have to preach. Theology... Logy means science, is it not?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Everything, logy means science. So theology is also science. Why they reject theology ""Yes, you are talking..."" What kind of scientist you are? It is a ""logy,"" it is a science. Why you are giving preference to one ""logy"" to another? What kind of scientist you are? Even though I am talking of theology, why should you reject it? In Vedic knowledge, ""logy"" is the basic...Nyāya-prasthāna,śruti-prasthāna,smṛti-prasthāna.These are the three ways of understanding the Absolute Truth."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Logic and argument?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Nyāya-pra...Just likeVedānta-sūtra,it is logic and argument to approach the Absolute Truth.Athātobrahmajijñāsā:""Now it is the time for inquiring aboutBrahman."" This is logic. Because other animals, they cannot inquire about the Absolute Truth, but human being can, therefore the first proposition is,athaataḥ,""Now because you have got human form of life, therefore you should now inquire about the Absolute Truth."" This is the beginning. It is logic. And actually we feel, ""Who has created the ocean? Who has created the stars? How it is floating? Whether there are human beings?"" So many questions. That should be solved now. And actually they are doing, the scientists. Scientists means they are also trying to solve so many problems. So that is, human being can be scientist. Not a dog can be scientist. So why not become the supreme scientist to know the Absolute Truth. That isVedānta-sūtra.Athātobrahmajijñāsā.Now you propose that ""Why don't you accept that life begins from life?"" What is their objection? This is also theory, and why not accept this theory? And now let us compare, which theory is feasible. Why you are afraid?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are silent.,Prabhupāda, Biased. Rascal bias.
Karandhara,They say life is also matter.,Prabhupāda," Life is matter, that's all right. But produce from matter life. That you cannot do. Life is also matter or we say, ""Matter is also life."" We say that.Sarvaṁkhalvidaṁbrahma.Brahmanmeans life. So everything is life. The basis of everything. Just like my body is depending on my life. Therefore the whole cosmic material manifestation is also depending on God. So matter is another energy of life. That we practically see. So in that sense we can say that matter is also life. That we can say. Or obversely, we can say, ""life is matter,"" that we can accept."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Matter is a part of life? Component.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like this nail is coming. This is matter. But it is coming from life. Because the body is in life, therefore the nail is coming, daily growing. Any child can understand. When this body is dead, no more nail will grow. Therefore this is matter coming from life. This body grows because the life is there. Life is there. If there is no life, the body will not grow. So it's natural conclusion, that matter grows upon life. And because life is the cause and matter is the effect, therefore as in the effect the cause is there... Just like cotton. Cotton is the cause and the thread is the effect. In the thread there is cotton. That is understood. Similarly, because life is the cause, matter is the effect, therefore in the effect there is life. In another form."
Karandhara,They say there is no difference between that life and that matter.,Prabhupāda," No, how can you say rascal? Then you are rascal immediately. There is so much difference. Then immediately you talk like rascal. There is difference. You have to accept superior, inferior. Just like two things. When you go to purchase something the shopkeeper gives you, ""Here is superior."" Although there is no difference, but there is difference of superiority and inferiority. That you have to accept. Therefore you pay more price to the superior. How there is no difference? This is another rascaldom. You have to distinguish between superior and inferior."
Karandhara,"Well, they say it is all made up of the same elements.",Prabhupāda," That is all right, but do why you pay more? That is difference. Question is difference. You have to accept difference. Why do you pay more for the superior thing? That is difference. Why do you pay more respect to a superior person? That is difference. Mr. Nixon is also a human being, you are also human being. But if Mr. Nixon immediately comes, we shall all pay him respect. Why? That is difference."
Karandhara,That's all on the same plane.,Prabhupāda," That's all not. That not all. He is the superior, He is getting respect. Therefore he is not equal to you. You cannot say that. You may say... A rascal may say that ""A superior person is as good as I am."" But people will not accept it. People will say, ""No, you are a rascal. He is an intelligent."" Although you have got two hands, he has got two hands, that doesn't matter. So you must distinguish between superior and inferior. We say it is one, but superior and inferior."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But in other words, the matter cannot grow without a living force.",Prabhupāda," No, that is another branch of, I mean to say, accepting matter as life. We have to distinguish them, that life is superior than matter. That we have to accept. You cannot say both of them are all the same. No. We have to distinguish them as superior, inferior."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"That is why the scientists, when they are trying to find out the origin of life, they are concerned only on the matter, the elements, chemical elements and the chemical compounds, the molecules, not on the superior energy.",Prabhupāda," No, there is superior energy. The same example. Just like because I am now living, I am eating something, going to the stomach, the chemical action is going on. If I am dead, it will not. Therefore life is superior. On account of presence of life, the foodstuff which we are taking, that is being divided into different chemicals, some urine, some stool, some blood, and they are being utilized differently. So how can you say? But without life, such distinction will not act. Therefore life is superior. Even accepting life is also matter."
Karandhara,They say there is no evidences that that life is eternal.,Prabhupāda," Life is eternal? That is another question. That we shall see. First of all, you accept that life is superior. Make solution one after another."
Karandhara,Well so long as they do not see that life as eternal or significantly different...,Prabhupāda," No eternal, that can be understood by any child. First you have to accept that life is superior."
Karandhara,That is just a conventional superiority. That superiority is just conventional or relative.,Prabhupāda," Why conventional? Actually. Just like a child and a teacher, they are of the same. He is also human being and children also, human being. But still, the children are controlled by the teacher. Therefore superior. It is not convention. If you disobey the superior, you will be punished. That superiority is explained in theBhagavad-gītā."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"It is explained nicely in today'sBhāgavataślokathat by the influence ofKṛṣṇa, the rivers are flowing filled with water, the trees are bearing fruits, flowers of the...",Prabhupāda," That's a fact. I have several times explained that in higher sense there is no matter. Did I not? So life and matter equal, that can be accepted, but there is superior and inferior position. Just likeKṛṣṇais life, I am also life.Kṛṣṇais also person, I am also person.Kṛṣṇahas got... WhatKṛṣṇa, propensities He has got, I have also got.Kṛṣṇawants to love another girl, so I want to love. A girl wants to love another boy, so Rādhārāṇī wants to loveKṛṣṇa. So everything qualitatively are all equal, butKṛṣṇacan marry at a time millions of wives. You cannot maintain even one wife. That is the position.Nityo nityānāṁcetanaḥ, Vedassay. That is the difference. He is life, I am also life. All the life symptoms, there is inKṛṣṇaand there is in me, but still I am inferior, He is superior. And that is the law, that the inferior should be subordinately serving to the superior. Therefore we want to..., our business is to serveKṛṣṇa, although qualitatively we are one. That inferior, superior, that is the difference between God and the living entity."
SvarūpaDāmodara,I am not clear about the life equal to matter.,Prabhupāda," Life equal to matter means the same thing. Just like here you pinch, you feel, but here with a, I mean to say, iron instrument you pinch, you will not feel. Both things are the same, is it not? But here you feel, here you do not feel. So matter means where there is less feeling, and life means where there is acute feeling. That is meaning."
SvarūpaDāmodara,I can understand that matter is a part of life.,Prabhupāda," This matter... You can understand by the finger. This matter, this nail, is production of this part. This part is life and this part is not life. But it is a production of this life. When you have cut your nails, you don't feel pain. But same instrument you touch your little, half inch down, immediately you feel pain. So therefore although qualitatively... This is also produced of matter, as produced of this part. But where there is feeling, that is spiritual, and where there is no feeling, that is matter. What isKṛṣṇaconsciousness? The human being is the same. But as soon as he feels that ""There isKṛṣṇa,"" he is spiritualist. As soon as he does not feel, he is materialist. That is the difference. It is the question of feeling. Matter means where there is absence ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. In other things there is also consciousness. Because there is notKṛṣṇaconsciousness, it is material. And so far we are concerned, we have got the same consciousness, butKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Therefore we are superior, spiritual. So this material world means this part, and spiritual world means this part. This is the difference. Here you have got feeling. So the conclusion is when you have feeling inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is spiritual, that is superior. When you have no feeling ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that is inferior. The same thing can be turned into superior and inferior by the change ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So matter can be converted to spirit.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Just like expert electrician, the same energy, electric, converting into heat, converting into refrigerator. The energy is the same. Both places the electricity is working, but by his expert management, one is heater, one is cooler. But heat and cool completely different, just opposite. That is stated in theViṣṇuPurāṇa.Parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate... [Cc.Madhya13.65, purport].Ah.Viṣṇu-śaktiḥparā.Both matter and spirit, they are energy of the Supreme. So the energy or the energetic—non-different. But by His arrangement, one is working as superior, one is working as inferior. The same example, that the same electric energy is acting as cooler and acting as heater. But the energy is the same. Similarly, originally the energy is God's energy. So God's energy and God, there is no difference. But by his manipulation one is working as material energy, another is working... This is difference. Therefore originally it comes all spiritual energy, life. Therefore we have to take everything from life, not from the dead. Same example: The finger is first coming, life, and then the nail is coming, matter. Not that first of all nail is coming. You can study. This is meditation."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So in any case, everything is controlled by the superior energy.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That superior energy is life. A small seed of banyan tree fructifies; there is life, and the big tree comes. So many wood, so many twigs, so many things, huge quantity. Here is the proof. Life is the origin. According to our Vedic description,Brahmāis first created. He is life. Not that matter is first created, thenBrahmācomes. No. AndBrahmācomes fromViṣṇu.Viṣṇuis life, the supreme life. ThenBrahmācreates this universe. That is Vedic version. What do you think?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, So life is the origin.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Life started from life. It cannot start from matter.,Prabhupāda," No. If you can establish this theory, you will get also Nobel Prize. Yes, try for... Yes, do it. And all these rascals will be defeated. Do that. Their so-called theory that life has come out of matter... Do this by your education.Yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.Here is life,Kṛṣṇa. Here begins everything.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavomattaḥsarvaṁpravartate[Bg.10.8].Kṛṣṇasays.Vedāntasays,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].Everything is there. Simply we have to present it scientifically. That's all. So you were the only person to protest against him in the meeting?"
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda.,Yes. Nobody asked any questions.; Blind leading the blind.,Prabhupāda," That's all.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].Anyway he has admitted, ""I do not know."" That is sufficient defeat for him. But they are shameless. In spite of being defeated, they won't admit that ""I am defeated."" Not gentlemen. Formerly between two learned scholars there will be argument. If one is defeated... Just likeSarvabhaumaBhaṭṭācārya. As soon as he became defeated, he became His disciple. That's all. That was the system. Not that we go on arguing for hours, and one is defeated; still, he remains the same. No. If you are defeated, then you must accept the other party as your master. That was the system. As soon as he said that I do not know, he should have become your disciple. That is the system. ""If you do not know why you have come to teach me."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,He should come and become a disciple of Śrīla Prabhupāda.,Prabhupāda," No, Prabhupāda... No. We want everyone to become Kṛṣṇa's disciple. That is our mission. We are disciplic succession. The original master isKṛṣṇa. (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,By logic.,Prabhupāda," By logic, by science. Anyway, that we have to make program. Because this is most misleading. The whole human society is affected by this misleading theory. We have to make program, go from place to place and invite all big men, all scientists. That program we have to make. We cannot allow this nonsense theory to go on. We must make something.Brahmānanda, how to make this? This is a fact, that, that life comes from life. In another sense life does not come. Life is existing. It is not exactly the word that life generates, no. Life is existing. The matter is generated. Matter is generating, and it stays for some time, again it is vanished. Just like this body. This body is born at a certain date, and it will be finished at a certain date. This is matter. [break] The wood was born at a certain date from the tree. It remains green for certain time. Then it is not green, dry. Then, after some time, it will be finished. Matter is not permanent. Matter is changing.Ṣaḍ-vikāra.Six kinds of changes, matter. Birth, then growing... Matter grows also. Just like the body has grown. It was very small, pea-like body in the beginning, and it grows. So birth, growth, maintenance for some time, then by-product. There are some by-products. And then dwindling, then finished. This is matter. But life has no such change. When the life is within the matter, it appears that it is taking birth or death. Life will come. One phase of this change, accept. And when it cannot be maintained anymore, just like this body, when it is too old it cannot maintain. Just like dress. When it is too old we change. So these things are there. The matter is... Life is existing. Life has no change. The change is outward, material thing. In all respects we have to prove that life does not come from matter. Matter generates from life, stays for some time, and it is finished. Again begins another chapter."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The original source is life.,Prabhupāda," Life, yes. They are searching after the original source. That is life,Kṛṣṇa,sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam[Bs.5.1],cause of all causes. So this is not theory; this is fact. Now we have to prove it. Then the whole program of these rascals' theory will be changed, and people will be happy. Because they are standing on a wrong theory, all their calculations are wrong, and people are suffering. The rascal Darwin's theory. So many, based on this foolish theory, wrong conception of life. So we have to challenge, protest. defeat. This will be our work. Our worshiping ofKṛṣṇa, that is our internal affair. The external affair—we need to establish this theory. Otherwise they'll be leading this society. Misleading. They are misleading, not leading, misleading. So we have to stop this misleading. Make program how to do it. Because it is truth, you will come triumphant. There is no doubt about it. It is truth. Now you have to know how to present the truth. That is your business. We are not presenting something theories, concocted by my brain. No. This is the fact. Rudimentarily we have got evidences, but it has to be presented by the modern ways. They are presenting some wrong principle by propaganda, and we cannot establish real principle by factual presentation? What is the difficulty?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, when we ask them, they say, ""I do not know.""",Prabhupāda," That is their position. They do not know. So immediately you have to challenge that rascal, ""If you do not know why you teach? What is the value of your teaching? If your position is 'do not,' then why you stand for teaching fact or truth?"""
SvarūpaDāmodara,At the present time there are no people to protest.,Prabhupāda," So we have to protest. Why we are. We have to protest and kick them on their face. That should be our position. If others are not protesting, why we shall sit down?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is why... Others are not protesting. That is why people are accepting.,Prabhupāda," So you protest, write in book. You are scientist. Write in book. Prove scientifically. That will be your laurel of taking the doctorate degree. If you also become one of these rascal doctors, then what is the use of yourKṛṣṇaconsciousness that whatever they say you silently accept? No. Just become Babhruvāhana, Manipur Babhruvāhana, that the fighting is faced. Take assistance, you have got. Ask Dr. Rao to come, join. Make plan. Go from town to town, all over the world. This has to be done. There was a poetry by Rabindranath Tagore. The purport of the poetry is that one who is mischievous, he is culprit. But one who tolerates mischievous activity, he is also culprit. If you are mischievous, you are criminal. But if you tolerate mischievous activities that is also criminal. Challenge these rascals. Stop their rascal theories. They have been described in theBhāgavataasśva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ[SB2.3.19].Saṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ.The so-called modern leader, he is apaśu,animal. And who exalts them?Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ:other lower animals like dogs, the hogs,śva-viḍ-varāha,camel and ass. So one big animal is being praised by these kinds of animals. So all the population withoutKṛṣṇaconsciousness, they have been described as dogs, hogs, camel and ass. So when they vote for another animal, big animal, so this is their position. They are big animal, praised by the dogs, hogs, camel and ass. They are not praised by any intelligent man. That is stated in theBhāgavata. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥsaṁstutaḥpuruṣaḥpaśuḥ.They are animals. These animals, they do not know the actual fact, and they are passing on as leaders, professors, scientists. Why they should be allowed? There must be some protest against these men. They have no real knowledge. They say, ""I do not know,"" and still, they are passing as poet, er, scientist laureate. Why this should be allowed? Think over this matter seriously. You cannot tolerate this misleading. People are innocent. It is our duty to become merciful upon them, to give them real knowledge. And these people are misleading. There must be strong protests against these rascals. You can immediately write one article in some paper that ""These rascals has earned, what is called prize, Nobel Prize, and he does not know."" Immediately write one article. ""His position is 'does not know, does not, do not, does not,' and he is getting this prize."" So they are also dogs, hogs, asses, and he's a big ass, that's all. I have explained this in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.Take help. They are creating also dogs, hogs, in university?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So why this should be tolerated? Don't be a doctor of chemist like one of them. Be really doctor of chemist. They must accept. This is the basic, I mean, platform of scientific knowledge.Antavantaimedehānityasyoktāḥśarīriṇaḥ[Bg.2.18].That is stated inBhagavad-gītā.What lesson you have taken fromBhagavad-gītā? Antavantaimedehā.""This material body is perishable,antavantaḥ.""Nityasyauktāḥśarīriṇaḥ:""But the life within this body, that isnitya,eternal."" This whole cosmic manifestation is like that, the big body, gigantic body ofViṣṇu, external energy, display of external energy. Make plan how to meet them, how to defeat them. Catch them on their throat. If they say, ""I do not know,"" then ""Why you have become professor? Why do you become professor? Why do you become scientist? If you do not know, you learn from me. You become my disciple. I'll teach you. You learn it scrutinizingly with all your knowledge. We shall teach you. Why you evade?"" Just the other professor, he does not like to come. Other scientist, he told?"
Brahmānanda,"The German scientist, he didn't want to come.",Prabhupāda, Why he avoids?
SvarūpaDāmodara,He was thinking carefully and decided that he cannot defend what he has in his mind.,Prabhupāda," We are not ordinary, the so-called swamis andsādhus.We are going to give to the world something which they forgot. I told this in London airport. Yes. That was published in the papers. They asked me, ""Why you have come to London?"" And ""Because to teach you something which you have forgotten."""
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda,Is it before Prabhupāda came here.; In London.,Prabhupāda," In London. Here also I told in New York, ""To make you intelligent. You are all fools and rascals."" Yes, they are fools and rascals because they do not know what he is. He is thinking, ""I am this body."" So anyone who is thinking, ""I am this body,"" he is an ass. That is stated in theBhāgavata.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13]."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is the basis that life started from matter. They are thinking that this is the body.,Prabhupāda," Therefore we have to make very strong propaganda against this theory. Otherwise if you sleep only and take doctorate title, what is the use? You have to fight against these rascals. Make your soldier's party and start fighting against these rascals. No more toleration. No more silence. What is that sound?"
Brahmānanda; SvarūpaDāmodara,"Oh, it's a power saw. They are going to cut the wood.; If we publish that the original source is life, then everybody has to accept it that the... Everybody has to acceptKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is our program. As soon as they agree, ""Yes, life is...,"" then they have to acceptKṛṣṇaautomatically.Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam[Bs.5.1].[break] Some of them are thinking that this is asaṅkīrtanaparty. We aresaṅkīrtanaparty, undoubtedly. But they may not think ""They are sentimentalists."" They must know that we are scientists. Everywhere is the direction. These high waves, this big Pacific Ocean, they are also carrying out the direction of that Supreme life. Just like this airplane is floating. Is it floating without any direction?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,There is direction.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So everything is working under direction. Why do the rascals say like that? The aeroplane is a big machine. It is flying, but under the direction of a small spiritual spark, the driver, pilot. How you can deny? So as the small spiritual spark can direct a so-called gigantic plane, similarly, the big spiritual spark is directing this whole cosmic manifest... What is the difficulty to understand? You cannot say that ""Without that spiritual spark, that airplane can be operated."" You cannot say. That is not possible. You prove that ""Without that spiritual small spark, this big 747 aeroplane will..."" You cannot prove that. Where is your proof? You have to put that small spiritual spark. First of all the pilot body. Now, within that body,Kṛṣṇasays,asmindehe, dehino 'sminyathādehekaumāraṁ,tathādehāntaram [Bg.2.13].There isdehinaḥ.There is a proprietor of this body. So that proprietor is 1/10,000th part of the tip of the hair, very, very, small, atomic. On account of that atomic spiritual energy, there is working. This isbarefact. That small atomic spiritual energy is within this body, and therefore the body is working, and therefore the plane is working. Where is the difficulty to understand? Now, this man thinks himself very stout and strong, but why he is stout and strong? On account of that small spiritual spark is there. As soon as the small spiritual spark is gone, stout and strong has no meaning. Immediately all the birds will come. Vultures will come and eat him, eat the body. Immediately."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When the spirit goes out, the other living entities are not afraid of anymore.",Prabhupāda," No. Means he is finished. He is finished. That prayer was Kuntī's. That ""If you go away, then where is... Everything will be finished. Now they are looking so nice."""
Brahmānanda,Oh. Similarly...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,...if the soul leaves the body...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Brahmānanda,It looks nice...,Prabhupāda," But as soon as gone, everything is finished. Why these rascals do not know? Why they cannot replace with chemicals to bring life again? Why these rascals are accepted, I do not know. If the matter is the cause of origin of life... Now one dead man, such a big man, such a Professor Einstein, big brain, he is dying. Put another chemical. Let him come back to life and work again. So why these rascals talk like this? You cannot protest? You should protest. Your protest will be accepted because our, they say that ""You are not scientist. We cannot talk with you."" That's all right. But here is a scientist. Talk with him. Where is your that material chemical by injecting which...? What do they say? What is wanting in the dead body that the body is dead?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,That they do not know.,Prabhupāda," Then there are so many things they do not know. Still, they are scientists? And they are passing on as leaders of the society. Everything is ""I do not know,"" and he is a leader, scientist. What is this? A child, and he is passing on as teacher."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Sometimes the problem is too serious. They take it just lightly.,Prabhupāda," That is another foolishness. The same thing, that the rabbits close the eyes. Yes. Monkeys. And when the monkeys face a tiger, immediately he closes his eyes and the tiger immediately attacks him. So it is like that. He cannot solve the problem—""All right, let it go on."" And that is the position. Because our real problem is death. Nobody wants to die. So the scientist cannot give any relief from death. They are talking simply superficially. They cannot give any relief from death. But my real problem is death. I do not wish to die. I do not wish to become old man. What scientists can help me? I do not wish to become diseased. What the scientist can help me? I do not wish to take birth. These things, they cannot do anything. Major problem they have set aside. And they are, what is called, jackal. Yes. There is a story of the jackal. He became the king of the forest."
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda,Hindi; That is Watergate affair.,Prabhupāda, Watergate?
Brahmānanda,It is called the Watergate scandal.,Prabhupāda," Oh, what is that Watergate?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, that was the place where the headquarters of the Democratic party were. It's called Watergate. And the big, big important men...",Prabhupāda, They were being bribed.
Brahmānanda,"Well, they went to put tape recorder devices so they know what the opposite party is doing.",Prabhupāda, Who is that?
Brahmānanda,The Republicans.,Prabhupāda," Oh, Republicans. Who is in power now?"
Brahmānanda,"Well, Nixon. He is Republican.",Prabhupāda, He is Republican.
Brahmānanda,"They haven't traced it to him yet, but all his chief aides, they have all been implicated. It was during the election.",Prabhupāda, Oh. So therefore they are defeated.
Brahmānanda,Yeah. They knew what the Democrats were doing.,Prabhupāda," Yes. This position is at the present moment, no honest man can become a government officer, everywhere. Unless he is a rogue, dishonest person, he cannot maintain his governmental position. Therefore no noble man is going to the government. But what you can do?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Politicians are the greatest cheaters.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Scoundrel. Some philosopher said that ""Politics is the last place of the scoundrel. That is their last resort."" In India we see same thing.Harernāma,harernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21].So design some means how to fight with these... (end)"
Brahmānanda,One police car is coming.,Prabhupāda, HareKṛṣṇa
Police,Good morning.,Prabhupāda, Good morning. That is police car?
Brahmānanda,"No, he's the engineer I think.",Prabhupāda," Harernāma,harernāma,harernāma[Cc. Ādi17.21].Sattvam...There is an Indian government slogan,sattvameva..."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Sattvamevajayate.,Prabhupāda," Ah. So this issattvaṁjayate. It must come out triumphant. We have to try for... How foolishly they are propagating a false theory, and amongst themselves self-complacent, getting prize, eulogization. What is this nonsense? Expose them. Bluffing. The bluffing should be exposed. What you are doing here?"
SvarūpaDāmodara; Śrutakīrti,What they are doing here?; I think they have been taking out those posts from the sand. A little dangerous.,Prabhupāda," Dangerous, why?"
Śrutakīrti,"When the water covers them, they can't be seen. Someone can get hurt on them.",Prabhupāda, So many dangers. [break] So there are no more talks in your...
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Oh, there is a talk coming next week. There is a lecturer coming next week. He's slightly connected with evolution. He's a Nobel Prize winner. He's from Berkeley. He's coming next week, next Wednesday. He is going to give two lectures in our department. He is going to talk on evolution. The first lecture.",Prabhupāda, Darwin.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda; SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, evolution in general. And second lecture is on cancer, the causes of cancer disease.; Do they know the cause of cancer?; Oh, there are several theories. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," Suppose he knows the cause of cancer. What is the benefit? Neither he can stop cancer, neither a man suffering from cancer, if it is cured, he will live forever. That is not possible. Cancer or no cancer, a man has to die. He cannot check death. The death may be caused, if not cancer, simply by accident you can die. The real scientific research should be how to stop death. That is real scientific. That we are giving. To find out some medicine for some disease, that is not triumph. Real triumph is how to stop disease. That they cannot. ThereforeBhagavad-gītāputs before you the real trouble is this birth, death, old age and disease. That process we are giving.Tyaktvādehaṁpunarjanmanaitimāmetikaunteya[Bg.4.9]. After giving up this body, no more acceptance of material body. This is real science. [break] ...suffer from cancer. (laughter) They don't suffer from cancer. So they are in better position than the so-called human society. They are creating causes of cancer disease and then making research and taking Nobel Prize. How foolish society it is, this. Why you create the cause of cancer disease? You accept these four principles of life—no meat-eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex—there will be no cancer. There will be no cancer. You find out, those who are strictly on this line, they never suffer from cancer or any disease. Now take for example, me. I have come here in this country for the last seven years, 1965, and it is 1973, eight years. How many times I have gone to doctor? That once that heart attack. That is serious; that is another thing. Otherwise generally how many times I have gone to? I don't pay any bill of doctors. So if we live very hygienic life, regulated life, there is no question of cancer or any disease."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The disease is created...,Prabhupāda," Yes, they create. By violating the nature's law, disease is created."
Brahmānanda,Their whole idea is that they want to violate the law but not suffer for it. That is the whole basis of their research work.,Prabhupāda," But actually they suffer. Actually they suffer. Now, what is this research work? This is suffering, spending so much hard-earned money. So one of the cause of, I can say, one of the cause of cancer disease is this contraceptive method. You can make research on it. This is very dangerous stipulation, to use contraceptives. So they are, one side, discovering contraceptive medicine, contraceptive chemical; another side researching for cancer disease. And they say also that smoking is also one of the causes, smoking. So why do you not give up smoking? Smoking, illicit sex, contraceptive method."
Brahmānanda,From the meat-eating comes the heart disease.,Prabhupāda, From meat-eating?
Brahmānanda,Yeah.,Prabhupāda, Just see. (pause)
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, the material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. So we have different variegatedness in the material world, different living entities, plants, animals.",Prabhupāda," Without the inconvenience. Mean, in the material world there are so many inconveniences. So spiritual world, there is no inconvenience. Inebriety. It is a reflection of the spiritual world, but there are so many difficulties here. Therefore it is called material world."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, my question being, so they have all the variegatedness in the spiritual world?",Prabhupāda," Yes there are trees, there are water, birds, beasts, but they are all spiritual. Just like here everything is material. Here water is working according to the material laws. In the spiritual world if I say, ""Please come here,"" he will come here. That is spiritual world."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So the difference is that the spiritual...,Prabhupāda," Everything spiritual... As here everything is material, there everything is spiritual. Now try to understand what is matter, what is spirit. Spirit, as I was explaining yesterday, the spirit is the conductor, operator, of the aeroplane. So matter is working under the guidance of spirit. So there everything being spirit, there is no necessity of another spiritual guidance."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So we have in this material world we have the evolution.,Prabhupāda," No, there is no evolution because there is no birth."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, in the material world.",Prabhupāda," Material world, there is evolution because there is birth. But in the spiritual world there is no birth. Birth, death, old age, disease, these things are not there. There is no question of evolution. Evolution means to transmigrate from one body to another. But there is no such thing. Everyone is eternal. There is no death, there is no transmigration. This is botheration. Therefore spiritual world means all the varieties of the material world, less botheration, minus botheration."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But in theVaikuṇṭhaplanets...,Prabhupāda," Just likeKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇahad so many girlfriends. There are so many nice descriptions of embracing, kissing, but there is no pregnancy or abortion. There is no description of such things. And that is spiritual world. The attraction for young boy, young girl is there also. They are also enjoying their company. Everything is there. But there is no such thing as pregnancy and abortion. Here people do not want that, pregnancy and abortion. But they are forced to do it because there are so many inebrieties here. That thing is minus in the spiritual world. They are also attracted by the bodily features of the women. There is attraction, but they are more attracted by chantingHareKṛṣṇamantra.Therefore this bodily attraction of woman does not affect them. Just like if you have got better attraction, you don't care for the lower attraction. The attractions are there. The body of the woman is very beautiful. But men are not so much attracted with the body of the woman. They are more attracted toHareKṛṣṇamantra.These are described in theBhāgavata. Here also, practically we see, those who are attracted by theHareKṛṣṇamantra,they are not very much attracted with the bodily features of the women. Is it not?"
Brahmānanda,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So attraction is there, but better attraction. Life is there, better life. Everything better, superior. Superior energy."
Brahmānanda,"You've, said that our society ISKCON is like a sample of the spiritual world.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Brahmānanda,We develop our attraction forHareKṛṣṇa; we lose our attraction for sex life.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Bhaktiḥpareśānubhavoviraktiḥ... That is the sign of advancement ofbhakti. If you don't be... I was explaining this. If you don't be detached to these material things, then you should know that you are not advancing in spiritual life. If you have got still attachment for these nonsense material things, that means you are not advanced. Just like if you are eating, and if you are not getting health, that means you are eating nonsense. Eating must result in good health. That is eating. Eating does not mean to fill up the belly with all rubbish things. Eating means that you become healthy, nice eating."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Understanding that in the spiritual world... In theVaikuṇṭhaplanets, we get that all the inhabitants are four-handed forms ofNārāyaṇa?",Prabhupāda," Yes, exactly likeNārāyaṇa. Their bodily features... Just like here, you cannot distinguish by the bodily feature who is President Nixon, who is a common man. You cannot distinguish by the bodily feature. Similarly, there also, you cannot distinguish who is a common man and who is Personality of Godhead. They are like that."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But still, there are plants and all the living entities in theVaikuṇṭha...",Prabhupāda," They know. Because they have full knowledge, ""He knows here is God. Although he is four-handed, I am four-handed, but here is God."" Because there is full knowledge. That is the difference. Here we are selecting some rascal as God, because we have no full knowledge. There, in theVaikuṇṭhaplanets, although the common citizens and God is of the same feature of the bodily, but they know, ""Here is God, the Supreme."" He has got special signs in the... Yes, that's all. Just like the king or the president, we may make mistake. We may accept somebody as ""Here is president."" No. But the associates of the president, he knows. They know that ""Here is president."" Similarly, there is no question of mistake there. Four kinds of defects of material life—to commit mistake, to become illusioned, to cheat, and imperfection of the senses—these things are not there. Everyone's senses are perfect. When he sees God, he sees perfectly. He does not mistake. He is not illusioned. And there is no cheating and there is no imperfection of the senses. There is no mistake. These are spiritual life."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So all the living entities are completely satisfied.,Prabhupāda," Certainly. Because they are in the spiritual life. That is real life. Here it is covered. There is no such season as winter season, as summer season. Always spring.Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt(Vedānta-sūtra1.1.12),simplyānanda, blissful life of knowledge. What do they know, the scientists, about the spiritual life?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"There is no...,",Prabhupāda," No information, no research. Thatkūpa-maṇḍūka, this frog in the well. That's all. They have no information of the Pacific Ocean. They are researching within the well. That's all. They have no information even of this material world. What do they know about the so many planets, so many, huge outer space? What do they know?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Almost nothing.,Prabhupāda," Nothing. Not even of this planet, what to speak of other planets. And still, they are proud. ""Nobel Prize."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"If they know that there is definitely a blissful world, spiritual world, they would not work this hard.",Prabhupāda," Yes, why? Just like LomaśaMuni. LomaśaMuni, his duration of life is that when oneBrahmādies, one hair from the body falls. So in this way, when all the hairs of his body will fall down, he will die. He has such a great length of... So he was standing on the side of a sea and chantingHareKṛṣṇa. SoNāradaMuniapproached him, ""Why don't you make a small cottage here?"" He said, ""How long I shall live? (laughter) Ah, standing will do. Let me finish my bead...(?)"" Just see. And here they'll live for twenty years and making skyscraper building, (makes sound:) ""Doc, dong, doc, dong, doc, dong."" (laughter) Does not calculate that ""I shall live for twenty or thirty years."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is not guaranteed also.,Prabhupāda," That is also not guaranteed. Why I am taking so much trouble? They are so foolish persons. Therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says,anityasaṁsāremohajanamiyā jīvakekarayegādhā. This so-called scientific education means people become more attracted with this temporary world and he works very hard, just like an ass. Ass, the example of ass is because the ass does not know what is his interest, but works very hard. Therefore ass example is given. Ass, he carries the washerman's cloth, tons, but not a single cloth belongs to him. He is naked. And still he is working. He does not know, ""Why I am working for the washerman, carrying so much load?"" That sense he hasn't got. He thinks that ""Washerman gives me to eat some grasses."" Although grasses are all over. That is ass. That is ass. So these scientific research workers, they are asses. He does not know that ""I shall live for thirty years. So what is the use of my research work?"" But intelligent man will say, ""Let me utilize this thirty years to prepare for my next life."" That is intelligence. But they. But they have no idea of the next life. (pause) Again, Switzerland."
SvarūpaDāmodara,London is also like this.,Prabhupāda," Yes, London, yes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The smell we are getting now from burning the gas or coal is also one of the causes of cancer. The hydro-carbons.,Prabhupāda," Yes, the artificial life is the cause of all diseases. And they won't accept our natural life. That they think primitive, ""We must advance."" What is your advancement? Primitive life was also subjected to death. You are also subjected to death. So where is your advancement?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Advancement in decorating the dead body.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes, yes. Decorating a dead body, yes. So this is another foolishness. (loud sound of a chain-saw in the background) First of all they pin all these logs. Now they are cutting.Punaḥpunaścarvita-carvaṇānām[SB7.5.30], chewing the chewed. And millions of dollars will be spent for this purpose."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They have so many plans, one after another. Never stop.",Prabhupāda, Restlessness. Not fixed up. What they are doing here?
Brahmānanda; SvarūpaDāmodara,"They want to break these posts todigthis hole.; This is a very big..., quite deep. I think they are digging so they can take this out. This is called technological advancement. (laughter)",Prabhupāda," Yes, to work foolishly. [break] 6:37. Is that all right? What is your time?"
Brahmānanda,6:34.,Prabhupāda," Oh, little slow."
SvarūpaDāmodara,I am writing a letter toRāmānandaPrabhu...,Prabhupāda," Yes, come and join. Let us do some service toKṛṣṇa. What is the value of our education? Earning money, that also ordinary porter also... They are also earning more than that, than scientists, these men?"
Brahmānanda,Oh yeah.,Prabhupāda, What do they charge per day?
SvarūpaDāmodara; Brahmānanda,"They are getting much more than the normal scientist because manual labor is very expensive here.; About seven, eight dollars an hour or something like that?",Prabhupāda, And they work for how many hours?
Brahmānanda; Devotee,"Eight hours. So fifty-six dollars, or fifty dollars per day. Who can earn, the scientists, fifty dollars?; The brick-layers get a hundred dollars a day.",Prabhupāda," Just see. So why don't you become a brick layer instead of scientist? (laughter) You get more money. Dr. Bose, he called me... I told you. He asked me, ""What you are doing?"" ""Now, I am going to the share market."" So he immediately said, ""Then what is the value of your education if you are going to the share market like the Marwaris who are illiterate?"" Share market means to have some tricks how to sell and purchase shares. That by practicing anyone can do. It is not very difficult. [break] ... life from life. Make vigorous propaganda. Let them come to argument, scientific discussion. (pause) The man and woman in your country, they have got equal rights. Why not here? (laughter) In the lavatory? Why this discrimination, ""woman,"" ""man,"" why? Equal rights, must be equal rights. (pause) What is the basic philosophy for contraceptive action? Why do they prefer contraceptive method?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Their point being to reduce the population, not to increase.",Prabhupāda," But population is reducing, it is increasing. You take the statistics, the world population is increasing, it is not decreasing."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"It is increasing, but not as fast as the...",Prabhupāda," Anyway it is increasing; it is not decreasing. And besides that, there is no such restriction among the birds and beasts. How you can make more for... A cat, a dog, a hog, this birth—one dozen children at a time. And twice in a year. So increasing population is more there, they have got more capacity. So they are not fasting."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are saying that because of our medical science, the number of deaths are decreasing. The number of births are increasing and death the rate is decreasing because of medical science.",Prabhupāda," Due to medical science, death is...?"
Brahmānanda,Decreasing. People are living longer.,Prabhupāda," It is all nonsense. Who lives now hundred years. Thirty, forty, fifty, finished. It is another nonsense. At the present age, does anybody live like his grandfather? No. No. That's not a fact. At the present moment the maximum years-eighty years. Formerly they were living a hundred years. My grandmother lived for ninety-six years."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They take a statistical average, they call. That means the average number of people living now, they have longer lives, on the average.",Prabhupāda, Average duration of life in India is thirty years. Thirty years. It has decreased. (end)
SvarūpaDāmodara,"It was raining a little bit when I came, in the south, towards Laguna Beach, it was raining. And when I came this side, it was very clear.",Prabhupāda," You approach the United Nations also. What they are doing? Simply wasting money. What is their aim and object, United Nations?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Peaceful co-existence, cooperation among different nations.",Prabhupāda, So what they have done so far?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Nothing.,Prabhupāda, Just see.
Brahmānanda,Many speeches.,Prabhupāda," Peaceful co-existence is this,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Brahmānanda; Śrutakīrti,They did not do anything. These posts are still here.; They are finding it very difficult. (pause),Prabhupāda, What they are doing there? Something aimless. (some noise of people yelling a distance away) [break] ...because frogs never come to the... You will never find a frog in the ocean. Did you mark it?
Brahmānanda,No.,Prabhupāda, You have got so many animals but never a frog.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Maybe they don't like the salt.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, frog is conspicuous by absence. There is no frog. Therefore that example is given. They have never seen what is the ocean. (laughs) So all these scientists, they are frogs. They have never seen what is the kingdom of God. Therefore this example, ""Doctor Frog."" Doctor frog is never visible in the ocean. They are visible only within this circle, well. That's all."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"This example is available inBhāgavatam,Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Yes, innyāya-śāstra.Kūpa-maṇḍūka-nyāya.Kūpameans well, andmaṇḍūkameans frog. ""The frog in the well."" The frogs, sometimes they are in river also, in bank of the rivers. But never in the ocean."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The environment is not suitable. They are fresh water species.,Prabhupāda," Well, they are also aquatics. They also live in water. But they are unfit for living in ocean water. So many varieties of life, different living entities meant for different purposes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,According to the desire of the...,Prabhupāda," According to the desire of the living entity. All facilities, whatever you want, you can have.Harernāmaharernāmaharernāmaevakevalam[Cc. Ādi17.21].Another logic isbakāṇḍa-nyāya. Bakāṇḍa.Bakaandaṇḍa.Baka,the duck. Andaṇḍa,the testicle, testicle of the bull. The bull is going and the testicle is hanging, and the duck is after it. He is thinking here is a fish. You find him always going...when it will drop.Bakāṇḍa.This is nature's study. [break] Thebaka,the duck, they are after fish. So the testicle is hanging, he's thinking it's a big fish, it will drop now. So it will never drop but he is going after it. Just see. Neither it is fish. Another logic isāja-gala-stana,āja-gala-stana.You have seen on the goats in the neck, just like nipples. If one is expecting milk from that nipple, he is also fool. It is not nipple but it looks like nipple.Āja-gala-stana-nyāya."
SvarūpaDāmodara,It is like the mirage in the desert.,Prabhupāda," Yes, illusion, these are illusions.Āja-gala-stana-nyāyais applied for these rascals, those who are thinking that from matter life is coming. Exactly the same. They are thinking that here are nipples, there will milk come. Let us milk here."
Brahmānanda,"But they are not getting, they are saying maybe in the future.",Prabhupāda," Yes, in future, yes. (laughter) In Sanskrit logic all these examples are there from nature's study."
Brahmānanda,Simple.,Prabhupāda," Simple, yes. Another isnagna-mātṛkā-nyāya.Nagna-mātṛkā-nyāya,just like sometimes if somebody says, ""Mother, when you were a child, you were naked. Why do you put cloth now?""Nagna-mātṛkā-nyāya.The mother was naked when she was a child. Therefore she should remain naked still. That isnagna-mātṛkā-nyāya."
Brahmānanda,What is that in connection?,Prabhupāda," It has connection, if somebody was not very important and now he has become important, so the logic is how this man can be important? This logic. That because the mother was naked in the childhood, therefore she should not put on any garment. This isnagna-mātṛkā-nyāya.We change according to the circumstances. You cannot say that this must remain like this."
SvarūpaDāmodara,It is also not because of the development of consciousness.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, yes. Everything is development of consciousness. So when one comes toKṛṣṇaconsciousness that is perfect. Consciousness is there even in the tree, but that is not developed. When you cut the tree, it feels. Even a child their consciousness is not developed. Sometimes operation in the body of a child does not require anaesthetic, because they do not feel much. Can go on surgical operation on the child's body and they will feel little. Because the consciousness is not developed."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So according to the consciousness...,Prabhupāda, Development.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When a person becomes very old, he should be very intelligent.",Prabhupāda," No no. It is a question of consciousness of the body. That does not mean when a dog becomes very old he becomes very experienced. No. Consciousness according to the body. The same theory. Because a child's body is not developed, the consciousness is also not developed.HareKṛṣṇa. And these rascals say that because the consciousness is not developed, he has no soul. Soul is there even within the tree. But because the consciousness is not developed, the sensation is less."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But still the consciousness in a particular species is developing.,Prabhupāda, Everywhere is developing consciousness. And the topmost development isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But the modern science, they say when one becomes old, the memory becomes short and then they tend to...",Prabhupāda," Yes. The body has changed. Therefore you have to accept that body has changed. Therefore next conclusion is when this body is lost he gets another body. Change of body. Seasonal changes. That one verse in theBhagavad-gītā,tathādehāntara-prāptir dhīrastatranamuhyati[Bg.2.13].Dehāntara-prāptiḥ,acceptance of another body. Then these modern scientists, they do not know this. They sometimes explain medical science, that blood corpuscles are changing, do they not?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"There are sometimes white, they say, suppose when I am injured, my external something hurts. They say the white blood corpuscles are responsible to protect the body. But when the white blood corpuscles is not enough, then infection normally occurs.",Prabhupāda," Anyway there is change of corpuscles. And with the change of corpuscles there is change of body. That is scientific. Therefore body is changing every moment, so why not after death?Tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13]."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So consciousness is also subject to body's changes, change of body.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Body's circumstances association.Saṅgātsañjāyatekāmaḥ.According to association, atmosphere, circumstances, the desires changes. So that is, desire means consciousness. Just like our boys, they had different consciousness before coming toKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Just like you are also scientist, there are other scientists. But your consciousness is different from theirs. Therefore you could challenge him like that. If you can create life by accumulation of these facts. He says that I do not know. He is not confident in his science."
SvarūpaDāmodara,He is not experienced. He has not seen yet.,Prabhupāda," He is not above the defects, four defects of conditioned life. You know these four defects?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Illusion, mistake, cheating, imperfectness. They are aware of the imperfectness of the senses. Still they are proud of their knowledge. This is illusion. (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was going to ask is there any difference betweenacintya-śaktiand mysticyogapower?",Prabhupāda, They call it mystic.
SvarūpaDāmodara,The same?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Mystic yogic power means the sameacintya-śakti,dormant potency which is within everyone. That can be awakened. The same example, as I have given, that everyone has got the potency to swim, but it has to be practiced. I cannot swim. For me, if one is swimming, it is inconceivable power. But I have got also that power. By practice, it has to be awakened."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is a yogic process.,Prabhupāda," That is yogic process. Real yogic process is to find outParamātmā, but side by side many other dormant powers become awakened. Another example, that tree is producing chemicals. So every living entity has got dormant potencies, more or less. So God,Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme living entity; therefore He has the full potency. God means full, complete.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).The best living entity, that is God. (pause) Is there any difficulty to understand the best living entity?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,The best living entity?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,No.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So that best living entity is God.Īśvaraḥparamaḥkṛṣṇaḥ[Bs. 5.1].That means the best controller, the supreme controller. Just like this man is controlling his dog, and that man is controlled by somebody else. In his office or where he works, he is controlled by his boss. And the dog is controlling the cat, the cat is controllingrat. In this way, one after another, there are controllers. I control you, he controls me, another controls him. In this way, you go on searching. When you find out somebody who controls but is not controlled by anyone, He is God. Where is the difficulty to understand? Everyone here we see that although a person is controller, at the same time he is controlled. Therefore the ideal living entity is, he controls but he is not controlled by others. That is supreme."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So the supreme living entity...,Prabhupāda," He is God. He is living entity,nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).That is the Vedic version."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So he doesn't have to practice yogic power.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because He is most perfect, He hasn't got to practice. Just like the fish hasn't got to practice how to live within the water, natural.Svābhāvikī.It is calledsvābhāvikī.Svābhāvikīmeans by nature. If I want to fly in the sky, I will have to find out... Just like these boys are struggling with the waves with precaution, with so much practice, but a small fish, he doesn't care for big, big waves; it will go against. So that small fish is more powerful than you in that respect. You are struggling against the waves, but the small fish goes against the waves without any difficulty. A small teeny... So many things. There are many superiors than you. The most superior is God. That's all. That is the definition of God. You won't find anybody superior than Him.Mattaḥparataraṁnānyat [Bg.7.7].There is no more any superior. That is God."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When the living entity comes to the human platform, though he is conditioned, but still, by practice ofyogahe can develop...",Prabhupāda, Some of the powers.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"...which cannot be developed by other living entities, like for example, fish.",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. That distinction is there between one living entity and another. You have got some power, others have got another power. That'stara-tama,means comparative and superlative... That is calledtara-tama.(pause) There are varieties of potencies. All these potencies are visible, some in you, some in me, some in others. But all the varieties in full potency is in God. That is God. Not like this rascal incarnation of God. What is that, they came? Bālajī?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,GuruMahārāja?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Not that. (laughs) ThatKṛṣṇawas requested by His teacher that, when He was offering that ""Now I am going home. What shall I present to you,guru-dakṣiṇā,giving to theguru?"" So he requested, ""Kṛṣṇa, I have heard that You are so powerful. I lost my two sons. If you bring them..."" SoKṛṣṇaimmediately went and brought them from within the ocean. This is God. Similarly,Devakīalso requestedKṛṣṇathat ""Kṛṣṇa, before Your birth I lost seven children. Your maternal uncle killed them. So I want... I have heard that You have returned back the sons of Your teacher. Why not my sons?"" So He brought them. That isKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇawent to KāraṇārṇavaśāyīViṣṇu, penetrating the covering of this universe.Arjunaalso went with Him. You know that?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,No.Kṛṣṇa...?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇawent outside this universe, penetrating the sky. AndArjunaalso accompanied Him. So it is Kṛṣṇa's power, He took His friend also. For ordinary human being it is not possible. But becauseKṛṣṇasaid that ""All right, I'll take you."" So He took him. This covering, universal covering, there are seven layers: earth, water, fire, air... Each layer is ten times bigger than the one layer. Then you go to the spiritual world."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Ten times bigger than each layer, it increases?",Prabhupāda," That one layer, the other layer is ten times bigger than the first layer, and the third are ten times bigger than that, ten times. In this way the whole universe is covered. What your scientists know? (laughs)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Scientists say that there are different layers in the atmosphere. There is ionosphere and all those spheres.,Prabhupāda," So anyway, some ideas are there. But inBhāgavatait is all written."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But they do not say that ten times.,Prabhupāda, What do they know? They do not know anything. Know something. (pause)
SvarūpaDāmodara,So when we establish the theory ofacintya-śakti...,Prabhupāda," Not onlyacintya-śakti.First of all you have to establish that life is not from matter. Matter is from life. Then they will be under your control. First of all you have to establish. Because their whole scientific advancement is going on on this basis, that life is from matter. But that is not the fact. Matter is from life, just the opposite. First of all you have to establish this. Why don't you write a theory and get Nobel Prize? This is a fact. Now you have to prove only, by their scientific words. That's all. Fact is this is. Are you convinced about this fact, that matter comes from life, not life comes from matter? Are you convinced or not? Otherwise how you can write?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, I am convinced.",Prabhupāda," Then why don't you write in scientific language. All these material elements have come from life. Not that from material elements, life has come. No. That is not the fact.Kṛṣṇasaysmattaḥsarvaṁpravartate,""Everything from Me."" ButKṛṣṇais life.Ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavaḥ[Bg.10.8], janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1].So... Andbhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥ,bhinnāme prakṛtiraṣṭadhā[Bg.7.4].So many informations are there. Me, ""Mine,"" ""I am,"" like that. So He is life. Our God is not dead. Our God is life, living, just like us, one of us. But He is more powerful. That's it. Our God eats, sleeps, like us, just like we eat, sleep. The difference is that He eats, but He keeps the thing as it is."
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,"Oṁpūrṇamadaḥpūrṇamidam[Īśopaniṣad,Invocation].",Prabhupāda," Yes. And we eat, we finish. And we cannot again produce. God's power is like that, that He eats, at the same, keeps everything intact for your eating. And I, if you give me a plate, I eat and there is nothing for you. That is difference. He also eats. Otherwise we are making all these bogus things, preparing so many nice things, offering to God? Is that false?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,No.,Prabhupāda," No.Pūrṇasyapūrṇamādāyapūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate [IsoInvocation].He is so complete that one minus one equal to one. That is Absolute. ThereforeKṛṣṇais expanding Himself by so many energies, butKṛṣṇais the same. There is no loss in His energy. Even in a human being or animal, he produces so many children. Just like hog—he produces at least one dozen children every year, but the hog is the same. If a hog can have so much power... And formerly one man used to produce hundreds of children. Wherefrom the potency comes? If a man is giving birth to hundreds of children, but still, he is the same man, wherefrom the potency comes? Why man? Even the fish, thousands of eggs they produce, and thousands of fishes are again produced. Wherefrom the potency comes?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,From the supreme controller.,Prabhupāda," Not supreme... He has got. From the supreme control..., yes, but directly we see that He has got so much potency. Everything is coming from Supreme; that's a fact. But you can see hundreds and thousands of children produced by one single living entity. The snakes, they produce hundreds and thousands of children at a time. Fortunately, they eat their own children. Otherwise, the whole world would have been full of snakes only."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They eat?,Prabhupāda," Yes. All animals, they eat their children."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"I have seen the eggs of snakes. They are small, this big, the eggs.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,"As theKali-yugaadvances, the human beings will eat their children too. Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Just like in the last war, they ate stool, their own stool, out of hunger. So when there will be no foodstuff, they will kill their own children. Already they are killing, abortion. Not only abortion, children grows... By surgical instrument, they kill and they take out the child... They are already killing."
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,"When they take the pill, the birth control pill, are they killing their children too?",Prabhupāda," Killing means killing, what is that? What he is asking? I do not..."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"He is asking that they take the pill, birth control pill.",Prabhupāda," No, no, that is one kind of killing. But directly killing. They, through some instrument, through the vagina, they kill, cut into pieces and get out. Living children. He is a scientist. That surgeon, he is a scientist, and doing this business."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes, medical scientist.",Prabhupāda, Just see. He is paid for that killing.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They lost the mercifulness, the quality...",Prabhupāda," What merciful? Animal has mercifulness. They are animals only. This modern civilization is producing animals. That's it. Who was speaking that slaughterhouse they are giving some injection that the animal may not feel pain? Rascal, he is killing him, and he is humanitarian work, he may not feel killed. If I say, ""I shall kill you, but you will not feel any pain. Come on."" This is their philosophy. They are killing, and they are saying, ""Oh, may not be feeling any pain."" Such rascaldom is going on. I therefore do not talk with any rascal except my disciples. I know they are all rascals. Waste of time. All this rascaldom is coming out of that wrong notion that life is from matter, that wrong notion."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"That is why they say, ""So long as I am alive, enjoy as much as you can.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is their philosophy. Hedonism."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"If they know that there is life after death or life started from life, then they would not be doing like this.",Prabhupāda, So many things you will change. (pause) And that is mystic power for me.
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,Surfing?,Prabhupāda," Yes, because I do not know how to do it. Therefore it is mystic power. But the boy is going like this. (pause) Just like one of the yogīs, she (he) walked over the river, crossed. So another old man said: ""Oh this is only twopaisāworth."" Why? ""I will pay twopaisāto this boatman. He will cross me there."" But to attain that power, he had to spend so many years for practicing. This is waste of time. If you can do it by paying twopaisāor oneānāto a boatman to cross the river, why should you for ten years or fifteen years practice thisyoga, just to show a magic?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Prabhupāda, I remember an incident in Bombay. That was when I was in Calcutta about, a few years ago. There was ayogī. There was advertisement that he was going to walk on water.",Prabhupāda," No, that is possible."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So I think it was about five hundred rupees per ticket.,Prabhupāda," Oh, just see. His real aim was to get some money."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Radhakrishnan was there, the president. But ultimately, he could not walk. He fell down in the water.",Prabhupāda, And what about the money?
SvarūpaDāmodara,I don't know. He was beaten or something. They said he missed something.,Prabhupāda," That's like you, chemist, just missing something, ""In future we shall do it."" It is the same thing. And these fools, Dr. Radhakrishnan and company, they are so fools that so many animals they are walking on the sea, ""I am going to see another man."" Just see, how they are fools. What is their credit? The sea lark. They call sea lark? They go very nicely. Why do they not see that? He is animal, he is, another is an animal."
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,Birds can float and they can fly.,Prabhupāda, Yes. So Dr. Radhakrishnan was a big rascal.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But I could not believe by that time. I said, ""It cannot be possible.""",Prabhupāda," No, it is possible. It is possible. If one has practicedyogasystem, He can become light. To walk over the water means to become very light, like cotton swab. Then he can walk. He can fly also. InSiddha-lokas, the inhabitants there, they fly in the sky. From one planet to another planet they go by flying. There isSiddha-lokaplanet. Therefore they are calledSiddha-loka, means they have all perfection of this yogic mystic power."
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,"AreSiddha-lokas like angels, Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda," Angels, you can call, they are angels. But there are human beings who fly. In your side, Kāmakaḥ (?), there are some ladies who fly in the sky on a tree. You have not heard?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,I very vaguely have heard.,Prabhupāda, Yes. There are. They can fly in the sky on a tree.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When I was a child, our grandfathers used to tell those things. So I would...",Prabhupāda," No, it is a fact. That is mentioned inBhāgavataalso, that... Whose daughter? She dreamed of a nice husband. So her friend,"
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,Uṣā.,Prabhupāda," Ah,Uṣā,Uṣā, yes. SoAniruddha. That friend broughtAniruddha, Kṛṣṇa's son. She dreamtAniruddha. So she promised, ""I am bringing you just picture, which picture do you like?"""
Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī,Citralekhā.,Prabhupāda," Citralekhā. Yes, he remembers. (pause)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"There is an experiment that was done by Pasteur, a French scientist a long time ago. In that experiment he boiled some, I think it was water. Because normally the water, without boiling there are so many microorganisms, small, small living entities, that can be detected under microscope. He wanted to know whether life started from some ingredients inside or just life started from life. So he boiled this solution and he kept for some time under very careful covering so that there is no contamination from outside. And then there was no life. He couldn't find any organisms. So they said, ""Life starts from matter."" That is one of the experiments.",Prabhupāda, What is that experiment?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Boil water first of all. Without boiling water, they can detect so many organisms, small, small bacteria and these small, small living entities under microscope. But when they would boil it and it kept for some time, and then they tested, there was no organisms.",Prabhupāda," But that microscope is imperfect. That is our contention. Because the living entities, the dimension of the living entity is 1/10,000th part of the top of your hair. So what you can see?"
Karandhara,"Also, they make the condition unsuitable for the spirit soul to occupy. Just like if we take and kill all these bodies and put them somewhere, and come back in a week, it's not that life will come back to the bodies. They make the circumstances unsuitable for the spirit soul.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is another explanation. It takes time. Besides that, according toBhagavad-gītā,life is not killed by fire.Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam.You have not read it?Adāhyaḥ:""It cannot be burnt into fire."" So how life can be killed by boiling water? That is their nonsense."
Karandhara,"As soon the bodies become unsuitable, so the spirit soul leaves.",Prabhupāda, Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam.Adāhyaḥ.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But by putting proper chemicals, then they can see again. The ingredients necessary for the survival of the living entities, the necessary amounts, like source of protein, source of carbon, then the life is again started.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Wherefrom the life came?
Karandhara; Kṛṣṇa-Kāntī; Karandhara,"It's not started. It becomes suitable again for the spirit soul. So they come.; They're just changing the living conditions.; Like if you put honey, ants will come.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That is good example. That does not mean the honey is producing ants. If life is coming from matter then why you are putting chemicals? That is also matter. Life will come.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They say, without the chemicals, they cannot see life.",Prabhupāda," The chemical is also matter. Just like with one matter you make... Just like we mix so many matters. Turmeric, salt, spices, they are all matter. But mixing together, the condition is that it becomes a sweet vegetable. Similarly, the chemical is also matter. And water is also matter. So if life comes from matter, then it will come from the water. Why...? There is no use of mixing another chemicals? And it will actually be: Then let the water remain for some time. When it will decompose, the life will come. The stagnant water, life will come. Just like in the ocean, there are so many lives are coming out. Who is going to put the chemical? Nonsense. Where you have got so much chemical? And you can find out tons and tons, millions of tons of fish, but nobody went to give there the chemicals."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They will say, nature supplies the chemicals.",Prabhupāda," So therefore that nature's potency isacintya.That is beyond your calculation. That is our point. How nature is supplying, that you do not know. How there is very common thing. Just like from my body there are so many worms and germs will come out from the stool, there are so many worms. I am also producing life. I am not going to add some chemical. But the chemical is being supplied by me, by my potency. Otherwise, why so many worms are there in the stool? Hookworm and this worm and that worm? Sometimes from wood, what is called, termite? They come. And who is going to supply there chemical? And not from all wood. At a certain stage, it will come, without your adding chemicals."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The chemicals are already there.,Prabhupāda," Already there. Everywhere chemicals are there. When the suitable circumstance is complete, then there is life.Svedaja.They are calledsvedaja.By fermentation, by perspiration, life will come.Aṇḍaja. Aṇḍajameans coming from the egg. (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,I've started working.,Prabhupāda, Ah. A great task. That will be a triumph forKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement.
SvarūpaDāmodara,[break]Brahma-vaivartaPurāṇa?Asatiṁcaiva caturolakṣam...(?),Prabhupāda, Tān...
SvarūpaDāmodara,jīva-jātiṣu.,Prabhupāda," Jīva-jātiṣu.Jīva-jātiṣu.That means the evolution means from one form to another. The forms are already...Jātiṣu.Their facilities, they are already there. The living entity is simply transferring himself. The same example: One man is transferring himself from one apartment to another. That apartment is first-class, second-class, third-class. Just a person has come from a lower class apartment to a first-class apartment. The person is the same. Now, according to hiskarmaor according to his capacity of payment, he has got a good apartment. This is...Bhramadbhiḥ.Bhramatmeans wandering, wandering. Not that they... Evolution means developing. Is it not?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes. I understand that part, but I also come across from Śrīla Prabhupāda's commentary on theBhagavad-gītāthat the living entities, all the living entities, 8,400,000 species, they are simultaneously created.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"That means there are some living entities, say for example, human beings. They come right away to the human platform without undergoing the...",Prabhupāda," Yes,Brahmā. Just likeBrahmā. He is in human form only with four hands. He is the first born. And then he created other living entities.Brahmāis first born fromViṣṇu. He has got four heads, four hands, two legs, he can speak. It is human form. Then, from him other forms came out,marīcyādi,ṛṣi,great great, saintly persons.Nārada,Kumāra. In this way, creation was there."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So the evolution of life... Those who are coming to the lowest living entity, the organisms, smaller units, so once they come to that stage, then they have to pass through the stages stepwise.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Just the same example: As you get more money, you can acquire better apartment. The apartment is already there. Not that a apart..., this lower class apartment has become high class apartment. This is their nonsense. The Darwin nonsense theory is like that: ""The apartment has become lower class to higher class."" That is his theory."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, he is saying that evolving from the smaller units. So they are claiming that there was no human beings at the beginning, so the smaller living entities...",Prabhupāda," But they are claiming that there is no life. That is their defect. Therefore they cannot think how there can be human being. But if you begin from life, supreme life,Viṣṇu, from another life,Brahmācame, then there is no problem. Everything is all right. Because they think that life comes from matter, so millions and millions of years ago there was simply matter. Life was not visible. That is their theory. We don't say that. We say both are the energies, God's energies, life and matter. The life is superior energy; the matter is inferior energy. That is the difference. Both of them are existing. Same thing, example: This nail and this part existing always. This is superior part, this is inferior."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are existing simultaneously or living entity creates.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Without nails how can I exist? Without skin, how can I exist? My existence means everything—my skin, my hair, my nails, my legs, my hands, everything."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So one is dependent on the other? Or the spirit is independent of matter?,Prabhupāda," The spirit is independent. Just like I am existing. That is life. And there are other limbs of the body. I can live even without limbs of my body, but I cannot live without life. If I have no hands, no legs, still I live. So therefore I am not dependent on hands and legs. My hands and legs are dependent on me. (pause) Is it not better to walk little, then sit down, compact room?"
Karandhara,"Oh yes, it's necessary to walk a little.",Prabhupāda," Yes. (laughs) Just get my cloth. Where it is? Missing? No, no, no.Harernāma...[Cc. Ādi17.21]. Our theory is sound. The rascal's theory is not sound. Ours is not theory; it is fact. Just likeKṛṣṇasays,mattaḥsarvaṁpravartate:""From Me everything emanates.""Vedānta-sūtrasays,janmādyasyayataḥ: [SB1.1.1]The Absolute Truth is that from where everything comes."" But everything we see, life and matter. This is everything. What we see in this world? Life and matter. Is it not?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, That is everything. So life also comes from Him and matter also comes from Him. Energy.
SvarūpaDāmodara,But both come simultaneously?,Prabhupāda," No, no, not simultaneously. It is there already. Coming, idea is coming because we are in this limited world. We see everything here, we see there is beginning. So under that experience, we are thinking it is coming. But it's not coming."
SvarūpaDāmodara,It is already existing.,Prabhupāda," Already there. Therefore they are missing the clue. Coming, beginning from here. They are rascals. It is already there. God is eternal and everything is eternal. His energy is eternal. Matter and spirit, everything is there. I am born, I think that this is the beginning of the world. Nonsense, the world was there long ago. Everything was there existing. Just like you get heat from fire. So does it mean heat is beginning? Whenever there is fire, there is heat. But I think, ""Now there is fire, heat will come."" Heat will not come. It is already there. You will experience. Similarly, heat and light is... Everything is there in fire. If the fire is there, heat and light is there. There is no question of beginning. What do they say? The heat and light, there was beginning? About the..."
SvarūpaDāmodara,There is a source for heat and light.,Prabhupāda, Yes. So source is already there. Therefore heat and light is already there.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So the varieties of living entities that we find in the material world, can we explain because of the desire of the living entities, to make..., to live in different houses?",Prabhupāda," Yes. He knows. Just like government constructs a prison house. Government knows there will be rascals, criminals. So already is there prison. Before the judgement the prison house is already there.Sarva-jña.God issarva-jña.He knows everything. So He knows that some of them will come out criminal. Just like king knows that not that always everyone will be honest. There will be dishonest. So construct this prisonhouse. Like that. God knows,Kṛṣṇaknows that this material world, the varieties of desires according to the modes of material nature... So there are three modes of... You can calculate also. Just like there are three modes of material nature,sattva-guṇa,rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.Now if you make variety, three into three, it becomes nine. And nine into nine, it becomes eighty-one. So there is eighty-four. What is the difficulty to understand? These three qualities, just like three colors, blue, red and yellow, you mix. Oh, thousands of different colors you will find. It is the expert color combination. That's all. Similarly this material world is made of three qualities and if you make varieties, mix them again eighty-one to eighty-one you can mix. So it requires expert handling. So that expert handling is there. Nature is there.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇi[Bg.3.27].Guṇaiḥ.This very word is used,guṇaiḥ.By the qualities,prakṛtiis manufacturing different types of body, varieties of body: plants, trees, aquatics, human beings, demigods, cats, dogs, so many things, 8,400,000."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So when theParamātmāand thejīvātmāare within the same material living body, so the...",Prabhupāda," Paramātmāis not material body.Paramātmā'senergy. Just like heat and light is the energy of the sun. The sun is not feeling heat and light. For him, everything is all right. There is no heat in the sun, body of the sun. He doesn't feel any heat. You are feeling heat. Similarly, forParamātmāthere is no such thing: this is material, this is spiritual.Parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65, purport].We hear that He has got different energies. His energy is one.Viṣṇu-śaktiḥparā.That is spiritual only. Just like sunshine. That is sunshine. Now we are seeing it is covered with cloud. It is our imperfectness. But there, in the sun, there is no such thing cloud. Experience, practical experience. The sun is not experiencing cloud, although there is cloud. We are experiencing. Similarly, this matter and spirit is for us, not for Him. He, either He comes in so-called material body or spiritual body it is the same. It is the same. For Him it is like that, the same, because it is His energy. He can turn matter into spirit, spirit into matter. That He can do."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So making these houses, temporary houses, is directed by Him.",Prabhupāda," No. Directed bymāyā.Prakṛteḥ,prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27].Is it dry or wet? (the ground)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Not very wet, just a little wet.",Prabhupāda," He has nothing to do.Natasyakāryaṁkaraṇaṁcavidyate.Just like I am head of the institution. I have nothing to do. I say, ""Karandhara,do it."" Immediately does. I say you, do it, immediately... I say him. I have got so many secretaries. I will ask him. Similarly, why God will create."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But there is a direction.,Prabhupāda," Direction, yes. That is said,mayādhyakṣenaprakṛtiḥ: [Bg.9.10]""Under My direction."" So if it is possible for a common man like me, how much it is possible for God? That we have to understand. Now I want to go to India, London. Now everything arrangement is made. I can go immediately. So similarly, if God wants to do something, why He has to do something? Everything, as soon as He desires, everything is there. He wants ""Let there be material creation."" There is, immediately. This is God. We are thinking in my terms. ""Oh, such a huge universe! How a person can create? Where he got this tool? Where he's got the hammer? And how he constructed it?"" I am thinking like that. Because I am limited, I am thinking in my limited way. So I am denying, ""There is no God."" Therefore we have to first of all understandacintya,inconceivable power. Then we can understand God. If I think, ""God may be..."" Thatkūpa-maṇḍūka,that frog is thinking, ""It may be little bigger than this, little bigger than this."" So how you can understand Atlantic Ocean within the well? So these rascals are all frogs. So they are thinking in their own terms, God. And because they cannot accommodate, ""There is no God, finish."" The same example: the rabbit, ""Close the eyes, there is no danger."" Finish. That's it. They are no better than the rabbits, these so-called scientists. Closing the eyes, there is no God. You have to smash them by their,Toralatina, torśilātornaamoratorabāṇidānteragora.(?)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Torśilā?,Prabhupāda, Śilāyou know?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Ah,huh.",Prabhupāda," Andnorameans mortar and what is called, pestle? So it is yourśilānora.I take it and break your teeth. (laughter) So take their, this jugglery of words and break their teeth. That should be the policy. ""These molecules and this and that,"" so many words. You have to simply catch their words, and with their words kill them. That is intelligence. We are saying plainly. You say with these words which is theirsona,mortar and pestle, and break their teeth. That's all.Toraśilātoranoratorabāṇidānteragora.(?) This policy should be adopted. Otherwise, we know they are rascals. But if I say, rascal, people will say, ""You are not a scientific man, how you can say he is rascal?"" ""Therefore I am flattering you that otherwise..."" You haven't got to convince me, that (he's a) rascal. I know that he is a rascal. Now, because we have to prove that he is a rascal to another rascal, we have to take your help. This is our policy. Otherwise, so far we are concerned, if they go on lecturing for millions of years, we shall kick on their face. You should know he is mistaken. Let the rascal speak whatever he likes. We know the conclusion."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So in trying to make a house, we need certain materials to build the house.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Materials are already there.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So similarly when the living entities, when they come down to the material platform...",Prabhupāda, Material is already there. Just like what you are manufacturing. You are... Already everything is there.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So the chemists or the scientists, what they're thinking is, there are chemical elements, which are the materials necessary for staying the spirit soul within the..., so long as he is within the material world. So they're saying that these material elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen—the main elements, somehow they combine together forming the living units, but our point is the chemicals are there, but in order to start the real nice house, the spirit soul has to enter within these chemical elements.",Prabhupāda," Yes. These chemical elements will already help him, by nature's way. Just like you put a seed on the earth. So other things necessary for fructifying that seed, that is already there. They will come to help it. That is already there. Just like the living entity in seed form is impregnated within the womb of the mother. The mother has got within the womb all ingredients. Body will develop. On account of the presence of the living entity, by the laws of nature, everything is there. A dog is forming dog's body, man is forming man's body. Why? Because everything is there. A cat is forming cat's body in the womb of the...Yathāyoniryathābījam.You haven't got to search out. It is already there."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So they may ask, ""How do I know that the living entities...""",Prabhupāda," What you know? You do not know first of all. Therefore you have to take information from theśāstra.Karmaṇādaivanetreṇajantur dehopapattaye [SB3.31.1].This is there. Thejīvais doing something, and higher authorities are giving him the result: ""Now you have done this. Now you live in this way, in condition."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,"That part we can explain by... When they ask, ""How do I know that the living entities...?""",Prabhupāda," Just like a man is condemned for going to the jail. The man who will take him to the jail, the jail and everything is already there. The arrangement for his living in the jail, everything is complete there."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Can we explain byacintyaśakti,Śrīla Prabhupāda? If we say, how we enter, that is the difference between the...",Prabhupāda," No, that isacintya-śakti.You cannot think how it is done."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But it is done.,Prabhupāda," It is done. Just like sometimes I think that I came here alone without any expectation of success, and this movement has become so nice. Actually, by one man's effort it was not possible. But it has become so. This isacintya-śakti,Kṛṣṇa's, inconceivable. Even a modern businessman, he cannot organize such a worldwide organization in such short a time. We have talked with many businessmen in India. Some said, ""We have got thirty branches,"" somebody says, ""We have got forty,"" another twenty branches. Our students say ""MyGuruMahārājahas 102 branches."" So they say, ""No, we cannot compare with yourGuruMahārāja."" So this isacintya-śakti.You can see so many things, theacintya-śaktiis working. So unless we acceptacintya-śaktiof God, it is not possible to understand what is God. Inconceivable potency. And that is actually a fact. We want to bring God to our level, that's frog philosophy. Atlantic Ocean to the level of well. That is foolishness. That is foolishness. We have to understand that this whole universe... Just likeArjunasaw thevirāḍ-rūpa,universal form. So this whole universe is the form of the Lord. So if in my body there are so many chemicals, enzymes, and other things, so how much there must be, proportionately? Suppose if we find some portion of chemicals in my body, you will find less in the ant's body. Or you will find more in the elephant's body. So if I can create so many chemicals within my body, how much chemicals He can create? On that account... Your theory, that combination of hydrogen, oxygen makes water, that is a fact. But you are surprised, wherefrom such a big quantity of hydrogen, oxygen came so that the ocean is there. That you cannot calculate. But we answer: ""This hydrogen, oxygen is there in the body, universal body of the Lord."" Therefore you find. Why do they, do not understand this plain thing? Hydrogen, oxygen we accept; that's a fact. But you are surprised wherefrom this big quantity of hydrogen, oxygen came? That we answer. So let us cooperate. Then the people will be happy. That isacintya-śakti.If a poor man cannot spend ten dollars and if a rich man immediately spends million dollars, he becomes surprised, ""How it is possible? How it is possible?"" It is like that. We have got the capacity of not even ten dollars. We are thinking of millions and trillion dollars.Adaravapariyahankhabor.(?) You know this?Adar, adar, adarmeans ginger. A ginger merchant, he is asking, ""When the another ship will come?"" Ginger is never purchased ship loaded. You take little ginger. If you have got one bag of ginger, then it will be sold in three years. Soadar vapariyahankhabor.(?) What you have got to do with ship, shipment? You just carry one bag or ten sheer(?) or ten kilos... That's all. So these rascals, they areadar vapari,and they are taking account of where is that ship."
SvarūpaDāmodara,I've noticed that there is a misunderstanding in the definition of living and the non-living among the scientific communities.,Prabhupāda, What is their definition?
SvarūpaDāmodara,They are saying that living beings can reproduce and can grow and can make...,Prabhupāda," Yes, that we say. That we also say."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"But there are also non-living matters like crystals. They can grow. We can divide them, and it will reproduce like...",Prabhupāda," No, without living entity within, nothing can grow."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Yes. So some are saying that when they make these chemicals like the big molecules that we were talking about, DNA... And they are saying that DNA can make its own replication, means it can make another chain of molecules by its own. So they are saying that it is living.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,And some are saying that it's not living.,Prabhupāda, That means their knowledge is imperfect. Somebody is saying something somebody is saying something. That means imperfect.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So if we define the definition what is living and what is non-living, so living means that contains consciousness.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"And the non-living, that has no consciousness.",Prabhupāda," No. That is the difference. That is defined inBhagavad-gītā.Avināśitutadviddhiyenasarvamidaṁtatam.That thing which is spread all over your body, that isavināśi,that is eternal.Antavantaimedehā[Bg.2.18].This, what is said... The body isantavantaḥ,perishable.Nityasyoktāḥśarīriṇaḥ.And the spirit within the body, that is eternal. That they cannot understand."
SvarūpaDāmodara,So we can also say that according to the different shapes of the material bodies and qualities...,Prabhupāda," Different opportunities... Yes. According to consciousness we have got the shape of the body. If you have got dog's consciousness, then you get a dog's body. If you have got a god's consciousness, you get a demigod's body."
SvarūpaDāmodara,It is the desire of the spirit soul.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Yeyathāmāṁprapadyante[Bg.4.11].Freedom is given.Kṛṣṇasays, ""Whatever you want, you can take.""Yāntideva-vratādevānpitṝnyāntipitṛ-vratāḥ[Bg.9.25].Everything is freedom."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Then why is it in theVaivartaPurāṇa,after traveling 8,400,000 species of life, we get this human form of life? Is that contradiction with the...?",Prabhupāda," No. Because in the lower form of life, the progress is by the laws of nature, and in the human form of life, you get consciousness development. Therefore you have got discretion. The other forms, they have no discretion, one after another."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No. My point being the... Some human beings, they come without traveling through these 8,400,000 species.",Prabhupāda, Then he can come.
SvarūpaDāmodara,So this applies only to those living entities who are born...,Prabhupāda," They are advanced in consciousness. They are advanced in consciousness. Suppose you are advanced in consciousness. So you are not going to get the dog's body or cat's body. You get another human body.Yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate.Yoga-bhraṣṭaḥis not ordinary man. He is practicingyoga, but somehow or another could not fulfill. Therefore he gets again human body. He does not get the cat's body, dog's body. So he directly comes to the human body. There is no question of evolution. Same example. The apartments are already there. If you can pay more, ""Come on, this apartment is ready for you."" Not that you have to come from the lower platform, lower animal apartments.Daiva-netreṇa.The judgement will be done by the higher authorities. They do not know that."
Karandhara,"Prabhupāda, we should start going back.",Prabhupāda," Yes.Karmaṇādaiva-netreṇa[SB3.31.1].Your work, and supervision-higher authorities."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is completely in contradiction with Darwin's theory.,Prabhupāda," Darwin is a rascal. What is his theory? We kick on your face. That's all. That is our philosophy. The more we kick on Darwin's face, the more advanced in spiritual consciousness. He has killed the whole civilization, rascal."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Even all the scientists now, the present scientists, their arguments are based on Darwin's early theories.",Prabhupāda, What they are...?
SvarūpaDāmodara,That life started from matter and is evolving from the uni-cellular organisms to the multi-cellular organisms. So that means they are saying that there was no higher species at the beginning of creation.,Prabhupāda," Nonsense. So why there is now higher species? And the lower species also. As we see at the present moment, there is the most intellectual person and the most foolish ass also... So why do we see all the things simultaneously? Why ass is not abolished? What is their answer? So similarly, formerly also there was."
Karandhara,"They say, ""parallel evolution."" They say in the process of evolution some are advancing and some are remaining stable.",Prabhupāda," So if that, even parallel, then there isBrahmā. He is most advanced. Why do you say there was no human being? There was. Therefore their theory, ""In such and such era the human life began,"" that is wrong if they accept parallel. They are existing always. And as we see. Now as we see, the trees are there, birds are there, animals are there, human beings are there, God is there, demigod is there. Everything is there. Where is the question of evolution? Simply we have to enter. That's all."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Do we have anything, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the reference, saying that all the living entities are already there?",Prabhupāda," Yes, thatjīva-jātiṣu."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Oh, and that implies?",Prabhupāda," Jīva-jāti,different grades ofjīva.Jāti,you knowjāti?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like there are different nations. They are already existing. Sojātimeans that.Jātimeans born of a particular species. That isjāti.Jīva-jātiṣu. Ṣu,plural number. So manyjīva-jātiṣu.He's simplyBhramadbhiḥ.Just like I am traveling, sometimes America, some Australia, sometimes... But they are already there. I am going sometimes in America, sometimes Australia, sometimes Africa, but they are already there. I am the man; I am traveling. Not that because I have to come to America, I create America. This is nonsense. And there are many countries I have not gone there. Does it mean that they are not existing? They have no even human reason, these rascal scientists. The common sense reason. AndBhagavad-gītāclearly says they are already existing. Wherever you like, you can go. You can go even up to the kingdom of God if you so desire. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā."
SvarūpaDāmodara,I want to know a little more about the... (end),Prabhupāda, ...to stop him for taking another Nobel Prize. Where is? (laughter) I am giving him notes that life is not from matter. Matter is from life. So he is going to write thesis on this.
Paramahaṁsa,Jaya.Vedānta-sūtra.,Prabhupāda," This is the fact. The so-called scientists, they are going on a wrong theory.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavaḥ: [Bg.10.8] ""I am the origin of everything."" SoKṛṣṇais life.Kṛṣṇais not dead stone.SvarūpaDāmodara?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇasays that ""I am the source of everything."" He is life."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yes.,Prabhupāda, He is not a dead stone. Then how matter can be the cause of life?
SvarūpaDāmodara,Matter is caused by life.,Prabhupāda," Yes, matter grows upon life. Just like why this body has grown upon me? I am the spirit soul. This ismāyā.Just like, this is... I have explained inBhagavad-gītā.I am putting on this overcoat. The overcoat is made according to the size of my body, but I am thinking, ""I am overcoat."" This is foolishness. Just like I got my hand, therefore this overcoat is made of warm cloth. It has got a hand also. Because originally I have got hand, therefore the overcoat has got a hand. Similarly, originally I am spirit soul, I have got my spiritual body, and the material body has grown, cut according to the body."
Paramahaṁsa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about in mineralogy? Scientists have proven that, for example, mountains are growing by sedimentary activity.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is also growing on spirit soul, Supersoul."
Paramahaṁsa,In the mountain?,Prabhupāda," Yes, everything. Mountains have been described in theBhāgavataas the bones of God. These grasses are described as hairs on the body of God. These holes, there are holes, we saw that. They have been described as oceans. So in this way, thisvirāṭ,the biggest body. As the smallest body is producing chemical, similarly the biggest body also, producing chemical. A small tree, lemon tree, how many pounds of the citric acid it is produced?"
Paramahaṁsa,I do not know.,Prabhupāda," No, producing, you know."
Paramahaṁsa,Yes.,Prabhupāda," So if the tree can produce so much chemicals, how much the body of God can produce chemicals, we can imagine only. They are giving the theory that ""From these chemicals life begins, or evolution begins."" But wherefrom that chemical developed? That they do not know. That explanation is here,Kṛṣṇa: ""I am the source."""
Paramahaṁsa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamor theKṛṣṇaBook,you state that even clouds have souls. But then again they dissipate, in the rain they dissolve. Does that mean they die?",Prabhupāda, No. Just like your body dissolves. Does it mean you die?
Paramahaṁsa,So that means the life span of a cloud is very minute or very short. Is that so?,Prabhupāda," Yes, there are many living entities."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, my understanding of the evolution and the transmigration is that evolution is uni-directional, only in one direction.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Whereas the transmigration can be both, in both directions. They can go up or can go down.",Prabhupāda," No. Both ways. When you say ""trans,"" ""trans"" does not mean stereotyped. For lower animals, that is one side, and for human being, both sides. Because after all, the body is made according to your desire. The lower animals, they have got one kind of desire, but the human being, he has got thousands and millions of desires."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So the platform of transmigration from the human platform, so it works, either it can go down or it can go up.",Prabhupāda," No, transmigration (is) going on. They are coming automatically, animals, to the upper level of human form. But when you come to human form, if you don't cultivateKṛṣṇaconsciousness, you remain as cats and dog, then you become again cat and dog."
SvarūpaDāmodara,But the evolution stops when the spirit soul reaches the eternal abode in the spiritual...,Prabhupāda," Yes, when he is no more entangled by a material body.HareKṛṣṇa."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The scientists have no information that there is evolution after human platform.,Prabhupāda," That is their rascaldom. Therefore I say they are rascals. They have no knowledge; still, they proclaim they are scientists."
Paramahaṁsa,They think that evolution is continuing. They think that the human species will...,Prabhupāda," Yes, evolution... That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā:yāntideva-vratādevānpitṝnyāntipitṛ-vratāḥ[Bg.9.25].Progress is going on. That progress, the ultimate progress isyadgatvānanivartantetaddhāmaparamaṁmama[Bg.15.6].That where you're going, you do not return, that is the supreme progress.Saṁsiddhiṁparamāṁgatāḥ.That is the highest perfection. You readBhagavad-gītā.Everything is there.Māmupetyakaunteyapunarjanmanavidyate. Duḥkhālayamaśāśvatam, nāpnuvantimahātmānaḥsaṁsiddhiṁparamāṁgatāḥ[Bg.8.15].They have no idea what is the highest perfection of human life."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They are saying that the material body started from elements, the chemical elements.",Prabhupāda, That we admit also. That we also admit. But on what basis?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"And when the spirit soul, when the living entity reaches the human platform, then again goes back to the...",Prabhupāda, Do the rascals believe in the living entity?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, they don't say living entity. Bodies.",Prabhupāda, Then?
Paramahaṁsa,Something akin to Buddhism.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,"The Buddhists also say that the body is like a house. You put the house together, you put the body together with chemicals. And when the bodies die, just like you take the house apart, all the wood, and then there is no more house... no more soul, no more life.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is callednirvāṇa.And with the chemicals you can build another house. Buddhists they do not give any information of the soul. That is Buddhism. What...? Oh, wet? (the ground?)"
SvarūpaDāmodara; Paramahaṁsa,"No, it's dry.; There's another very interesting factor that scientists, they state that matter is, or that there is, they dispute the fact that there's one soul within the body. There's a special kind of worm, it's an earthworm, that if you cut it in half, both parts will live.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,"So they wonder how is it possible that if there is soul, that there could be two souls within one body?",Prabhupāda," Yes, why not. Souls takes the opportunity."
Paramahaṁsa,"Oh, it takes the opportunity of the other body, the fertile...",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"The spirit soul must necessarily have a body, either spiritual or material.",Prabhupāda," He has got already spiritual body. Material body is his covering. It is unnatural. Real body is spiritual. Just like your coat, this is unnatural. But your real body is natural. Otherwise how transmigration is possible? I am accepting different unnatural bodies. Unnatural means to my constitution. My real constitutional body is servant ofKṛṣṇa. So, so long I do not come to that position, I remain servant of nature and I get so many bodies. According to the nature's direction I am getting body, I am giving it up, again I am desiring something, I am getting another body. This is going on.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥkarmāṇisarvaśaḥ,ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā [Bg.3.27].He is a rascal. He is thinking, ""I am this body.""Īśvaraḥsarva-bhūtānāṁhṛd-deśe'rjunatiṣṭhati,bhrāmayansarva-bhūtāniyantrārūḍhānimāyayā[Bg.18.61].This is ayantra, machine. And we are traveling many species of life, all riding on this car, given by nature.Yantrārūḍhānimāyayā.Māyāhas given this vehicle, anywhere wandering, up and down, sometimes demigod, sometimes dog. This is going on. And in this wandering process, if he gets in touch with a devotee, then his real spiritual life begins. Otherwise he has to go on, rotating."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Mahāprabhu?,Prabhupāda," Yes,CaitanyaMahāprabhu. By mercy of spiritual master, the mercy ofKṛṣṇa, he gets the seed of devotional service, and if he cultivates, then his life becomes successful. Otherwise he has to rotate, sometimes up, sometimes down. Sometimes this grass, sometimes lion."
Paramahaṁsa,"But ultimately if we come toKṛṣṇa, there's no return. But nevertheless,Jagāi, and..., the two gatekeepers, they returned?",Prabhupāda," There is return, that is voluntary. Return there is."
Paramahaṁsa,If we want.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,So we can come to the spiritual world and return?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,Fall down?,Prabhupāda," Yes. As soon as we try, ""Oh, this material world is very nice,"" ""Yes,""Kṛṣṇasays, ""yes, you go."" Just like nobody is interested inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Do you think everyone is interested? So. They want to enjoy this material world. Otherwise what is the meaning of free will? Every living entity has got a little free will. AndKṛṣṇais so kind, He gives him opportunity, ""All right, you enjoy like this."" Just like some of our students,Kṛṣṇaconscious, sometimes go away, again come back. It is free will, not stereotyped. Just like one goes to the prisonhouse, not that government welcomes, ""Come on. We have got prisonhouse. Come here, come here."" He goes out of his free will; again comes out, again goes. Like that.Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukhahañābhogavāñchākare,nikaṭa-sthamāyātārejāpaṭiyādhare(Prema-vivarta).The police is there. Just like the police car was there. We have nothing to do with it. But if you do anything criminal, immediately you will be arrested, under police custody. Themāyāmay be there, butmāyācaptures him who is not a devotee ofKṛṣṇa. That's all. Therefore,māmevayeprapadyantemāyāmetāṁtarantite:""Anyone who surrenders unto Me,māyādoes not interfere anymore."""
Paramahaṁsa,"So our desire to enjoy, we achieve these bodies; and our desire to achieveKṛṣṇabrings us to our natural position.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,But then again there's this constant struggle with our lower nature? We are constantly fighting our desires even though we want to serveKṛṣṇa? This continues?,Prabhupāda, What is that? I do not follow.
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, like, many devotees, they experience the difficulty that although they sincerely want to love God and serve Him, yet their body is almost like another dictator within them.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That means he is strongly under the grip ofmāyā.
Paramahaṁsa,Even though the desire exists.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like a thief, he knows that ""If I steal, I will be arrested. I will be put into jail."" And he has seen that one thief, he has stolen, he is arrested. Still he commits theft. He knows everything. Why does he commit theft?"
Paramahaṁsa,Why?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,Ignorance?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Śrīla Prabhupāda gives the example of the elephant.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Takes shower again and...,Prabhupāda," Yes.Hasti-snāna.Therefore, knowledge giving, that is the beginning of spiritual life.KṛṣṇagivesArjuna, knowledge giving, that ""You are not this body."" This is the beginning of knowledge. What is that knowledge, all over the world? Where is that university? This preliminary knowledge whichKṛṣṇabegins,Bhagavad-gītā, where is that university?SvarūpaDāmodara, where is that chemical laboratory or university?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,There is none in the universities.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So this is the position of your education. There is no knowledge, and you are simply advertising, ""Advancement of knowledge, university, PhD's, Nobel Prize holder."" But they are all rascals. Fools' paradise. It is called, fools' paradise."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"If the scientists know that we are not this body, then definitely the whole outlook will be changed.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That we want to do.
Paramahaṁsa,They don't want to admit their failure.,Prabhupāda," That is another foolishness. If you are a fool and if you want toposeyourself as intelligent, that is another foolishness. You cannot make progress. Stubborn dogs. If you are seeking after knowledge, you must take the right knowledge. That is intelligence. And if you want to remain in ignorance and advertise yourself that ""I am man of knowledge,"" how much cheater you are! You are cheating yourself and cheating others. That is going on. We want to stop this."
Paramahaṁsa,"Just like many of our devotees, we experienced when we tried to preach to our parents, because they are much older, to admit thatKṛṣṇaconsciousness is the right path in life, means to also admit that they have wasted their entire life.",Prabhupāda," Real knowledge is to be given to the younger section. Older section, it is not possible. They will have to forget first of all, what they have learned. That they cannot. Therefore it is impossible. Therefore knowledge begins from the school children, not from the man who is going to die. (laughing) That is not... Impractical. ThereforePrahlādaMahārājasaidkaumāraācaretprājñodharmānbhāgavatān: [SB7.6.1] ""Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be taught from the very childhood."" Not that at the time of death. That is not possible. Therefore our students, they are all young generation, they capture. These rascals, they cannot. Old fools, they cannot. There was a practical examination. One father and one daughter, both appeared forBAexamination in India. The daughter passed and the father failed. It was in the newspaper. In old age they cannot take any lessons. They forget."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,Because of sense gratification or mind...,Prabhupāda," Anyway, they say all... Yes. The bodily functions, intelligence...,"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Blunt, intelligence becomes blunt.",Prabhupāda," Yes, blunt. When the knife is sharp, it can cut, but if it is become blunt, then you cannot cut."
Paramahaṁsa,Or worn by age.,Prabhupāda," Yes. They have all been described asmāyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ: [Bg.7.15] ""Their real knowledge is taken away bymāyā."" Therefore we don't give any credit to all these rascals. Although we are very small, but we don't give any credit. We frankly say, ""These are rascals, fools."""
Paramahaṁsa,After the 20th...During the Industrial Revolution in the western world....,Prabhupāda," The Industrial Revolution means revolution of theśūdras.That is Industrial Revolution. Increasing the number ofśūdras.These scientists, they are alsośūdras.Because they have no real knowledge.Brāhmaṇameans one who has got real knowledge.Brahma-jānātītibrāhmaṇaḥ.And this industrial development means technologists; they areśūdras."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,But they have taken the position ofbrāhmaṇasin the society.,Prabhupāda," No, no. They are never as... They are always working. How they can take the position of thebrāhmaṇa? Brāhmaṇa'sposition is to teachbrāhmaṇaknowledge,brahma-jñāna.That isbrāhmaṇa."
Paramahaṁsa,Prior to the growth of technology...,Prabhupāda," Yes. No, there was technology. But not in such large scale. Village technology. There was a blacksmith. You want a knife. You take one piece of steel, and he will do it,phutphutphutphut, and he'll put in the fire, and everything do. And now you are manufacturing these cutleries, cutleries, in larger scale. So they areśūdras.Similarly any factory, it is a combination ofśūdras.Kalauśūdra-sambhavaḥ:""In this age, all areśūdras."" Only we are trying to becomebrāhmaṇa.Otherwise allśūdras.So therefore there is no adjustment. Just like if you have got only legs, no arms, no mouth, so what is this body?"
Paramahaṁsa,Corpse.,Prabhupāda," Corpse, yes. You require everything, full body. You require head, you require arms, you require belly, you require legs. But if you have got simply the belly and legs, then it is a dead body. It cannot work properly. The brain is lost; therefore they aremadafter so much advancement of civilization. They are exactly like cats and dogs. As soon as you enter some country, dog, watchdog: ""Wowf! Wowf! Why you have come? What is your position?"" (""Where is yourvisa?""?) This is dog's business. This is dog's business. (laughter) And they have set up immigration department. But it is a dog's business, watchdog. I say it is watchdog's business. A first-class gentleman is being searched out pocket, whether you have got revolver. Cannot be trusted, all these educated rogues and thieves. So what is this advancement of civilization? It is civilization? No sober man, no intelligent man, all cats and dogs, thieves, rogues. Is that civilization? It is not civilization."
Paramahaṁsa,"The question I have, Prabhupāda is that before scientific advancement, many people would listen to, like, scriptural knowledge.",Prabhupāda, Yes. That meansśūdras.That I have already said.
Paramahaṁsa,But now they listen more to scientists.,Prabhupāda, That meansśūdra. Śūdrasare interested to hear fromśūdra.
Paramahaṁsa,"For example in the Bible they quote that the world is flat. So therefore when they found out the world is round, they say, ""Oh, scripture is false.""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,"Scientists, they have proven the truth that the world is round. Therefore scientists...",Prabhupāda," Yes. That must be, therefore the scriptures must be transcendental. Nonsense scripture, and people become nonsense. So except Vedic literature, all nonsense scripture. They are not scripture. Manufactured. This Bible was manufactured by the saint, this saint, that, according to their imagination. It was not spoken by Lord Jesus Christ. What was spoken by Jesus Christ, that they ignore: ""Thou shalt not kill."" They kill. Nobody is following Christian principle; neither Bible is perfect. But that, if we say, we will be shot. (laughter)"
Paramahaṁsa,That is what they do now in the Vietnam. For God they are killing.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Paramahaṁsa,"One of the reasons that the Vietnamese war was beginning was because Communists, being atheists, it was a fight between the theists and the atheists. This was an excuse given.",Prabhupāda, Yes. But that is quite all right. We also prepare to kill atheists.
Paramahaṁsa,But preach first.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,They don't preach.,Prabhupāda," That is, killing is also preaching. If I kill your ignorance, that is also killing. That is also killing. Not... Killing does not mean that everyone has to take the sword."
Paramahaṁsa,A new method of warfare.,Prabhupāda," Yes, it is always there. By argument, by knowledge."
SvarūpaDāmodara; Paramahaṁsa,"It's a little wet.; Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you are not present with us, how is it possible to receive instructions, for example, on questions that may arise?",Prabhupāda," Well, the questions... Answers are there in my books."
Paramahaṁsa,"Other than that, for example, that we would ask you in...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,Do you direct us also through the heart? Besides theParamātmā?,Prabhupāda, If your heart is pure. Everything depends on purity. Whether there. What is this? Sacrificial arena? (laughter)
Paramahaṁsa,"For children, I think. No? For cooking, yeah. (pause)",Prabhupāda," (About tennis players) How people are kept into ignorance. Life is so valuable, and they are wasting time in that way. Life is valuable, how life should be utilized, what is the object of life—they do not know anything."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Without knowing that the soul is eternal, everybody would be acting like this.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is... Bodily concept of life means animal life. The animal does not know.Saevago-kharaḥ[SB10.84.13]. Go-kharaḥ. Gomeans cows, andkharaḥmeans ass. One who is in the, under bodily concept of life, he is no better than animals. So when the animal talks of knowledge, an intelligent man laughs. That is our position. The animals, they are talking of knowledge."
Paramahaṁsa,"At least, the animals live by certain codes. They do not kill unless necessary. They only eat when necessary, whereas man, he kills unnecessarily, eats unnecessarily. So forgetting God, we are even lower than animals.",Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore we suffer also, more than the animals. (pause) SoKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is not a bogus religious sentimental movement. It is a scientific movement. So now it is up to you to prove this. Then you will be actuallyKṛṣṇaconscious. (pause) [break]"
SvarūpaDāmodara,So they were saying that everything in the universe is just happening by chance.,Prabhupāda, So you are writing book by chance. Then what is the value of your book?
Karandhara,The book is also by chance.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Everyone can write chance, so what is your credit? Anything nonsense can be written."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Monod is his name. He got Nobel Prize in 1965 from... He is Frenchman, physiologist. And his, chance and necessity about life, he said everything started by chance. So he is saying that by chance these chemicals combined together, forming these molecules, the basic molecules...",Prabhupāda, But wherefrom the molecules came?
SvarūpaDāmodara,According to him it is simply by chance.,Prabhupāda, Chance. So everything is chance. So what is the necessity of your writing book?
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Then necessity arises, so these moleculesre-orient, change as a fashion because of necessity.",Prabhupāda," Why? If everything is by chance, where is the necessity? What is the meaning? Let the chance take place. Why necessity?"
Paramahaṁsa,He is hoping for another Nobel Prize by his chance.,Prabhupāda," All fools' paradise. That's all. Why do they send their children to school? Why not let them grow by chance? Is there any excuse if I say, ""By chance I have violated this rule?"" Is that the cause of excuse?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,That's because of my ignorance.,Prabhupāda," That is chance. That is chance. Because I am ignorant, therefore there is chance."
Paramahaṁsa,It would be just as stupid as saying a beautiful instrument like a car was made by chance.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. That is the most regrettable condition, that these rascals are getting recognition; talking all foolish, and they are getting recognition."
SvarūpaDāmodara,It's so strange. When I read that book. He defines the difference between the living and the non-living by a term called teleonomy. I tried to find out in the dictionary and I couldn't find any word like that. But I understood that what he meant was...,Prabhupāda, Hyerpolosvel. (Prabhupāda's mythical scientific word) (laughter)
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī; SvarūpaDāmodara,He invents his own word jugglery.; He was trying to present the difference between organic beings and the non-organic beings. So he goes in such a round about fashion just to differentiate.,Prabhupāda," Petitio principii. This logic is called petitio principii. He has to prove something, but he is taking his premises from that something. (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,No.,Prabhupāda," They accept one energy. We accept also that. But they, defect is they are beginning from the material. That is their method. Just like this weather is beginning from the light and gradually it is becoming dark. So darkest part or the dark part is called material. But the dark is beginning from light, not the light is beginning from dark. That is their method. They are thinking that from matter, consciousness is coming. Now consciousness is there. When it is covered, degraded, that is unconsciousness. So material means when the consciousness is forgetful ofKṛṣṇa. That is material. Material means gradual development of forgetfulness ofKṛṣṇa. That is material. And spiritual means full consciousness ofKṛṣṇa. Is it clear? Try to understand this. Darkness is coming from light. Where the light is not visible that is called darkness. This is not the nature of the sun, this covering, cloudy nature. That is not the... The nature of sun is light, but by the energy of the sun another thing is temporary created which is called mist or darkness. This is temporary. This is not permanent nature. Therefore material nature is temporary and spiritual nature is permanent. So ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement is to get out of this temporary nature and go to the spiritual nature, permanent nature. Nobody wants also this temporary nature. Nobody likes this cloudy atmosphere."
SvarūpaDāmodara,The cloudiness is created from the superior energy.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,So material is created from the superior.,Prabhupāda," Creator is one. It is always superior. Whatever is created, that is created by Him.Kṛṣṇasays,ahaṁsarvasyaprabhavaḥ[Bg.10.8].""I am the creator of everything."" So bad or good, everything. Bad and good, that is your creation. Kṛṣṇa's creation everything good. God is good. What you think bad, for God is good. Therefore we cannot understandKṛṣṇa. He's doing something. In our consciousness it is bad, but we do not know that for him there is no such thing as good and bad. That we do not know.Kṛṣṇais marrying 16,000 wives, somebody's criticizing, ""Oh, He's so much fond of women."" But we do not see the other side. He has got the power to expand Himself into 16,000 forms."
Paramahaṁsa,"If this mist of material nature is temporary, then why bother to disentangle oneself from something transitory?",Prabhupāda, Why do you take covering? Does man walk naked?
Paramahaṁsa,No.,Prabhupāda, Why do you take covering? You know everything will be cleared after few hours. Why do you cover?
Paramahaṁsa,It is dangerous now.,Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, why do you take this step to avoid this?"
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,It's uncomfortable. It's not natural.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is theMāyāvādatheory; that everything will uncover automatically, why do you bother? That is nonsense."
Karandhara,They will not be able to be so philosophical in their next lives when they're a dog.,Prabhupāda, Eh? Eh?
Karandhara,The Māyāvādīs will not be able to be so philosophical in their next lives when they're dogs or cats.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Karandhara,They have to have a human body in order to enjoy that philosophy.,Prabhupāda," Their philosophy is that there is only one-God. So cats and dogs, that is God'slīlā.That is their rascal philo... God is making pastimes,līlā,by becoming a dog. That is their rascal philosophy.Daridra-nārāyaṇa.Vivekananda's philosophy.Nārāyaṇahas becomedaridra,poor.HareKṛṣṇa. (pause) So with chemists we have no quarrel if they begin from light. They're beginning from darkness. That is our contention. We say, ""Begin from light."" And they say, ""No, begin from darkness."" Because they're in darkness. One who is in the darkness, from darkness, if he goes to light, he thinks that the darkness is the beginning."
Paramahaṁsa,"In comparison, they always compare.",Prabhupāda," No, no comparison. It is practical. Suppose you have been in the darkness for millions of years and when you come to the light you think that ""Oh, from darkness the light has come."" Light, when it becomes dimmed, that is darkness. Not that (from) darkness, light has come."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,Darkness cannot exist without light.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Or in the light there is no darkness. When the light is dimmed that is darkness. Similarly, whenKṛṣṇaconsciousness is dimmed, that is material."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,It's very wet. (referring to the ground),Prabhupāda," Yes. After awaken, when one becomes tired he comes to sleep. Or the life, when it is somehow or other disturbed, sleepless comes. When at night we sleep and get up in the morning, it is not that from sleeping condition this life condition has come. I slept some reason or I was in life condition, but I slept, again I am coming to life. That is their philosophy. Just like a child, baby comes from the womb of the mother. From the day he comes out of the womb, if he thinks, ""Now, from this day my life has begun."" That is not the fact. He's eternal, but he was constructing his body within the womb of the mother, therefore he was unconscious. Now, as soon as the body is finished, he comes out and again comes to consciousness."
Karandhara,And again falls asleep at death.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is described in theBhagavad-gītā:bhūtvābhūtvāpralīyate[Bg.8.19].Once he comes to awareness and again he's unconscious. Just like this flower, it has come to now consciousness. Again it will dry and die but the seeds again will grow. Again it will dry. This is material life. And spiritual life means flower only. That's all. (pause) I have got some nice shirt buttons somebody has given me. I shall never put on shirt, neither our students. I think we shall sell it."
Devotee,Buttons?,Prabhupāda," What is called? Button, is it not button? Shirt-fixing? Collar-fixing?"
Devotee,Is it a pin or something like this?,Prabhupāda," Yes, like that...gold."
Devotee,Not cuff links. No those are...,Prabhupāda," Aha, cuffles."
Devotee,"Oh,jaya.Do you like I buy from you?",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,I give you my soul for the cuff links?,Prabhupāda," No, you take it and sell it. (pause) [break] The last four days this students are not clear."
Devotee,Man's best friend.,Prabhupāda," Hmm. Because he has no knowledge who is the best friend. According to the quality, friend is selected."
Karandhara,And one is known by the company he keeps.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Kāranaṁguṇa-saṅgo 'sya [Bg.13.22].The best friend will lead him to take birth in that family. He'll help him next birth because he'll always think of dog, so next birth, dog.Yaṁyaṁvāpismaranbhāvam[Bg.8.6].At the time of death, if you are attached to something then you'll think of it, and next birth is that."
Paramahaṁsa,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, if one's life is achieved by one's consciousness, how is it one cannot remember one's previous life?",Prabhupāda, Do you remember everything what you did last year or yesterday?
Paramahaṁsa,"No, I don't.",Prabhupāda, So that is your nature. You forget.
Paramahaṁsa,Something.,Prabhupāda," Something there is possibility of. Something..., somebody forgets more, somebody forgets little. But the forgetfulness is there."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That's the platform of material nature.,Prabhupāda, Just like stealing. Somebody's pick-pocket. Somebody's dacoit. The stealing is there.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"When we sleep, when we dream, are we carried away by the three subtle elements, mind, intelligence...",Prabhupāda, You are carried always by nature under different conditions. You're simply being carried by the nature.Prakṛteḥkriyamāṇāni[Bg.3.27].You are under the grip of material nature. Just like pulling the ear.
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,By our desires we are pulled?,Prabhupāda," No. You desire. There it is. That's how. It is not willingly because you are willing desires againstKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Therefore she's giving chance, ""Come on here. Take stool. Become hog. You wanted to eat stool. Come on."" This is going on."
SvarūpaDāmodara,This also shows the eternal nature of the spirit soul?,Prabhupāda," No, no, no. That is not eternal."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Because I'm conscious.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Therefore your consciousness is being revived. Come to the standard ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, you'll be happy. That is our business. His consciousness is being misled by so many ways. Therefore we are trying to give him the standard consciousness, ""Come to this point, you'll be happy."""
SvarūpaDāmodara,How to prove that the soul is eternal?,Prabhupāda," That is the first lesson. You do not understand? You are a child, now you're a grown up boy. Where is your childhood? Where is that body?Ha? The dead body does not exist but you are existing. That means you're eternal. Body has changed, but you have not changed. Circumstances have changed, but you have not changed. This is the proof of (indistinct). What do you want more? You may remember that I did yesterday these things, today I remember yesterday's activities, but your body of yesterday is not this body. Do you admit or not? As a scientist, the body has changed already. He cannot say that 1973, twelfth May yesterday. He cannot say. It is already changed. But you remember everything of yesterday. That is eternity. The body has changed, but you remember everything. Therefore you are eternal, body's not eternal. This is the proof. Simple proof, even a child can understand. But they'll not understand. That is the difficulty."
SvarūpaDāmodara,They want some more.,Prabhupāda," What is that more? It is a simple fact. Just like yesterday, day before yesterday, day before that we saw that stool. We therefore criticize. You are seeing for the last three days the stool, it is not cleansed. But day before yesterday's body, yesterday's body is not this body. And my body has changed, but I remember. Therefore I'm eternal. This is the proof. Eternity means I'm so... my body's changing, but I'm not changing. Just like, I'm old man. I sometimes think, ""Oh, I was jumping like this and now I cannot jump."" So my body has changed. But I want to jump. But I cannot do it. So that jumping propensity is my eternal propensity. But due to this body, I cannot do it. This is (indistinct)."
Karandhara,"They would say that, according to their observations, that nature of eternity only lasts one body.",Prabhupāda," That is their foolishness because, as this body... That is explained in theBhagavad-gītā:tathādehāntara-prāptiḥ[Bg.2.13].As this body's changing in my experience, similarly, there's another change."
Karandhara,"Well, actually, they're able to observe this change, but they can't observe that change.",Prabhupāda," But you cannot observe, your rascal eyes are so imperfect, you cannot observe so many things. That does not mean science. Why don't you admit your imperfectional senses? You first of all admit the imperfectional senses. You cannot see. You cannot experience. That, does it mean that is science? So many dogs they cannot understand what is the law of nature. Does it mean that nature does not exist? Why do you think your sense are perfect? First of all, admit that you're the most imperfect."
Karandhara,"They'll admit that, but they say the way of becoming perfect is through objective information and experience.",Prabhupāda, No. Way of becoming perfect is different. You cannot become perfect by your imperfect thinking. How you can become perfect?
Paramahaṁsa,"Another question, Prabhupāda, that could be raised is that ""If the soul is eternal and passes through one body after another, how is not possible that it accepts, let's say, three, four, five bodies and then dies?""",Prabhupāda," You are accepting millions of bodies and then die. That you do not know. I say that your body of yesterday is not of this body. So, similarly, if we live for one hundred years, how many bodies you are changing every moment? Just calculate."
Karandhara,Thirteen.,Prabhupāda, Ha? Thirteen? Why thirteen?
Karandhara,Every seven years.,Prabhupāda," No, no, every seven years. I say every second. Every second the blood corpuscles are changing. Is it not?"
Devotees,Yes.,Prabhupāda," Then you're chang... As soon as the blood corpuscle changes, you change your body. You do not know the science. So how many millions of birth you are changing even this experience?"
Karandhara,That is their stumbling block. They say they want to be able to observe everything with their imperfect senses.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is their folly, foolishness."
SvarūpaDāmodara,In the scientific terminology the eternality of the soul can be compared with the conservation of energy?,Prabhupāda, There is no question of conservation. It is energy. It is always existing. If you say that is conservation of energy then...
SvarūpaDāmodara,No. The definition of the conservation of energy is the energy cannot be created nor destroyed. That means that it is eternal.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes, that we admit. Original energy ofKṛṣṇa, that is existing withKṛṣṇaandKṛṣṇais eternal. Therefore all His energies are eternal."
Karandhara,So the living entity is also eternal.,Prabhupāda," Just like the sun. Sun, the energy heat and light. If sun is eternal, heat and light (are) eternal. Hmm. What is that?"
Karandhara,"They say energy cannot be created or destroyed, then life cannot be created or destroyed.",Prabhupāda," We say that. Life is eternal. It is not created nor destroyed. It is covered only for the time. Just like, I'm eternal, but last night I was covered by dreaming, sleeping. So I say ""yesterday"" and ""today."" This is my position. I'm eternal, but because last night I was covered by dreaming, therefore I say ""yesterday"" and ""today."""
Devotee,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, if material nature is the absence ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then where is material? I've heard you say that once before...",Prabhupāda," There is no material. Yes? If you continueKṛṣṇaconsciousness, there's nothing material. Just like when we offer this flower inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, is it material?"
Devotees,No.,Prabhupāda," You still can accept anything material? No. So how it becomes? It was material in the tree and it becomes spiritual? No. It is spiritual. So long I was thinking it is meant for my enjoyment that is material. As soon as I take it for Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment, it is spiritual."
Paramahaṁsa,"So, actually this entire world is spiritual.",Prabhupāda," Yes. That we want, that engage everything in Kṛṣṇa's service. This will be spiritual world."
Paramahaṁsa,"So we can also appreciate Kṛṣṇa's creation in that light? For example, this is very beautiful because it is Kṛṣṇa's.",Prabhupāda," Yes. We realize that. We don't say... Just likeMāyāvādīphilosophy saysmithyā. Jaganmithyā.""This world is false."" We don't say that. We don't say""jaganmithyā."""
Devotee,This material nature is just one energy ofKṛṣṇaacting in a certain way?,Prabhupāda," Why shall I say...?Kṛṣṇahas created so many nice things for His enjoyment, why shall I say,""mithyā."" Suppose if you create nice house, very good apartment and you call me, ""Just see."" And if I say, ""It is allmithyā."""
Paramahaṁsa,That's also an offense. Because I can't enjoy it.,Prabhupāda," (laughing) Then how much depressed you'll be. Let's say I brought this friend and this rascal is saying, ""This ismithyā."""
Karandhara,Sour grapes.,Prabhupāda," That is explained thatasatyamapratiṣṭhaṁte, jagad āhuranīśvaram[Bg.16.8].These rascals, these demons they say like that, that this isasatya,this is untruth. There is no cause. There is noīśvara.This is the demoniac declaration. IfKṛṣṇais fact, His creation is fact. His energy is fact. Why shall I say false? We don't say it is false. The Māyāvādīs say it is false."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,"If someone looks at the Deity ofKṛṣṇaand thinks it's only stone or wood, for him it's still material?",Prabhupāda," That is his ignorance. How it can be material? The stone is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like electricity energy is there everywhere. The electrician knows how to utilize it, how to take electricity. Similarly,Kṛṣṇais everywhere, even in the stone. The devotees know how to utilize stone to appreciateKṛṣṇa. The devotees know. The rascal, they do not know. Because the devotee has no other view thanKṛṣṇa. Why stone should be withoutKṛṣṇa? Here isKṛṣṇa. That is real oneness. And theMāyāvādīphilosopher they say oneness, but divide. This is stone, this is notKṛṣṇa. Why second? Why you bring another thing?"
Devotee,"Good and bad, evil and...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,Is it so for aKṛṣṇaconscious man thatKṛṣṇais as much in the stone as in the Deity?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Paramahaṁsa,Just as much?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not?
Paramahaṁsa,But we ordermūrtisall the way from India?,Prabhupāda," That is stated that, ""Everything is in Me but I'm not there."" This isacintya-bheda...mayātatamidaṁsarvaṁjagadavyakta-mūrtinā,mat-sthānisarva-bhūtāninacāhaṁ teṣvavasthitaḥ[Bg.9.4].Everything isKṛṣṇabut you cannot worship this bench asKṛṣṇa. That is rascaldom."
Karandhara,"Kṛṣṇasays, ""Worship me in this way.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. (pause) Just like the sunshine. That is also sun. Is it not? But you cannot say when the sunshine is in the room, you cannot say, ""The sun is my room."" This is calledacintya-bhedābheda."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Acintyabheda...?,Prabhupāda," Acintya-bhedābheda,simultaneously one and different."
Paramahaṁsa,But still you said one can seeKṛṣṇawithin the stone.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Why not?
Paramahaṁsa,And one can worship Him within the stone or within everything.,Prabhupāda," Yes. We worship everything. We worship everything, seeKṛṣṇaeverywhere. We don't see the tree. We see Kṛṣṇa's energy. Therefore the tree's also worshipable becauseKṛṣṇaand Kṛṣṇa's energy both are worshipable. Therefore we sayHareKṛṣṇa.Haremeans Kṛṣṇa's energy. We worship everything. In our childhood we are taught by our parents, if there is small grain and if it is strut (?) on the feet, we shall pick it up and touch on the forehead. We are taught like this, how to see everything in relationship withKṛṣṇa. That isKṛṣṇaconscious. We cannot therefore see anything wasted, anything misused. Why you are preaching? Why we are after so many rascals? That his life is being misused. Let us give him some enlightenment. This is our mission. Or let him go to hell. Just likeMāyāvādīsannyāsīs,they're engaged in meditation or in the Himalayas, but we have come to Los Angeles. Why? This is our mission. Oh, these things, these people are being misused undermāyā,let him gain some enlightenment. This is our mission. We are teaching that, how to utilize everything forKṛṣṇa. How to understandKṛṣṇain everything. That is our mission. SeeKṛṣṇain everything.Yomāṁpaśyatisarvatra.Everything is there inBhagavad-gītā,why don't you read?Sarvaṁcamayipaśyati, yomāṁpaśyatisarvatra,""Anyone who sees Me everywhere andsarvaṁcamayipaśyati...and everything in Me, he's perfect."""
Karandhara,"Prabhupāda, we should return to the car.",Prabhupāda," All right.Yomāṁpaśyati...(pause) Thekarmīs,they are thinking, ""Everything for me."" Thejñānīsthey are thinking, ""Why shall I be implicated in this material things?"" And we say that there is nothing material. Dovetail everything withKṛṣṇa. In theBhagavad-gītāit is said,māṁcayo 'vyabhicāreṇabhakti-yogenasevate,saguṇānsamatītyaitānbrahma-bhūyāyakalpate[Bg.14.26].""Anyone who is engaged in devotional service, he's immediately promoted to the transcendental platform,brahma."" He becomesbrahma.Now, somebody may say, ""Oh, we see he has got the same body, how he has becomebrahma?"" And howKṛṣṇasays, ""Yes, he has already becomebrahma."" How to adjust?"
Paramahaṁsa,Like the flower.,Prabhupāda," Yes. The same thing. Yes. As soon as everything is understood inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, that isbrahma-bhūta[SB4.30.20]stage. That is liberated stage. Everything is created byKṛṣṇa. Everything is meant forKṛṣṇa. Everything should be engaged forKṛṣṇa. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness life. That is perfect life. Somebody asked me, ""Why you have come to this country?"" It is not your country. I've not come to your country, I've come to Kṛṣṇa's country. (laughter)"
Devotee,We are trespassing.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Why shall I come to your country. I've come to Kṛṣṇa's country.
Śukadeva,"Prabhupāda, there are many impersonalists in Seattle. We have many universities and I'd like to go there and try and defeat them. But sometimes I forget, I cannot remember the scriptures, so what would be the best clue to always defeat them?",Prabhupāda," Well, if you understand the philosophy without scripture, you can convince them. You can give so many examples."
SvarūpaDāmodara; Karandhara,"The weather is getting worse, Śrīla Prabhupāda.; It will get worse when you leave, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," When I will... It will get better, as soon as I go away. (devotees sigh)"
Karandhara,No. No.,Prabhupāda," It will get..., that is natural. It will not stay. But I'm not going out for this weather, don't misunderstand me. My physicians asked me, therefore... I'm accustomed to this... (end)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They find it very hard to see the spirit, the soul in... It is very doubtful, they say.",Prabhupāda," No, no, spirit you see or don't see, that is dif..."
Umāpati,He studies matter.,Prabhupāda," No, that's all right."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No, once they see the spirit soul, they can detect somehow, then they are definitely convinced.",Prabhupāda," So how you can see? It is... The measurement is given, 1/10,000th part of the tip of the hair. So where is your seeing power?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Still they want to sense it by some...,Prabhupāda," Sense, that is... Any rascal can sense that here is living energy. That is spirit soul. Just like if you inject one grain of poison and immediately he dies, does it require how he dies? That one, not one grain. Even one hundredth part of one grain, venomous poison, how it acts? So even nobody can see it, when the snake bites, nobody can see where is that... How he dies?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They will explain that by..., it blocks some of the metabolic paths...",Prabhupāda," That's all right, but it is acting. That is my point. You can explain in your nonsense way, this, so many things. But I see that because that very little portion of poison is there, immediately he dies. Why don't you see the action?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Just like taking cyanide. Cyanide, they say cyanide blocks the...",Prabhupāda," Whatever it may be, but the thing, we have to see by the effect. Similarly, if the small particle of... Therefore our knowledge is perfect. We take it fromVedas.The small particle of soul, because it is present there, you will see the whole thing is going on nicely."
Karandhara,"But they say the soul is subject to material conditions. They are seeing the body as the soul; so they say because it is subject to material conditions, therefore it's not eternal.",Prabhupāda," No, no. Maybe material conditions, that is... But soul you have to accept there is soul."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Once they accept the existence of the soul, then there is not much difficulty. Once they accept this, then automatically they have to accept.",Prabhupāda," No, they have to accept. They have no explanation. All they explain foolishly. How the man is living, how there is consciousness, he cannot explain.Avināśitutadviddhiyenasarvamidaṁtatam.Consciousness, because the soul is there, if I pinch here, immediately I feel, I am conscious. Throughout the whole skin, I am conscious. Actually the soul is not there. If you cut it, chop it, nobody protests. Why this simple thing they do not understand?"
Paramahaṁsa,"That's the soul, Prabhupāda, but about God...",Prabhupāda," First of all let us understand the soul. Soul is the, a small God, sample God. If you understand the sample, then you can understand the whole thing."
Umāpati,"Some scientists are claiming that just because they haven't yet discovered how to create life, they are soon to, and...",Prabhupāda, What is that?
Umāpati,They are in the process of trying to create life.,Prabhupāda," That is rascaldom. That we kick out. That we kick on their face. You show what you have got just now. That we don't accept, that ""We are trying.""A rascal will say, ""I am trying to be millionaire."" When you become millionaire, then talk. Now you are a poor vagabond. That's all. That we shall accept. What... You are trying. Everyone will say, ""I am trying."" What you are now? That is our proposition."
Paramahaṁsa,. At the present they know how to kill very good.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Nonsense. ""We are trying."" That any nonsense will say, ""I am trying."" What is this? That is not a scientific proposition."
Umāpati,"Well, the argument that has been presented is that ""Well we don't have it now, but soon we're to have it. So...""",Prabhupāda," That any rascal will say. What is the difference between you and the rascal? Any rascal will say, that ""I am trying to..."" What is the use of these scientists? Any rascal will say. Trust no future, however pleasant. You can talk of all pleasant things in future, but you don't trust it. You as you don't trust, because you do not see soul, you don't trust. Why shall I trust you, you rascal, that in future you shall be very great scientist? You do not trust because you do not see. There is no soul. You cannot see. So why shall I trust you? What is the answer? That in future you will be able to do something extraordinary. Why shall I trust you?"
Umāpati; Karandhara,"Give them a lot of credit.; Well they say they have done so much in the past, they have accomplished so much in the past.",Prabhupāda," That is all useless. What you have done? You have not given any contribution that there will be no death. The death is there. In the past there was death, and people are dying now. What you have done?"
Paramahaṁsa,Helped death.,Prabhupāda," Helped means you have helped to minimize their duration of life. Formerly man was living hundred years. Now they do not live more than sixty, seventy years. That you have helped certainly. What you have helped? A man is dying ordinarily, and you have created atomic energy. You can kill thousands of men. So you have helped only in dying. But you have not helped in living. That is not possible. Then what you have done? Some childish play? What you have done? You cannot stop death, you cannot stop birth, you cannot stop disease, you cannot stop old age. So what you have done? Formerly people used to become old. Now also, they are becoming old. Formerly people used to die. They are dying now also. Formerly the people used to become diseased. They are becoming diseased. More diseased. More medicine. What you have helped? You have not helped anything in the improvement of the order of the world? What is that help?"
Umāpati,"The same scientists will point to India and say, ""Look at all the dying and starving people over there.""",Prabhupāda," No, no, why Indians? We are talking of the whole world. Why you take the example of the Indians? Indians may be backward. We are talking of you, so forward. What you have done? Indians may be backward. We are not talking of any particular nation or particular people. We are talking of general people, people in general. India, why bring India?"
Umāpati,"Well, it's the popular opinion over here that Indians are...",Prabhupāda," No, no, why do you bring? This is another foolishness. Why do you bring India? What you have done first of all, sir?"
Umāpati,"Well, I am not doing this.",Prabhupāda," No no, you are your men. Those who are not Indian."
Paramahaṁsa,"Well, perhaps it's because spiritual culture originates, spiritual culture is, permeates their society.",Prabhupāda," Yes, that is. When spiritual consciousness is presented in truth, then you become conquered. You have been already. The Christian people are astonished, howKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement so big shape within so few years. They are afraid now. Yes. And why they shall not be? Here is science. And that is foolishness only."
Umāpati,That's their new religion.,Prabhupāda," Yes. ""God has only one son."" Why? God one son? I asked the priest, that ""God is limited or unlimited?"" ""Oh, unlimited."" ""Then why should you limit it by one son?"" He could not answer. ""Ordinary men have more than one son, and God has got only one son."" Why? He could not answer. There is no philosophy. How people will...? This system, religion, was taught thousands of years, some shepherds, some fourth-class men. And now people are so much advanced in science, why they will accept it? Jesus Christ is preaching first thing, ""Thou shalt not kill."" That means he was preaching among the killers. So what kind of men they are? Tenth class of men. And how this tenth class man religion will be acceptable by the first class men? Now people are becoming first-class men. These things are go on, dogmas and nonsense philosophy. That will not stand. Automatically Christian religion is dead now. Nobody is going. There is no philosophy. There is no science. How it will be accepted. And they are violating, simply violating. Whatever it may be. Christ says ""Thou shalt not kill."" They are simply killing. How it will go on? How long you can cheat people? What is the explanation there? The first order is ""Thou shalt not kill."" Why they are killing? What is the answer?"
Umāpati,Sense gratification.,Prabhupāda, That's all. Violating.
Paramahaṁsa,They have lost respect as well.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Violating the laws. So how they can go on with the business?
Umāpati,Somehow they think they have an answer.,Prabhupāda," They have no answer. As soon as I asked this question... Yesterday also, last, that television, he also asked the same question. He has purchased all our books. So ""Why this Christian religion is declined?"" And ""Why it will not? Why you are violating?"" He could not answer. He could not answer. He will violate... All, many Christian priests ask me this question, and as soon as they put this question, they stop. They stop. They cannot answer. ""Why you are killing? The first order is 'Thou shalt not kill,' and why you are killing?"" They cannot answer. I asked them two questions. ""Why unlimited God shall have only one son? And why you are killing?"" They cannot answer. Or you answer?"
Umāpati,No.,Prabhupāda," The earth was flat. They believed that the world is flat. So how much imperfect knowledge they have got. So imperfect knowledge, how long it can go? Just like we are going to challenge all these rascals that life is grown out of matter. We are going to challenge. It is not a fact. So how long you can cheat people? For hundred, two hundred, thousand years, but you cannot cheat for all the time."
Umāpati,It has been going on from time immemorial. I guess they figure they can just keep going on for time immemorial.,Prabhupāda," No time immemorial. You are being cheated for two hundred, three hundred years, that's all. Not before that. All these scientists rascals, have come out within two hundred years. That's all. So you are being cheated for the last two hundred years, not for thousands of years. So it will be finished. Within another fifty years, everything will be finished."
Karandhara,"Yes, they say now there is ananti-intellectual movement. People are rebelling to science and modern progress.",Prabhupāda, What is that science? That is not science. That is ignorance. Ignorance. Simply ignorance. Ignorance is going as science. Irreligion is going as religion. So how long it will go? People are becoming intelligent.
Paramahaṁsa,"InNewsweek Magazine-it's the largest magazine in the United States—there was an article about the degradation of Christianity, and they summarized it with a cartoon, a picture of the devil, you knowmāyā.This is their image ofmāyā.And he was causing earthquakes. There was a very large earthquake in South America. It killed many thousands of people. So they attribute this tomāyā.And right next to them was a picture of Richard Nixon, because he is a very famous, you know... He presents himself as a follower of Christ. And he's bombing Southeast Asia.",Prabhupāda," ""Thou shalt not kill."""
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah. And the devil turned to Richard Nixon and said, ""It's hell keeping up with Christians.""",Prabhupāda," (laughs) Yes, people will criticize like that. People are becoming advanced. How long you can cheat them with so-called science, so-called religion? Now you take up thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement seriously. He will give real thing. Try to understand.Yasminvijñātesarvamevaṁvijñātaṁbhavati(MuṇḍakaUpaniṣad1.3).If you simply understandKṛṣṇa, everything will be known to you. This is the process. If you simply understandKṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇais explaining Himself in theBhagavad-gītā—you know everything. You know everything. And that is the Vedic injunction,Yasminvijñātesarvamevaṁvijñātaṁbhavati:""By knowingKṛṣṇaonly, you know everything."" That science you try to understand and preach; people will be happy. Now, our question was that we say that the man... I say man. Other living entities, they are also living entities. So in Christian religion also, they say, ""The man is made after God."" Is it not?"
Paramahaṁsa,"""In the image of God.""",Prabhupāda," So man is the sample of God. So why don't you try, study nicely man, and you can know, understand God, what is God. I asked these Christian people, ""If man is made after the image of God, you study very scrutinizingly a perfect human being, and you will know what is God."""
Umāpati,The most ideal image of a human being is God.,Prabhupāda," Yes. That is the Vedic injunction.Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām(KaṭhaUpaniṣad2.2.13).So you take a perfect man. Just likeKṛṣṇa, you take a perfect man, take him as man, you see that He is God. He has got all the perfections. Even if you take him as a man."
Paramahaṁsa,No competition.,Prabhupāda," No competition. That isBhagavān.Bhagavānmeans... We are giving this definition.Bhagavānmeans a perfect man. That's all. Now, just like man wants to wife, to have wife. So why there is, what is called, adulteration? He wants more than one wife. Just see, perfectKṛṣṇa, He has got sixteen thousand wives, which you cannot imagine. Here is perfection. You cannot say that a man has no inclination to have more than one wife. That is there. So that propensity is, in perfection, is there inKṛṣṇa. Therefore He is God."
Umāpati,They refer to it as the Don Juan complex.,Prabhupāda," Juan complex, what is that?"
Umāpati,"It's a character in Spanish history, fictional history. The perfect lover, the image that all men would like to be, the perfect lover.",Prabhupāda," Yes. So who can be perfect lover thanKṛṣṇa?Kṛṣṇa, He loves everyone. Where is that man, he loves everyone? The so-called patriot, they love their countrymen, but kill their animals. Why? Mr. Nixon loves his countrymen. Why not love his country cows? They are also born in the land. They require also. They have right to live, so why they are killed? That is imperfection. AndKṛṣṇais embracing the calf, come on, and embracing Rādhārāṇī also. That is perfection. That is perfection.Kṛṣṇatalks with birds. These are there. One day on the bank ofYamunāHe was talking with a bird. One old lady saw and said, ""Oh, He's talking with a bird?"" That is perfection."
Paramahaṁsa,"He sounded like this? He talked like that, like the birds talk?",Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another quality isbahubhāṣājñaḥ,He can speak in any language."
Umāpati,Birds have language? Animals have their language?,Prabhupāda, Oh yeah everyone has language. Everyone.
Umāpati,"Father, how is it that we can enjoy this energy we are in, Kṛṣṇa's energy now, and we acknowledge it as Kṛṣṇa's in the neophyte stage. A pure devotee realizes it as Kṛṣṇa's energy, but as a neophyte, how do we enjoy material energy in this aspect, the fresh air and the morning walk.",Prabhupāda," A neophyte or anyone who is not inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he does not enjoy. He simply suffers. There is no question of enjoyment. Anyone who is not inKṛṣṇaconsciousness, he does not enjoy. He simply suffers. But he takes the suffering as enjoyment. That ismāyā.That ismāyā.Just like in your country, they are working day and night. Just like from the morning, gugugugugugugugugu (makes noise of machine that is on nearby) They are suffering, but the people are coming, enjoying golf. That is suffering only. From the morning, going here, is it not suffering? (laughter) But he's thinking, ""I am enjoying."" This ismāyā."
Umāpati,Just like the doctor's...,Prabhupāda," Yes. This ismāyā.He is suffering, but he's thinking I am enjoying. So any conditioned soul, he doesn't enjoy anything. He simply suffers. But he thinks that he is enjoying. Therefore the camel, camel example is given. Camel example. Camel, he is eating his own blood, eating thorns, and the thorns cutting the tongue, and from the tongue, blood is oozing out. So when the blood is mixed up with the thorny twigs, it becomes little tasteful, and he is thinking ""Oh, it is very nice."" Similarly, all thesegṛhasthas,enjoying sex life, he is discharging his own blood, he's becoming weaker and weaker, he is thinking, ""I am enjoying."" He is thinking, ""I am enjoying."" And if he uses more, then he becomes diseased, tuberculosis. He is dying by that process, but he's thinking, ""I am enjoying."" Therefore it is example for the camel. He is enjoying his own blood by discharging. One drop of semen is made out of so many drops of blood. Do you know?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Forty drops.,Prabhupāda," Just see. And how many, how much drops of semen he is discharging... That means he's spoiling his blood. But he is thinking, ""I am enjoying."" Would you like to, by giving your blood to enjoy? Would you like?"
Umāpati,"No, I don't think I'd like.",Prabhupāda," But you are doing that, every night. And that is calledmāyā."
Umāpati,"I'm abrahmacārī,Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," No, you are...(laughter) I am giving an example. This is going on. He is going to die. He has adopted a process by which he will die, and he thinks that he is enjoying. This is calledmāyā.Māyāmeans things which is not,māyā.Māmeans not,yāmeans this. ""What you are thinking, it is not that."" That is calledmāyā.So they are inmāyāmeans, they are thinking, these rascals, they are thinking, improving, becoming happy, advancing thismāyāword will finish everything,mā,yā:""Not this.""Bhāgavatasays that ""You are thinking you are becoming victorious, but you are being defeated.""Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātaḥ.These rascal,abodha-jātaḥ,born fools and rascal, they are becoming defeated in every step.Parābhavas tāvadabodha-jātoyāvannajijñāsataātma-tattvam.So long he does not inquire about his self, ""What I am,"" he is simply being defeated. That's all. This is the verdict."
Umāpati,Walking further into the cave.,Prabhupāda," He's working foolishly like animal. He does not know what is soul, what he is, nothing of the sort. He is working hard day and night and he is thinking, ""I am becoming victorious."" This is calledmāyā.What victory? Have you won victory over birth, death, the real problem? ""No. We have won victory. We can now, without horse, we can go with a car."" So what is that? With a horse or without horse, you cannot go anywhere else. You will be here within this world. That's all. Just like these rascals, now they have invented car. You know that? Formerly they were walking."
Karandhara,Yes. Now he is pulling car.,Prabhupāda," That's all. What is that? That within he's..., that golf area. (Apparently, a man is mowing grass on a machine in the background) That's all. (laughing) You know the cow? The cow is stuck up with a pole in India and long rope, and he's thinking, ""I am free."""
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,They have made a longer rope.,Prabhupāda," Yes. And he is thinking, ""I am so free."" Is not? This rascaldom is going on."
Paramahaṁsa,"The one who wroteParadise Lost,Milton, he also wrote a poem which said that, ""A working man is nothing but a devil's slave.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, that's it."
Paramahaṁsa,"""He works so hard for his money, but not his life can he save.""",Prabhupāda," No, what he will do with the money? He will satisfy his senses, that's all."
Paramahaṁsa,So he sells his life.,Prabhupāda, So he's servant of the senses.
Umāpati,He sells his energy...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Umāpati,"Kṛṣṇa's energy that is in him,māyā'senergy.",Prabhupāda," [break] ...transmigration of soul. Suppose this time I am very great scientist, and next life I become a tree like this. What is my advancement? Stand up for ten thousand years. What is the advancement?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Going backwards.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Going to hell, that's all. You are trying to be naked; nature will say, ""Yes, you stand here naked for ten thousand years."" Yes. That is the punishment for being naked. Human life is not meant for becoming naked. That is according to Vedic civilization a great sin. You see. So their, their propensity they are increasing to become naked like our George... What's his name? Lennon, Lennon. So next time he is going to be tree, stand up. Otherwise wherefrom the trees come? They cannot explain. You become tree. That's all. Just like theNalakūvara; they were taking bath naked without caring forNārada. All right, you become naked for one hundred years."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"Among the trees also, there are different grades of trees, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda," Oh yes, everywhere different grades. That is God's creation, variety."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"So those trees which bear nice fruits and nice flowers, they are...",Prabhupāda," Yes, they are pious, pious trees. Otherwise why I am taking care of this leaf? Because the flower is there. And who cares for this leaf? Trampling down. As in the human society, there is first-class man, second-class man, third-class man, similarly in every field, first-class, animal also."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Cows.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Useful, giving milk. Most humble, useful. Even after death it is useful. And they are so rascal, they are taking care of the dog, not of the cow. Just see how they are rascals. And they are advanced, civilized. They do not know what is meant by civilization. Now, according to Vedic scripture, cow killing is sinful. It is never written, dog killing is sinful. Generally, any animal you kill, that is sinful. But especially cow killing is sinful.Go-hatya. Go-hatya.And that cow killing is going on by the Christian world, and still, they are religious. What kind of religion? Christian religion says generally, ""Thou shalt not kill."" All... And especially they are killing cows. Generally killing and especially killing. First thing is why they shall kill at all? In America, oh, they have got sufficient food. So much rice, so much wheat, so much oats, fruits, grains and butter and ghee. So why they shall kill? What is the reason?"
Umāpati,Uncontrollable tongue.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Now what is that bird who is killed in Christmas?
Devotees,Turkey.,Prabhupāda," Turkey, you see. Now, Christmas, God's Christmas, Jesus Christ. He said, ""Thou shalt not kill."" But his birthday is observed by killing, killing, killing, killing, killing."
Paramahaṁsa; Karandhara; Paramahaṁsa; Kṛṣṇa-kāntī; Umāpati,"Andham.Hamis also cow, isn't it?; Pig.; Pig. Pig and turkey they have.; Actually, they kill the turkey on Thanksgiving, which is the day that they acknowledge and give thanks to the Lord.; For this great country.",Prabhupāda," For giving them opportunity to kill? And where is the opportunity? The Lord said, ""Thou shalt not kill."" Where do they get the opportunity of killing? That is another blaspheme. Where do they get this opportunity? They manufacture."
Śukadeva,"In Seattle not only do they eat cows, but they run out of cows and they start eating horses. It is very famous now to buy horsemeat. They have horse steaks instead of cow steaks. It has become so degraded now that they are eating horses.",Prabhupāda, Why?
Paramahaṁsa; Śukadeva,They ran out of cows. Cows cost too much.; So now they are killing horses.,Prabhupāda, So now they will eat their old father. Yes. No price. Home made. (laughter) Home made concession.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Paramahaṁsa,"I think it's quite wet, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this side.; Maybe drier over that way.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Anywhere you go.
SvarūpaDāmodara; Paramahaṁsa; SvarūpaDāmodara,"This side is better, actually.; Not only did Christ tell them not to kill, but he also, he himself said that all his disciples were like sheep and animals and he was their herder. So he gave the example that we are all like, we should be like innocent animals. So many examples he gave like that.; I remember this in Pittsburgh last year Śrīla Prabhupāda, in that meeting with the bishops, there was a Christian father, a Catholic father. So the question raised that Śrīla Prabhupāda said, ""Thou shalt not kill,"" in the Bible, in the Commandments.",Prabhupāda," Yes. I was invited by some Christian priest in Melbourne, very good gathering. I said also the same thing."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"I think his answer was ""When the Bible was written, Christ didn't mean this way."" That was his answer.",Prabhupāda," Oh, He used that part. He has found out. The rascal. Beat with shoes, that what ""Christian, Christ could not find out, you have found out. You are so great. Thank you very much. You are more intelligent than Christ. Oh. So why Bible. Why not write your Bible? Let us follow."""
Paramahaṁsa,Generally there are now something like 451 different translations. Just like theGītā.They interpret in so many ways.,Prabhupāda," NoGītā,or... Many translations, but the originalGītāis perfect."
Paramahaṁsa,"Yeah. Well they are not even sure that the Bible is (tape is very distorted) As a matter of fact it's a known fact that so many of the excerpts from Christ's disciples were, how you say, censored. There were parts taken out.",Prabhupāda, Some Bible authorities say that there is no soul of the animal. St. Joseph or something.
Devotee; Karandhara,St. Thomas.; . That was St. Augustine.,Prabhupāda, Just see. How great fool he was. And he's a saint. You see.
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,Well the real in his book (tape distortions),Prabhupāda, Jīvojīvasyajīvanam.
SvarūpaDāmodara,One life is the food of another.,Prabhupāda," Another. That is not the question. That is also science. And this is also science that every living entity has got... (distortions) You eat. That I have already said, but why do you say something which is not fact?"
Devotee,They say what is the difference between an animal and a plant?,Prabhupāda, Maybe different (distortion) difference between you and me. That difference you'll find amongst ourselves. We are all different. But that does not mean I have no soul. Any one of us has soul. (distortions till end of tape)
SvarūpaDāmodara,Inconceivable?,Prabhupāda, Yes. Inconceivable or mystic.
SvarūpaDāmodara,Mystic power.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
SvarūpaDāmodara,"I am just collecting what Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, the differentacintya-śaktisthat we observe.",Prabhupāda," Here theacintya-śaktiis working, this mist, fog. You have no power to drive it away. Beyond your power. You can explain with some juggling of words..."
Passer-by,Good morning.,Prabhupāda," Good morning. ...that ""Such chemicals, such molecules, such this, that,"" there are so many things. But (laughing) you have no power to drive it away."
SvarūpaDāmodara,Yeah. They have no explanation how the mist is formed. They call...,Prabhupāda," That you can do. That is, I can do also. It is not very great credit. But if you know how it is formed, then counteract it."
SvarūpaDāmodara,We know how it is formed.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So you know, then you discover, counteracting. Just like formerly, in the warfare the atomicbrahmāstrawas thrown. On the other side...brahmāstrameans excessive heat. So they caused something, they transformed into water. Because after heat, there must be water. So where is that science?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"It is just like milk. Milk looks white, but it is just water. They call it, it's a colloidal suspension of proteins, these caseins, in water. So similarly, this fog is just a colloidal suspension of water in the air.",Prabhupāda," Yes. So you create some fire. It will be immediately driven away. Water can be driven away by fire. So you create. That you cannot. You just shot one bomb. There will be some heat, and all the mist will go away. Do it."
Karandhara,That would blow up the planet. (laughter),Prabhupāda," HareKṛṣṇa. Water can be counteracted by fire or air. Everyone knows it. So you do it, suspension. So this is for you mystic power. You can talk all nonsense, but you cannot act against it. Therefore it is mystic power. So similarly, there are so many things. That isacintya-śakti.You cannot think of even. By nature's way, immediately the sun rises—no more mist. All finished. A little temperature increase of the sun, all finished.Nīhāramivabhāskaraḥ.This example is given in theBhāgavata.Nīhāra,this is callednīhāra.Just likenīhārais immediately dissipated bybhāskara,by the sun, similarly, if one can awaken his dormant devotion, then all finished, all his reaction of sinful activities, finished.Nīhāramivabhāskaraḥ.You just create... You calculate sun is composition of this chemical, that chemical. Just create one sun and throw it. Simply theoretical future, bluff and juggling of words, that's not good."
SvarūpaDāmodara,That is what the research means. Research means to understand what was not known before.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Research means you admit that you are all fools and rascals. Research meant for whom? Who does not know. Otherwise where is the question of research? You do not know. You admit that. So so many mystic powers are there. You do not know how it is being done. Therefore you have to accept inconceivable power. And without accepting this principle of inconceivable power, there is no meaning of God. Not like thatBala-yogībecame a God. So these are for the rascals, fools. But those who are intelligent, they will stress the inconceivable power. Just like we acceptKṛṣṇaas God—inconceivable power. We acceptRāma—inconceivable power. Not so cheaply. One rascal comes and says, ""I am incarnation of God."" Another rascal accepts. It is not like that. ""Ramakrishna is God."" We do not accept. We must see the inconceivable mystic power. Just likeKṛṣṇa, as a child, lifted a hill. This is inconceivable mystic power.Rāmacandra, He constructed a bridge of stone without pillar. The stone began to float: ""Come on."" So that is an inconceivable power. And because you cannot adjust this inconceivable power, when they are described, you say, ""Oh, these are all stories."" What is called? Mythology. But these great, great sages, Vālmīki and Vyāsadeva and otherācāryas,they simply wasted their time in writing mythology? Such learned scholars? And they have not interpreted that it is mythology. They have accepted it as actual fact. There was forest fire. All the friends and cowherd boys, they became disturbed. They began to see towardsKṛṣṇa: ""Kṛṣṇa, what to do?"" ""All right."" He simply swallowed up the whole fire. This is inconceivable mystic power. That is God.Aiśvarya-vairāgya-yaśo-'vabhodha-vīrya-śriyā.These six opulences in full. That is God. That inconceivable power, inconceivable energy or mystic power, we have got also. Very minute quantity. So many things are going on within our body. We cannot explain. The same example. My nails are coming exactly in the form. Although it is spoiled by disease, again it is coming. I do not know what machinery is going on, and the nail is coming, exactly fitting the position and everything. That is coming from my body. So that is mystic power. Even it is mystic power for me and to the doctors, everyone... They cannot explain."
Kṛṣṇa-kāntī,The doctors are marveling at the complex nature of the human brain. They are amazed.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Yes. But they are rascal. It is not the brain that is working. It is the spirit soul that is working. The same thing: the computer machine. The rascal will think that a computer machine is working. No. The man is working. He pushes the button, then it works. Otherwise, what is the value of this machine? You keep the machine for thousands of years, it will not work. When another man will come, put the button, then it will work. So who is working? The machine is working or the man is working? And the man is also another machine. And it is working due to the presence ofParamātmā,God. Therefore, ultimately, God is working. A dead man cannot work. So how long a man remains living? So long theParamātmāis there,ātmāis there. Even theātmāis there, ifParamātmādoes not give him intelligence, he cannot work.Mattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].God is giving me intelligence, ""You put this button."" Then I put this button. So ultimatelyKṛṣṇais working. Another, untrained man cannot come and work on it because there is no intelligence. And a particular man who is trained up, he can work. So these things are going on. Ultimately comes toKṛṣṇa. What you are researching, what you are talking, that is alsoKṛṣṇais doing.Kṛṣṇais giving you in... You, you prayed for this facility toKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇais giving you. Sometimes you find accidentally the experiment is successful. So whenKṛṣṇasees that you are so much harassed in experimental, ""All right do it."" Just likeYaśodāMāwas trying to tieKṛṣṇa, but she could not do. But whenKṛṣṇaagreed, it was possible. Similarly, this accident meansKṛṣṇahelps you: ""All right, you have worked so hard, take this result."" Everything isKṛṣṇa.Mattaḥsmṛtirjñānamapohanaṁca[Bg.15.15].Everything is coming fromKṛṣṇa."
SvarūpaDāmodara,"They say, ""Kṛṣṇa didn't give me the proper steps how to do the experiments.""",Prabhupāda," Yes, he gives you. Otherwise how you are doing it. Whatever you are doing, that is by Kṛṣṇa's grace. And when you are still favorable, thenKṛṣṇawill give you more facilities.Kṛṣṇawill give you facility, will favor you, as much as you desire, not more than that.Yeyathāmāṁprapadyantetāṁs tathaiva...As much proportionately you surrender toKṛṣṇa, the intelligence will come. If you fully surrender, then full intelligence will come. It is stated in theBhagavad-gītā.Yeyathāmāṁprapadyantetāṁs tathaiva bhajāmyaham[Bg.4.11].Wet? (Asking about the ground)"
SvarūpaDāmodara,"No. Little wet, but not much.",Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇasays, ""You fully surrender. I give you full protection.""Ahaṁtvāṁsarva-pāpebhyomokṣayiṣyāmi[Bg.18.66].He will give you full intelligence. [break] ...these facts inKṛṣṇaconsciousness. That will be our great success when the scientific world will admit. Let them admit simply. Then ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness movement will (be) great success. You simply admit, ""Yes, there is God and mystic power."" Then our movement is very successful. And that's a fact. Simply talking like a nonsense amongst the nonsense, that is not a very great credit.Andhāyathāndhairupanīyamānāḥ[SB7.5.31].One blind man is leading other blind man. What is the value of such? They are all blind. And so long one remains blind and rascal, he does not accept God. This is the test. As soon as we see that he does not accept God, he is blind, rascal, fool, whatever you can call. Take it for granted, however, whatever he may be. He's a rascal. On this principle we can challenge so many big, big chemist, philosopher, whoever comes to us. We say, ""You are demon."" The other chemist came, you brought him, that Indian?"
SvarūpaDāmodara,Hm. Chouri.(?),Prabhupāda," Chouri. (laughing) So I told him that ""You are a demon."" But he was not angry. He admitted. And all his argument was refuted. Perhaps you remember."
