Devotee (1),Yes.,Prabhupāda," But generally, unless they are very highly elevated... [break] ...to elevate them,harijanas."
Devotee (1),Harijanas.,Prabhupāda, But he did not know how to make themharijana.He was politically trying. These are old garments?
Devotee (1),No. New.,Prabhupāda, They are selling new.
Devotee (1),"Yes. This is a very well attended market, this area.",Prabhupāda, Yes. I can see. When the market opens?
Devotee (1),About 9 o'clock or 9:30. Then they open until 1(2):30 and close all afternoon. All over Jakarta they close all afternoon and at five o'clock then they open...,Prabhupāda, And go then up to 10:00.
Devotee (1); Devotee (2); Devotee (1): ,"8:30.; It's a good system in a country with this weather, very hot in the afternoon, to close the business in the mid-day. (indistinct); Some type of military school. Looks like naval.",Prabhupāda, this road is very nice. (indistinct) What is meaning oftoko?
Devotee (1); Devotee (2),"Tokomeans store, shop.; If they say bookstore, they saytoko booko.",Prabhupāda, Toko simara? Toko simara?
Devotee (1),Maybe that's one particular store. Usually they say what type of store.Toko sapatermeans shoe store.,Prabhupāda, Sapato?
Devotee (1),Sapatu.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Yes.Sapato.
Devotee (1),Toko bungameans flower store. They usually have the category. (pause),Prabhupāda, These are wholesale merchants?
Devotee (1),It appears to be. Yes.,Prabhupāda, It is just like Indian market.
Devotee (1),Oh.,Prabhupāda," In India also... Similarly, I've seen Philippines also like this. Japanese almost like this."
Devotee (1),Yes. I was there also.,Prabhupāda, Tokyo.
Devotee (1),In Malaysia also (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," These are all oriental countries. Five thousand years ago this whole planet was India,Bhārata-varṣa. That we get from history,Mahābhārata.This planet name isBhārata-varṣa."
Devotee (2),"After KingParīkṣit, then it divided up, that soon after?",Prabhupāda," Divided? They are also already divided. But the culture diminished. Because the center of culture was India, Delhi. So as the power diminished, the maintenance of the culture diminished, and by contact with other types of aboriginal, they learned eating meat and gradually degraded. And they discovered different kinds of religion because... Just like at the present moment Christians are protesting why there should not be abortion. So they wanted to degraded. So the Indian culture did not allow, so the separate type of religion came out. This is the (indistinct). They wanted, ""Why there should not be meat-eating?"" But Indian culture would not allow, so they become Mohammedans, they become Christians, like this. Even in India all the..., what are these Mohammedans? The Mohammedans, they are lower class men, less thanśūdra.But Hindus, higher class, they would not touch it. But when the Mohammedans, that we will be on equal right, they, there is a (indistinct)."
Devotee (1),So there's no spiritual motive.,Prabhupāda," Later on it became political, because as soon as the spiritual power, culture become diminished, the whole thing became material. So people wanted material advantage, so separated from Vedic culture. Just like Buddhists. Buddhism was aHinduculture. But LordBuddhawanted to stop animal sacrifice. In theVedas,animal sacrifice is recommended under certain conditions. He even denied that, ""No that also cannot be done."" So therefore they are separate from Vedic culture. After all these, all these religious systems-Mohammedanism, Jewism, then Christianism, Buddhism—they are at a stage not more than 2,000 years. And before 2,000 years, what was the culture?"
Devotee (1),"The Christians here, get money from America. InBali, where there's many Hindus live, they convert many people by saying, ""If you become a Christian, you'll have good economy with us.""",Prabhupāda, And that is the Christian propaganda.
Devotee (1),Same in Madras.,Prabhupāda," In India, everywhere. They cannot attract people by their philosophy. It is show money, ""Yes, come on, take money."" (pause) Hong Kong also. [break] Very, many meat shops. Rather this vegetable,..."
Devotee (1),It's expensive.,Prabhupāda, Eh?
Devotee (1); Devotee (2); Devotee (1),"It costs a lot of money. Meat is more expensive to eat. Actually, most people, mostly they eat vegetables because it is available. But there's much fish. There's much fish and they carry around in the streets everywhere.; In the Eastern countries usually people eat little bits of meat but they're vegetable. It's only in the West that they eat steak. But in every restaurant, they all have meat, much chicken also. They raise chickens. (pause); Tomorrow morning we have asked some Indian community leaders to come about 7 o'clock, because they want to be requested by you to do something to help make a temple or what you like. But they... Apparently they feel unhappy because we have not met with the leaders and asked them to help.",Prabhupāda, Why should I put the question? They should first of all. They should come forward.
Devotee (1),"Well, actually that meeting with the Indians they wanted you to eat someprasādamin the room, and come inside, and request, and ask you like that.",Prabhupāda," No, no. I cannot do that."
Devotee (1); Devotee (2); Devotee (1); Devotee (2),"That was before that night they want... I think...; No, he doesn't understand...; The night that, the first gathering at the Indian man's home, they all wanted to meet with you then butAmoghadidn't know that. They were planning to come in the room and offer their services. But there was some mix-up, and they didn't understand. They thought they had been cut off.; They told me they wanted you to go in the room forprasādam.But they wanted a meeting and they didn't tell me. I didn't know.",Prabhupāda," I can request them. But if they deny that will be insult for me. Therefore I do not like to request them. That will be not good for them, if I request and then they deny, or they do not do. That is not that will be good for them. It is better not to request. That will be offense, if they deny. Or if they did not carry out my order, then it will be offense. Why should they put themselves in such risk? Generally it is the duty of the householder to offer, ""Sir, what can I do for you?"" Then I can request. But if, as a beggar, I request them and they deny, then that will be great offense for them. That will not good for them."
Devotee (2); Devotee (1),(indistinct); We are almost there.,Prabhupāda, So you wanted to secure place here?
Devotee (1),"Yes. They have a house in this area, but it is a bit far from the center of town.",Prabhupāda," Never mind. It is good quarter, you can take it."
Devotee (1),O.K. It is about onemilemore though.,Prabhupāda, That doesn't matter.
Devotee (1),O.K.,Prabhupāda, This is also a center. It is congested.
Devotee (1),Yes. It is near a bus station also.,Prabhupāda, Oh. (end)
Śrīdhara; Śrīdhara; Prabhupāda:Jayao; Śrīdhara,"Room Conversation withMahārāja—March 17, 1973, Māyāpur; Mahārāja:HareKrsna,HareKrsna. So, our SwamiMahārājahas done a miracle! (Laughingly) He has done a miracle. What Bhaktivinoda conceived and [SrilaBhaktisiddhanta Saraswati] Prabhupada tried according to his conception to translate into action we find that through SwamiMahārājain his last days these revelations have been fulfilled. We are happy, we are glad, we are proud of SwamiMahārāja, and of you all too. When any person comes to takediksaand stay at the Math, we say that after wandering for a long time in a foreign land he is again coming back to his home. Home means homeward, back to God ""back to home, back to Godhead."" Back to Godhead means back to home, sweet, sweet home. Our home and life is there and nowhere else. So we may be quite free there of any misgivings or misconduct with such bold and clear faith we can go on, onward and onward.HareKrsna,HareKrsna.Vāñchā-kalpatarubhyaścakṛpā-sindhubhyaevaca....; ṁ viṣṇupādaparamahaṁsaparivrājakācārya....So we are thinking we are very much fortunate to hear His Divine Grace Oṁ ViṣṇupādaParamahaṁsaParivrājakācāryaBhaktiRaksakaŚrīdharaMahārāja. He is, by age and experience, in both ways he is senior to me. I am also always fortunate to have his association for a very long timeperhaps since nineteen hundred and thirty or something like that. At that time, he did not acceptsannyāsa; he just left home, vanaprastha. In his white dress he went to Allahabad. (Aside, to ŚrīdharaMahārāja:)Mahārāja, I think you remember this incident when you went to Allahabad.; Mahārāja: Yes, I do.",Prabhupāda," Yes, thank you. Yes, at that time..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: We tookprasādamon the roof.,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes, thank you (devotees laugh). Yes. In that auspicious occasion we are connected. Before that, in 1920, ah 22, when I was manager in Dr. Bose's laboratory, young man, and I was nationalist, Congress party. I was a devotee ofMahatmaGandhiand C.R.Dāsa. At that time..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: When I was (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: That was the beginning of our...,Prabhupāda," No, I was in connection with Congress (?) in 1917."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: Seventeen.,Prabhupāda," Yes, 17, when Anivesan (?) became the Congress president, yes. Then I became serious in 1920, and I gave up my education. So one of my friends, that friend he is also now, perhaps you knowMahārāja, that Naren Mullik?"
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: Yes, yes.",Prabhupāda," Yes. He was my intimate friend. So in their house, oldTīrthaMahārājawent to beg some alms—they are very rich man. So, he informed me that ""One nicesannyāsīcame to our house,'' and he was invited, ""in Ultadanga there isGauḍīyaMaṭha, so he has invited me. I wish to go there. Why don't you come? Let us go together."" He was my very intimate friend. So at that time I was a little pessimistic (?), ""I know all thesesādhusthere, I am not going.'' So he forced me, ""Oh, why not come? Let us go.'' ""All right, let us go."" So I went to see His Divine Grace BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatīṬhākura in 1922 in that Ultadanga building, and that time Prabhupāda was sitting on the roof. There was small house (indistinct) room, and we were welcome, because they thought Naren Mullik was very rich man and he has contributed some money. So, we went to see Prabhupāda, offered our obeisances. So immediately he said that ""You are all educated young men, why don't you preach LordCaitanyaMahāprabhu's message throughout the whole world?'' So I replied him, ""Sir, we are dependent nation, who will hear our message? We can talk all these things after we get independence,'' because I was politically-minded at that time. So he refuted my argument. Certainly I was defeated, and I took his words very seriously, I appreciated. Then we were offered someprasādam, we came down, and my friend Naren Mullik asked me, ""How did you like thissādhu?'' ""Yes, here is asādhuin whose handsCaitanyaMahāprabhu's message is there, and it will be done. I think this is very nice.'' That was my appreciation. Then 1923, I resigned my post as manager in Bose's laboratory, and I accepted the agency of whole U.P., beginning from Mughalsarai (?) up to Delhi, and I made my head office in Allahabad. So I was always thinking, ""Oh yes, I met a very nicesādhu.'' From the very beginning, that was my impression, that ""I have met a realsādhu."" So, actually the words,lavamātrasādhusaṅgesarvasiddhihaya[Cc.Madhya22.54], was actually... I perceived a kind (?) for a moment, and he impressed so much, BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatīṬhākura, that it was, it continued. Then in 1928, when there wasKumbha-melā...Mahārāja, when you joinedGauḍīyaMaṭha?"
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: Twenty-seven.,Prabhupāda, Twenty-seven. That means...
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: (in background, indistinct)",Prabhupāda," So 1928 there was aKumbha-melā, I think. And during thatKumbha-melā,TīrthaMahārājawith a party came to my shop, Prayāg pharmacy, all of a sudden, and I thought, ""Oh, these are the people I saw,GauḍīyaMaṭha. Yes.'' So, I was so glad. SoTīrthaMahārājaasked me that ""We are come new here. We are going to establish a temple in Allahabad. We have heard your name, so we have come to you. Please help us.'' ""Yes, I will help you.'' So in this way I contributed, my attending physician contributed, and some other friends. In this way we became friends, andTīrthaMahārāja, oldTīrthaMahārājahad first meeting in my house at Allahabad, with I think the Sarvesva (?)brahmacārīandDhīraKṛṣṇabrahmacārī..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct)Mahārājaand (indistinct)Mahārāja.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. So, my father wasVaiṣṇava, but when I invited theseGauḍīyaMaṭhasādhus, my father thought that I have invited somesādhusof the Ramakrishna Mission. So he was not very interested. WhenTīrthaMahārājais speaking, I call my... My father was that time invalid, I called him that ""Please come down, there is a meeting of theGauḍīyaMaṭhasādhus.'' So, he could not resist my request, he came down, but he did not think that some devotees have come. They thought, these Ramakrishna Mission rascals have come. (laughter) So he was not very happy, but I told, he was sitting. He, so the meeting he just criticized. Then when he heard the speech of our oldTīrthaMahārāja, our old Godbrother, he understood, ""Oh, they are Vaiṣṇavas.'' Then immediately after the meeting, he came down on his feet. ""I misunderstood you sir, that you are the Ramakrishna Missionsādhu. I am so glad to meet you. So that is the beginning of my intimate relationship withGauḍīyaMaṭha. And they are coming, and whenever somebody would come, I would invite them to lecture in my house. In that way ŚrīdharaMahārāja, at that time Ravendra-sundara(?)Bhaṭṭācārya, he was also invited at my house, and before (indistinct)... No, I think I invitedBhāratīMahārāja, and you were withBhāratīMahārāja."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: Yes.,Prabhupāda," Yes. So in this way my connection became developed withGauḍīyaMaṭha. Then, gradually the process began,hariṣyetad-dhanaṁśanaiḥ. (chuckles) I wanted to become very big businessman and there was good opportunity. I was very nicely associated with the chemical industry of India. Dr. Bose's laboratory, Bengal Chemical, V.K. Farr (?), and all of them, they liked my business organization. Then I started big laboratory in Lucknow. So that was golden days, but gradually everything becomes (indistinct). And at last, my Allahabad business was lost. It was not lost on account of some, my debts, I had to hand it over to Dr. Kartik Chandra Bose because I was his agent. So I had some debts, so I tell the, ""All right, you take this business.'' In this way, that Prayāg Pharmacy was lost. So I was not going to, I was sitting at home, but thisJayaRaghava(?)Mahārāja, at that time Sarvesva (?)brahmacārīand Atulanandabrahmacārī, they used to come to take their subscription, and they were requesting that ""Why don't you come to ourmaṭha?Why don't you come to ourmaṭha?You are now free.'' So, I used to visit their temple. That was not far away from my house..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: In Mahratta (?).,Prabhupāda," Mahratta (?), yes. Then the intimate relationship withGauḍīyaMaṭhagrew. In this way, I think in 1933, yes, the Sir Malcolm Haley came to lay down the foundation stone of AllahabadMaṭha.Mahārāja, I think you remember, yes?"
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: Yes, we were coming fromVṛndāvanaparikrama.",Prabhupāda," Yes,parikrama. And theparikrama, that is also another incident that... I, I was not initiated at that time, but I had very good admiration for theseGauḍīyaMaṭhapeople, and before, before 1933 I met ŚrīdharaMahārājaand other devotees, oldTīrthaMahārāja. So they were kind to me. Now, theparikrama, I thought, ""What these people are doing in thisparikrama?Let me go.'' So I met them in Kosi.ParvataMahārāja, you may remember, and all people were going to see some Sesasayi."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes, so at that time VinodeBhai, later onKeśavaMahārāja, he informed that ""Prabhupāda is going toMathurātomorrow morning and he will speakHari-kathāthis evening. Anyone who wants to remain may remain or otherwise they may prepare to go to see Śeṣaśāyī."" So at that time, I think only ten or twelve men remained. Out of them ŚrīdharaMahārājawas one of them, and I thought it wise, ""What shall I see, this Śeṣaśāyī? Let me hear. Prabhupāda will speak, let me hear."" So Prabhupāda marked that this boy..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct) to listen to him (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," He, because he's avaikuṇṭhaperson who could understand that this boy is eager to hear, so he very much appreciated. So when we came back to Allahabad, soGaneśaBabu, he introduced me, that ""Here is a nice devotee.'' So Prabhupāda immediately replied, ""Yes, I have marked him. He does not go away, he hears.'' This (indistinct), ""Yes, I will accept him as disciple.'' Then I was initiated. In this way our relationship withGauḍīyaMaṭhadeveloped, and gradually as it developed, the other side diminished. Then, there are long history, it will take time, but I had the opportunity of associating with His Holiness. For several years I had the opportunity.Kṛṣṇaand Prabhupāda liked it to prepare me. ŚrīdharaMahārājalived as a..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct),Prabhupāda," (laughs) ...in my house, some may say, a few years, so naturally we had very intimate talks and he was my good adviser. I took his advice, his instruction very seriously, because from the very beginning I know he's a pureVaiṣṇavaand devotee, and I wanted to associate with him, and try to help him also in so many ways. He also tried to help me, so our relationship is very intimate. After the breakdown of theGauḍīyaMaṭha, I wanted to organize another organization, making ŚrīdharaMahārājahead. And I wanted to mix... At that time GosvāmīMahārāja, one of my friend's house at Sealdah... ŚrīdharaMahārāja, you may remember those things. I wanted to organize in so many ways, but somehow or other..."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: I had one house in Station Road belonging to Naren Mullik. (indistinct) very small (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes, he wanted to rent us only for ninety rupees. I told him, ""You just give me the concession. He, at that time he was getting 125, but because I am his friend, ""All right, I'll give you, ninety rupees.'' So that could not happen somehow or other. So I was trying from the very beginning after the disappearance of BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatī."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: First appearance ofBack to Godhead(indistinct).,Prabhupāda," Yes, 1944. I think you were at that time at my house. Yes. So, somehow or other, this intention for preaching the cult ofCaitanyaMahāprabhuincreased and the other side decreased.Viraktiranyatrasyāt. But I was not disinclined, butKṛṣṇaforced me that you must give up. (chuckles) And these thing is known better to ŚrīdharaMahārāja, how it decreased, decreased, decreased, then almost it become nil, and then I left home in 1950. Whatever was there, ""All right, you do whatever you like.'' In 1954, four years I remained asvānaprastha, (indistinct) four years, from 1950 to 1959."
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: In the mean time, Bombay. Bombay light.",Prabhupāda," Bombay light, yes. Bombay light, that is during my householder life. I opened an office in Bombay for my business and... The (indistinct)GauḍīyaMaṭhawas established by us. I am one of them. ŚrīdharaMahārājaalso. And we made two parties for begging, collecting alms. ŚrīdharaMahārāja, myself and GosvāmīMahārāja. That time he wasAtula, Atulacandra Gosvāmī. So I took them to some of my friends, chemist friends, doctors friends. So I collected about five hundred rupees to this. ŚrīdharaMahārājawould speak, I introduced, and Gosvāmī, at that time GosvāmīMahārājawould canvass (laughter). In this way three combined together, in one day or two days we... At that time five hundred rupees was (laughing) big amount."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: Big sum.,Prabhupāda," Big sum, yes. So GosvāmīMahārājavery much appreciated, and he began to speak highly about me that ""AbhayBabuis so expert, he has got so many friends, he has collected so many... So why does he... He should be theMaṭhain-charge."" In this way. ""Why should he not live with us? Why he's living separately?'' In this way. So Prabhupāda,Mahārāja, Śrīdhara may remember it (laughing), he said, ''It is better to live separately from you people, and he will do the necessity in due course of time."" So I could not understand what Śrīla Prabhupāda meant by that. So his inclination, blessings, were always upon me although (indistinct), but he was so kind."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct) collecting sufficient funds to come back (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," Yes, he was afraid."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: He asked you.,Prabhupāda," Prabhupāda gave me some money, that he is afraid, ""You keep this money. When they need you can...'' So, byguruVaiṣṇava, and whatever position I have got it is by guru's mercy and the Vaiṣṇavas' blessings, otherwise I am insignificant. So I wish that ŚrīdharaMahārājamay bestow his blessings as he was doing always, and myGuruMahārājamay help me. I can give some service (?)."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Yes, I thought that (indistinct)GuruMahārājawanted and theseGauḍīyaMath people did not do anything, so let me try in this old age. The inspiration came, and I went. By his grace it has become little successful, that's all. I have no credit. It is all the blessings ofguruandVaiṣṇava, that's all. I have no credit. I do not know how things are happening, because I am not at all bona fide position. But it is trulychāḍiyāvaiṣṇava-sevānistārapāyechekebā."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: Are you going (indistinct) kindly talk with your men (?).,Prabhupāda, Yes.HareKṛṣṇa.
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: That will be (indistinct) to us, the land of gold and GoldenAvatara(indistinct).",Prabhupāda," I am always (indistinct) to this, my American disciples that you are so much, I mean to say, taken care by God (?), this is... Your position is very good. Now you take toKṛṣṇaConsciousness, and you become a perfect nation. That I preach always. By the grace ofKṛṣṇa, you have got everything. All material opulence. Now make it plusKṛṣṇa. Then it will be very nice.Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. So, these boys are trying, very sincerely and seriously, and I hope, even I do not live many more years, they will carry out this order."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct) coming down (indistinct) should be (indistinct),Prabhupāda, And our (indistinct)Mahārāja...
Śrīdhara,"Mahārāja: Prabhupāda said, Bhaktivinoda (Bengali).",Prabhupāda, That he was (indistinct). This is not (indistinct). This is not (indistinct).
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct) we are also counted within that...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Other times being washed awaykeno māyār bośe, jāccho bhese, and we are being washed away by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura (laughter)."
Śrīdhara,Mahārāja: (indistinct) participate.,Prabhupāda," Yes, that's all, everything is there, everything is there. So chantHareKṛṣṇa, again. (people begin leaving)"
Devotee,"Śrīla Prabhupāda, arotika is beginning and I (indistinct) the devotees up to arotika, all of them could go up?",Prabhupāda, All right then. (indistinct) All right chant. (kīrtana-end)
