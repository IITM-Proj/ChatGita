TamālaKṛṣṇa,I think more are coming from Calcutta. Śyāmasundara called me.,Prabhupāda," At least fourkholsyou want to have. Fourkholsand sixteen men, that is party. Yes. And one leading singer and one dancer. That makes complete party. Twenty, twenty-two men. So where is Śyāmasundara?"
Devotee,I didn't find him.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,I didn't find him anywhere.,Prabhupāda, He is not here?Huh? Resting? (background discussion among devotees) He went to bed very late last night?
Devotee (2),(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Hm.
Devotee (2),He was trying to finish the Māyāpur thing.,Prabhupāda," Oh, oh, that's all right. Let him remain. So you can speak some discussion from our books? You can see he is very great speaker,Viṣalaprabhu."
Viṣala,Me?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣala,I cannot speak. (laughter),Prabhupāda, Yes.
Viṣala; TamālaKṛṣṇa,"I've been reading theBrahma-saṁhitā, and uh, by His Divine Grace Śrīla BhaktisiddhāntaSarasvatī, and he mentions that to receive the mercy of..., Kṛṣṇa's mercy, one has to be free of all mundane desires, and also he has to receive the grace of God at the same time. So it's all, it's like the son, he mentions. He doesn't know how wealthy his father is, but by the grace of his father, he says, ""My dear son, I have a lot of money and I..., you will be in my will, and you will have this all and I will give you all these instructions.'' So similarly, by finally gradually becoming free of all mundane desires and completely being influenced by thecitpotency, by the superior cognitive energy of LordKṛṣṇa, one will receive the mercy ofRādhāandKṛṣṇa. But the most important thing is to receive the mercy of the spiritual master, because only by the guru's mercy can one be blessed by God. So that means we have... [break]; He's been reading yourŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamevery morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, Yes.Huh?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"We've been reading Śrīla...,Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.",Prabhupāda," Yes, read."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Should I get a copy of that?,Prabhupāda, Yes. So here is microphone. You did not know? Śrīmatī has brought two microphones.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Oh, yours?",Prabhupāda," Yes, just see."
Devotee (2),There's tapes also.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (2),Some tapes.,Prabhupāda," Oh, that's nice. Yes. Whenever somebody comes from there, something must be brought, because these things are not available. [break] ...Indian, you cannot excel in mechanical knowledge the Europeans, American. That is not possible. We will always remain hundred years back. Everyone has got some special talent given by God. We should cooperate. That's it. The hand can work in this way. We cannot walk with hands. That is the business of the hand. Similarly, I cannot cut the papers with leg. So all living entities are endowed with special... We should cooperate. The hand and leg should cooperate for maintaining the whole body. Similarly, everyone should use his talent for satisfaction ofKṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Not compete with one another. That is mistake."
Devotee (2),(unwrapping package) It's not the microphone.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (2),I don't think it's the microphone. [break],Prabhupāda, They never reply.
Devotee (2),"It's such a big company, they...",Prabhupāda," I do not know what kind of big company, and their publication we do not get in India. Why? (indistinct) We cannot get in Macmillan Company. Sometimes somebody inquires, the reply, ""They..., we have not published this book, this, here.'' They have no information."
Devotee (1),"We can show that one copy of that letter, and what can they do to us?",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee (1),"If they try to stop us from printing, we can show them the copy of that letter that says they do not publish, and then what can they do? We have a copy of...",Prabhupāda," I think we can publish all books here, because the agreement is made inUSA. They have nothing to do within India. Indian law is different."
Śyāmasundara,"I think it's a world copyright, or else we could publish inJapanalso.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Śyāmasundara,"I think this is a world copyright, or else we would be able to publish inJapan, in...",Prabhupāda, SoJapanis out of world?
Śyāmasundara,It's out of U.S.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Śyāmasundara,It's out of the U.S.A.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara,Like India.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Śyāmasundara,I think their copyright...,Prabhupāda," No, no, no."
Śyāmasundara,...is binding around the world.,Prabhupāda," If they want to publish, let them publish."
Śyāmasundara,Yes.,Prabhupāda," That I offered them, that ""We are going to publish."" So there was no reply."
Śyāmasundara,Oh.,Prabhupāda, They did not comment and...
Śyāmasundara,You already offered.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Prabhupāda?,Prabhupāda, Hum?
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Should we go chant our rounds now?,Prabhupāda," Yes. [break] But one thing is that all right, he can go as my relative, because as visitor if he goes, then he cannot be admitted in school."
Guest,That's right.,Prabhupāda, But if he goes as my unmarried grandson...
Guest,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Then he can get. So that will be done. (Hindi) So your sons are very good sons. I have got all blessings for them. (Hindi)
Guest,"(Hindi) You have so many grandsons, but I am the one erratic son, bad son.",Prabhupāda, (laughs) What is that problem?
Guest,Material problems. (Hindi),Prabhupāda," (Hindi) I never told you that you give up your family life, but in family life you just chantHareKṛṣṇa. (Hindi conversation) There, there is a similar case in Lord Caitanya's time. The son became first a great devotee. So when the father came, thenCaitanyaMahāprabhu, (indistinct). Then father said, ""No. He is my father.'' (laughs) So (Hindi conversation) Political economics and..."
Guest,Indian literature.,Prabhupāda, Indian Literature. That's nice. So their work is proposed to...
Guest,"I think he should go there to study something, earn some money. That's all. (Hindi)",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,(Hindi conversation),Prabhupāda," Yasyātma-buddhiḥkuṇape tridhātukesva-dhīḥkalatrādiṣubhaumaijya-dhīḥ.Bhaumaijya-dhīḥ. These are nationality,yebhaumaijya-dhīḥ, the conception of worshiping the land,bhauma.Bhaumameans land,bhūmi.Ijya,ijyameans worshipable. So one who thinks thatbhauma,bhūmi, anything made ofbhūmi, earth, worshipable..."
Guest,"I don't call it worshipable, Prabhupāda, but I have, I have more (indistinct) with this name, because...",Prabhupāda," (Hindi) This is all illusion. Thisjananījanmabhūmi,huh?"
Devotee,I'm going forGurudasa.,Prabhupāda," Accha. Thisijya-dhīḥ, to worship the land of birth, butbhārata-bhūmihas special, it ispūjā..."
Guest,That is my contention.,Prabhupāda," Not, not as nationality."
Guest,Not as nationality. There are more...,Prabhupāda," But the land where LordKṛṣṇacame, LordRāmacame, LordCaitanyacame, that land is certainly worshipable. That is another thing. In that way..."
Guest,In that way I was saying that we talk more of spiritualism here. I don't know whether they talk it in other countries or not. But we do here more.,Prabhupāda," No, no. Other countries all they have got high respect for India as spiritual land. But we are killing, our present government and so-called leaders, killing that state. This is regrettable. They could hold thisBhārata-varṣato the topmost summit all over the India if after independence they would have organizedly preachedBhagavad-gītāand the Vedic culture. That is my mission. Now whatever you may think ofBhārata-varṣa, outside, India is known as a poor, poorest country, because our ministers go there to beg."
Guest (2),"Prabhupāda, you have said that, really, what I read this morning, that if (indistinct) comes, we have to fight. Did you say to the people...",Prabhupāda, Yes. They asked me; I said.
Guest (2),"That's what we want to hear now, you know.",Prabhupāda, So these messages are very nice?
Devotee (3),"What did you say to them, Śrīla Prabhupāda?",Prabhupāda, What was the language?
Guest (2),"When the war comes,Kṛṣṇaalso said, askedArjunato fight.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),"If it's a just war, you have to fight.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),"So that if it's a just war we are going to fight. And the war is coming, Prabhupāda.",Prabhupāda, So that's all right. Why should we be afraid of fighting?
Guest (2),We are not afraid!,Prabhupāda," We never... TheBhagavad-gītānever says that when enemy attacks, you become nonviolent. No, no. Never. Rather,Gandhisaid that ""Yes, I shall...'' Somebody askedGandhithat ""If in your presence your wife or your daughter is ravaged, what you will do?'' That question was there, actually. But he said that ""I say nonviolence upon..."""
Guest (2),"No, no, no. Another part. Then he said, ""I'll hit him back.'' On that condition. He said, ""If that comes all right, hit him back.""",Prabhupāda, He said that.
Guest (2),"He said, ""If aduṣṭadoes that to you, you hit her back.""",Prabhupāda," Yes. That is our policy. Ourātatāyinaḥ, theśastraātatāyinaḥ.Ātatāyinaḥmeans a person who usurps my property."
Guest (2),A tyrant.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest (2),"A tyrant,ātatāyinaḥ.",Prabhupāda," Aggressor, aggressor."
Guest (2),Aggressor.,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest (2),Ātatāyinaḥ.,Prabhupāda," Who sets fire in my home and who wants to kill me, they're calledātatāyinaḥ. So they should be immediately killed. There's no question of nonviolent. And if theVaiṣṇavais insulted, he should be killed immediately. That is also,CaitanyaMahāprabhuwho advised that we should be humbler than the grass, but practically whenNityānandaPrabhuwas insulted, He immediately wanted to killJagāiandMādhāi. So these messages..."
Guest,This has touched people.,Prabhupāda," Ha,ha."
Guest (2),This is what they're worried about. Did you know last time there were these signals practicing black-out and all that sort of thing? So now whole country is full of it.,Prabhupāda," Lord Rāmacandra's father, DaśarathaMaharaja, about him it is written,samūla varthamnavadhṛt ariṁśca(?). There are many qualifications. Out of that, one qualification wassamula avarthamnavadhṛt hariṁśca.(?)Enemy will come, then he will uproot the whole generation.Samula varthamnavadhṛt hariṁśca(?)."
Guest,"After the festival, Prabhupāda, are you going toVṛndāvana?",Prabhupāda," Yes, I am thinking of. I have not gone for many years."
Guest,Your room is very well kept there. I have been to that place myself.,Prabhupāda, Oh.
Guest,We have seen that your room is kept well.,Prabhupāda," Yes.Gurudasais keeping? So I can go and live in my room. The difficulty is that whenever I go, at least another half-a-dozen or dozen will go."
Devotee,The entourage.,Prabhupāda," (laughs) So what shall I do? Therefore, otherwise I likedRādhā-Dāmodaratemple, but..."
Guest,We can find a place for them.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,We can just go and arrange it if you allow us.,Prabhupāda, Ah.
Guest,We go while the festival is on. We can arrange for your place for you and for devotees...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Guest,...to stay. I can do that.,Prabhupāda, That's all right.
Guest,I'm going a couple of days earlier anyway.,Prabhupāda, All right. So (Hindi).
Guest,Rohita.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,Rohita.,Prabhupāda," Rohita, yes, I remember."
Guest,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, Rohita.Rohitawas the son of...
Guest,Hariścandra.,Prabhupāda," Hariścandra, yes. And daughters?"
Guest,"Daughters they will be bringing with them this evening also, the two daughters.",Prabhupāda, Oh. So how old they are?
Guest,One is about seventeen.,Prabhupāda, One I think ten years.
Guest,"Yesterday the two younger ones came. Of the two elder ones, we'll bring this evening. They are eighteen..., seventeen and eighteen.",Prabhupāda, So...
Guest,One is studying to be...,Prabhupāda, You are trying to find out some groom? Not yet.
Guest,Not yet. I have not done anything.,Prabhupāda, I think you can get them married if you find out good boy.
Guest,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, Working.
Guest,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, Good health and working. Never mind rich or poor.
Guest,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, You should see that he is good health and working. That's all. Not idle. So in your community I... (end)
Reporter,"It's very, I think, sir, that we must, as you say, live and have our being inKṛṣṇa...",Prabhupāda," Yes. It is already, but you have forgot."
Reporter,"It is unique. It is so unique. Of course, I mean to say...",Prabhupāda, Huh? Why it is not easy?
Reporter,"It is not easy to be able to live, everybody... You know what apāpīI am. I don't think theKṛṣṇaconsciousness is so easy...",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. Even if you arepāpī, if you see... Don't you see the sunlight?"
Reporter,It's very easy to see.,Prabhupāda, Suppose you arepāpī. Do you think that you don't see the sunlight?
Reporter,"Yes, we do.",Prabhupāda," So ifKṛṣṇasays, ""The sunlight is Myself,'' what is the difficulty, even if you arepāpī?If..., don't... If you say, ""I won't understand like that,'' that is another thing. But if the statement is clear, even if you arepāpī, what is the difficulty to understand? Simply if you say, ""I won't understand,'' like this, that is a different thing."
Reporter,"No, no, no. So how do you explain to a Muslim, he's...",Prabhupāda," No, no, no. You say one after another."
Reporter,"Yes, sir.",Prabhupāda, Don't make me distressed. So try to understand.
Reporter,Yes.,Prabhupāda," You have raised that ""I cannot understand.'' What is the difficulty to understand?"
Reporter,"I mean to be able to actually live it, day to day, like.",Prabhupāda," This is a question of... Even supposeKṛṣṇasays, ""This beautiful flower I am.'' So you are seeing this beautiful flower. So why do you not understand ifKṛṣṇasays like that? This isKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Kṛṣṇasays,bhūmir āpo 'nalovāyuḥkhaṁbuddhiḥmanaḥevacabhinnāmeprakṛtiḥaṣṭadhā:[Bg.7.4] ""These eight (indistinct), eight kinds of material elements, they are My energy.'' So you are sitting on the ground,bhūmiḥ, so if you understand that it is one of the energy ofKṛṣṇa.... Just like the electric fan is running on, everyone knows there is electric energy. Similarly, if you see the ground,bhūmiḥ, as expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy, what is the difficulty?Bhūmir āpo 'nalovayuḥ."
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,"It is very easy to... Sir, what is difficult to...",Prabhupāda, I do not know what is the difficulty. (Hindi)
Reporter,(Hindi) (laughter),Prabhupāda," It is very simple, you see. Actually one who does not understand what isKṛṣṇa, for the neophyte, the prescription is there, that ""You understandKṛṣṇalike this.'' Because you are dealing withbhūmiḥ, you are dealing with water, you are dealing"
Reporter,"Sir, nobody is denying. Only we are trying to comprehend, understand.",Prabhupāda," So there is no question of comprehension. When you see a snake, call it a snake. There is no question of comprehension. This is a fan, everyone knows. When I will say, ""This is a fan,'' everyone understands it. Law of identification.Kṛṣṇais identifying Himself, that ""This is my energy."""
Reporter,Let us understand you first of all.,Prabhupāda," I have no personal presentation. I am speaking only whatKṛṣṇa... Therefore we are presentingBhagavad-gītāAs It Is. Here is the book, you see. This book,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is, which we are presenting, and publisher is Macmillan Company, and every year they are printing at least fifty thousand copies. This is for our fifth edition. They are printing this book since 1968. '68, '69, '70, '71, that, I think, I know they have, they are fifth edition, and people are reading it,Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is. Our..., we don't change.Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am the Supreme,'' and we are sayingKṛṣṇais the same, Supreme. Even I do not understand what isKṛṣṇa, I am simply presenting what is written in theBhagavad-gītā.mattaḥparataraṁnānyat kiñcidastidhanañjaya:[Bg.7.7]""There is no superior element above Me.'' So we say, ""Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. There is no other Supreme.''Kṛṣṇasays,man-manābhavamad-bhaktomad-yājīmāṁnamaskuru[Bg.18.65]. We say that ""You follow, think ofKṛṣṇa, you become a devotee ofKṛṣṇa, you offer your respect toKṛṣṇa.'' So we are not (indistinct), because we are presentingKṛṣṇaas He is speaking in theBhagavad-gītā, that's all."
Reporter,How do you feel the modern world...,Prabhupāda, This is the feeling. You see the effect.
Reporter,What's your feeling?,Prabhupāda," My feeling, I am very satisfied thatKṛṣṇais accepted by presenting as He is. I must be very satisfied, because before me, who did not presentKṛṣṇaas He is, there was not a singleKṛṣṇaconscious person in the Western world. Now I have got thousands. So why I shall not feel satisfied? Those who misinterpretedBhagavad-gītā—""This is this, this is that, this is that''—they could not get even oneKṛṣṇaconscious person, and by presentingBhagavad-gītā, they are selling fifty thousand copies per month, and I am getting every year one thousand, two thousandKṛṣṇadevotees. So why it is not practical?"
Reporter,In India?,Prabhupāda, In India everyone isKṛṣṇaconscious. They are trying to forgetKṛṣṇaconsciousness.
Reporter,"Oh, we are. I see.",Prabhupāda, EveryoneKṛṣṇaconscious. Who does not knowKṛṣṇa?
Reporter,"That's right, sir, that is we are very poor specimens. I mean every...",Prabhupāda," No. By force you are trying to forgetKṛṣṇa, that's all."
Reporter,"Sir, I beg your pardon, sir. We are very poor specimens.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,"If, as you said, sir, we are all, everybody isKṛṣṇaconscious in India, still I can say we are to (indistinct) problems here. We are very poor specimens. I won't talk in all other...",Prabhupāda, But you do... Don't you... You have not heard Kṛṣṇa's name?
Reporter,We have heard...,Prabhupāda," No, no. You have not heard Kṛṣṇa's name? Then why you are notKṛṣṇaconscious?"
Reporter,We are conscious of the Kṛṣṇa's existence.,Prabhupāda," Outside..., out of India they ask us this question, that ""In India, how manyKṛṣṇaconscious?'' Every Indian isKṛṣṇaconscious. Every Indian isKṛṣṇaconscious. But he's trying to forget by artificial means."
Reporter,So you mean byKṛṣṇaconscious...,Prabhupāda," By nature every Indian born isKṛṣṇaconscious, but at the present moment they are trying to forget Him. That is the problem, going on."
Reporter,What part ofKṛṣṇa? Or just part of His life?,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa, there is no part.Kṛṣṇais absolute."
Reporter,"He doesn't have form. For me, and for my child, Kṛṣṇa's here child life is very better.",Prabhupāda," For child, and for me or for you, simply try to understand that there is a personKṛṣṇa. That's all."
Reporter,"So, sir, are we rightly understanding that by ""Kṛṣṇa'' you mean some eternal principle, not as...",Prabhupāda," Not principle. A person, like you, like me."
Reporter,A person?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just so you are talking with me, I am talking with you, you are person, I am person, similarlyKṛṣṇais a person."
Reporter,"Person in the ordinary sense of the word, or...?",Prabhupāda, No. He is Supreme Person.
Reporter,Supreme?,Prabhupāda," Yes. Just like we are sitting here in Delhi City. Now here is Lalaji. He is supreme personality, mayor. (laughter)"
Reporter,"So we, we can see and feel and touch Him and be something also like...",Prabhupāda," No. I am taking for example India, the president is the supreme personality. The president is the supreme personality. You have to admit it. You may accept him or not, but officially you have to admit. So in this whole creation, cosmic manifestation, there must be some Supreme Personality. That isKṛṣṇa. That is confirmed byKṛṣṇaand theBhagavad-gītā,mattaḥparataraṁnānyat kiñcid as tidhanañjaya:[Bg.7.7]""There is no superior personality than Me.'' And we accept it. There is ourKṛṣṇaconsciousness: ""Oh,Kṛṣṇais the Supreme Person.'' So our knowledge is very easy. We don't make any research. Here isKṛṣṇasays that He is the Supreme Personality—we accept it. That's all. It is very simple."
Reporter,"Can we see Him, just as we see Lalaji?",Prabhupāda, And why not? Why not?
Reporter,But with these eyes or the...,Prabhupāda," Yes, with these eyes. Simply you have to purify. Just like Lalaji, now he is known here. We can see. But he goes in the streets, nobody knows him. So you mis..., might have seen Lalaji; he cannot see. Is it not? Tell me this? One who does not know Lalaji, Lalaji on the street, then even Lalaji meets him he does not see him. Why?"
Reporter,"Question of eyes and knowing, sir.",Prabhupāda, Yes. Then he has to make prepare his eyes to see Lalaji.
Reporter,"So, sir, how do we prepare eyes to see?",Prabhupāda," That is, that is the question."
Reporter,"(indistinct) (laughter) He said it's easy. I said, well, I know what is...",Prabhupāda," No, no. It is easy. It is easy. Suppose I say, you say that ""I have never seen Lalaji,'' and if I say, ""Here is Lalaji. Why don't you see?'' and if he accepts, that is... That's all right. What is the difficulty? If you say, ""No, I cannot believe you. I don't think that he is Lalaji. Lalaji, why he is walking on the street? He must be in a big, nice car.'' But if you put all this argument, then it is very difficult for you. But if you believe me that ""Here is Lalaji,'' then the matter is very simple."
Reporter,The question is faith versus the...,Prabhupāda," It is not faith. It is notLala... When I speak ""Here is Lalaji,'' it is not faith. It is fact."
Reporter,I guess because you have...,Prabhupāda, But you don't believe me.
Reporter,"Because you have personally witnessed, you see, sir.",Prabhupāda, That's all. It is not faith.
Reporter,"Oh, yes, sir. You are (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," If you believe me, then it is all right. If you don't believe me, that is different."
Reporter,"Then, sir, if everybody (indistinct) and that comment, ""Believe me,'' that...",Prabhupāda," No. Why do I say...? You have to, you have to see whether, whether this person is worthy of believing. (laughter)"
Reporter,Whether theguruis right.,Prabhupāda," Yes. Thereforeguru,gurucannot be any ordinary man."
Reporter,That's right.,Prabhupāda," Thatgurucannot be. Thatguru'sdesignation is there in theVedas, thattasmādguruṁprapadyetajijñāsuḥśreyauttamam[SB 11.3.21]. Anyone who is inquisitive for understanding... Suppose if you are inquisitive to understand really what is Lalaji, then you must approach to a person who knows Lalaji. Then you will understand Lalaji. And if you approach somebody who does not know Lalaji, then he may give you misinformation. Soguruis that who knowsKṛṣṇa. Otherwise you will not be able to understand what isKṛṣṇa. ThatKṛṣṇaalso very easily you can find out. Take whatKṛṣṇasays.KṛṣṇateachesBhagavad-gītātoArjunadirectly. Now if you believeArjuna, then you understandKṛṣṇa.KṛṣṇataughtBhagavad-gītātoArjuna, and whyArjunawas taught, that is also said byKṛṣṇa, thatbhakto 'si priyo 'si:[Bg.4.3] ""Because you are My devotee.''Kṛṣṇadid not go to teachBhagavad-gītāto a Vedantist. He went to teach toArjuna. He was a family man, he was a soldier, but why he was selected? He,Kṛṣṇasaid,bhakto 'si. So if you approach aKṛṣṇabhaktalikeArjuna, then you will understandKṛṣṇa; otherwise you will not. They are understandingKṛṣṇathrough me, not before me. But if they or some of them, ""something,'' some of them ""something,'' they may be very big scholar, but they did not know what isKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,So first there should be direct...,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,...apprehension by...,Prabhupāda," Yes. One must bebrahma-niṣṭham,śrotriyaṁbrahma-niṣṭham.Tadvijñānārthaṁsagurumevaabhigacchet[MU1.2.12].Abhigacchetmeansmust. Youmustfind out aguruwho knowsKṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no possibility of knowingKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,"So, sir, for we poor mortals it is very difficult to immediately, you see, to...",Prabhupāda, It is not a subject matter to understand immediately.
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, It is not subject matter to understand immediately. It is a science.
Reporter,"Yes, a science.",Prabhupāda," It is a science,jñānasavijñāna. So you cannot understand a science in five minutes. That is not possible."
Reporter,Yes. So we were trying to understand... No. We have just come to understand you.,Prabhupāda, Yes. That was others you cannot understand. (laughter)
Reporter,(indistinct) He is trying to tell some kind of parochial (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," If you kindly accept what I say, then it is possible. If you are simply, what I say, if you have faith in me, and if what I say you believe, then you can understand. Other, it is not possible."
Reporter,"Can there be an existence without a faith, sir?",Prabhupāda," No. Faith is the beginning. But you have to... If you don't increase that faith scientifically, then that faith will not help you."
Reporter,"My (indistinct), sir, that without existence, without faith, there can not be (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," No, no. That I say: faith is the beginning. Faith is the beginning."
Reporter,"Because I take the word of my father, of my mother, that he is my father...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,...I cannot prove it. Nobody can prove it that he is my father.,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes. Therefore that is the beginning of knowledge. That is the beginning,adauśraddhā. That is stated in theśāstra:adauśraddhā, faith. Then if you have gotśraddhā, thenādauśraddhātataḥsādhu-saṅgaḥ[Cc.Madhya23.14-15]. Suppose if you are, if you are very much anxious, you have got faith to understandKṛṣṇa, then next step is to associate with persons who knowKṛṣṇa. Just like you are doing some business, so you have to enter into some association, businessmen, to understand the business from them. Similarly, if you have faith inKṛṣṇa, then you have to understand Him through the association of devotees.Ādauśraddhātataḥsādhu-saṅgau[Cc.Madhya23.14-15].Athabhajana-kriyā. Then as soon as you have... Just as these boys, they came to me. After association they wanted to be initiated: ""Swami, please initiate.'' That is calledbhajana-kriyā.Ādauśraddhātataḥsādhu-saṅgaḥathabhajanakriyā. And if you are performingbhajanakriyānicely, thenanartha-nivṛttiḥsyāt, then all misgivings will go away."
Reporter,Anarthavisya.,Prabhupāda," Anartha-nivṛttiḥsyāt. Then nobody will question. All questions will beanartha-nivṛttiḥ, all doubts gone. Thenniṣṭhā, firm faith. Then firm faith,niṣṭhā. Then taste. Whenever there isKṛṣṇatopics, immediately you go.Tatoniṣṭhā..."
Reporter,Taste?,Prabhupāda," Taste,ruciḥ."
Reporter,"Accha. Taste,ruciḥ.",Prabhupāda," Tatoniṣṭhātataḥruciḥathāsakti, then attachment."
Reporter,Tathā?,Prabhupāda, Āsakti.
Reporter,Āsakti.,Prabhupāda," Mayyāsakta-manāḥpārthayogaṁyuñjanmad-āśrayaḥ. That isKṛṣṇasays,mayiāsakta. We have to increase ourāsakta, attachment, forKṛṣṇaby this process.Tathāsaktitataḥbhāvaḥ. Then you will seeKṛṣṇaeverywhere. That iskṛṣṇaprema."
Reporter,That isbhāva. That is at last...,Prabhupāda," Yes, not last. Last but one. The last stage is you can not live withoutKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,"What do you call in Sanskrit, sir?",Prabhupāda," That is called, first of allbhāvaḥ, thenprema,prema,kṛṣṇaprema. That is our high perfection. Just likeCaitanyaMahāprabhuis speaking that ""I am seeing everything vacant withoutKṛṣṇa.''Śūnyāyitaṁjagatsarvaṁgovinda-viraheṇame. That is the last stage of perfection. You becomemadabout, afterKṛṣṇa. So that will take time. This is the process. But faith is the beginning. Yes. And that faith is also explained by the author ofCaitanya-caritāmṛta:śraddhā-śabdeviśvāsasudṛḍhaniścaya. Faith means such faith that firm faith,sudṛḍha,niścaya, certain.Kṛṣṇabhaktikailesarva-karmakṛtahaya. This is faith. ThereforeKṛṣṇasaid thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66]. So faith means to believe in the word ofKṛṣṇa, that ""Surrendering toKṛṣṇaI will get everything. Now, I am free. This is my perfection.'' That is called faith.Kṛṣṇasaid thatsarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇaṁvraja[Bg.18.66]. Now, if I say unto you that ""You give up everything, come with me,'' unless you have got firm faith, how can you do it? That is faith. That faith has to be increased, and then it will reach to the stage of love."
Reporter,"Sir, just now we are coming from the press conference of another saint,BalaYogesvara. He said, his slogan is, ""Give me love, I'll give you peace.""",Prabhupāda, What?
Reporter,"He wants immediate this thing. Yours, in your case,premacomes last. He says, ""Give me love, I give you peace.''Śānti-premagośāntilo. (sound of siren) (discussion on siren sound)",Prabhupāda, I think blackout is over. (more discussion on blackout)
Devotee; Reporter,"Shut the shutters on the doors and we'll go right (indistinct).; Sir, this is the real present ugly reality here. We are being threatened.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,"This siren is a, shall I say, a very ugly reality before us.",Prabhupāda," You are already in ugly reality always, twenty-four hours. (laughter) Suppose there is no blackout. Still, if you go in the street, is there guarantee that you will go home?"
Reporter,Yes.,Prabhupāda, Is that guarantee?
Reporter,"No, no.",Prabhupāda, Then you are always in ugly reality. Why do you say this blackout? This is one of the features of that ugly reality. That's all.
Reporter,"Yes. At the moment I see, but has it...",Prabhupāda," Huh? (laughs) You are all, you do not realize that, that you are twenty-four hours in ugly reality! [break] ...attended.Padaṁpadaṁyadvipadām[SB 10.14.58]. Every step danger. Why taking this?"
Reporter,"I know, sir, but this is collective, national danger here. Have you anything to offer to us as a, as a...",Prabhupāda, ThisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. Our only remedy is thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You take to this and you will be happy. That's all.
Reporter,"We'll..., yes, sir. I think somebody should go to (indistinct), to those who are threatening us. Some, I wish...",Prabhupāda, What benefit you will derive by going to (indistinct)?

Reporter,"No, sir. That I can see, but...",Prabhupāda," Then what is the use of going to (indistinct)? You will die today or tomorrow. That's all. If you want to save yourself, then go toKṛṣṇa. That is our proposal. (laughter) As soon as you go the (indistinct), he does not fight, do you mean to say you will live forever?"
Reporter,"No, no, sir. I've got...",Prabhupāda, Then what is the use of telling (indistinct)? TrustRādhā-Kṛṣṇaso that you may perpetually be saved. Why don't you take that?
Reporter,"I was only thinking in terms of collective security, not... I can see your point now.",Prabhupāda, You should know that you are always in danger.
Reporter,"Yes, sir. We agree.",Prabhupāda, Oh.
Reporter,The great Einstein said the same thing when he was actually... He said there was no question...,Prabhupāda, That is our position.
Reporter,I could many times fall from here...,Prabhupāda," AndKṛṣṇasays, ""I will save you.'' Therefore let us go toKṛṣṇa. Why (indistinct)?"
Reporter,"Changing, because he is disturbing, that's all.",Prabhupāda, Disturbing... Your mind is also disturbing always.
Reporter,"Yes, yes. You are...",Prabhupāda," That is always with you. Your body disease always with you. Are you not suffering from bodily pains—""Oh, I'll (indistinct)""? Why don't you go to (indistinct) to cure your (indistinct)? (laughter). So why you do? You are already in danger. If you... Why don't you realize that point?"
Reporter,That I... Yes.,Prabhupāda, Therefore...
Reporter,But we are talking of national problems.,Prabhupāda," These are symptoms. Just like one man is diseased and he is saying, ""Oh, (indistinct).'' Real thing is his disease. These are symptoms. So people are trying to cure patchwork. We are giving the supreme cure. That is the difference. No patchwork, no patchwork disease cure will help you. Complete cure."
Reporter,Māmeti.,Prabhupāda," That's it. That we want. No more repetition of birth and death.Māmeti. That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness, benefit ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness.Yadgatvānanivartantetaddhāmaparamaṁmama[Bg.15.6]. If you go toKṛṣṇa, then you don't come back again."
Reporter,"Sir, I..., mine was a very hypothetical question. Supposing hundred pure saintlyKṛṣṇaconscious people are meditating or discussing or just serving together, and there comes somebody, someduṣṭa(?)who drops a bomb, and at the end of all...",Prabhupāda," So those who areKṛṣṇaconscious, he has not afraid of bomb. They are not afraid of bomb."
Reporter,"How to (indistinct) such people? We are such, sir, we are...",Prabhupāda," Now they receive bomb, then it is Kṛṣṇa's desire that bomb has come."
Reporter,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, (Hindi) (laughter)
Reporter,(Hindi),Prabhupāda," AKṛṣṇaconscious person is never afraid of anything.Bhayaṁdvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād. One who has conception of anything other thanKṛṣṇa, he is afraid. One who knows everything isKṛṣṇa, why he should be afraid? If bomb is coming, he will see, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇais coming.'' Yes. That is the vision of the devotee. So he thinks, ""Oh,Kṛṣṇawants to kill me as bomb. Oh, that's all right. I will be killed.'' That isKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Reporter,We do not fight?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,We do not fight?,Prabhupāda," No, he will fight. He will fight. By the direction ofKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,By God inside?,Prabhupāda," Yes. He is not..., he is not afraid of fighting, but he will fight under direction ofKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,"On that, sir, he has put the real question which I was fumbling to ask. So...",Prabhupāda, No.Kṛṣṇafought.Kṛṣṇa...
Reporter,In theKṛṣṇaconscious scheme there is also active struggle and activity?,Prabhupāda," Oh, yes. Certainly.Niyataṁkurukarmatvaṁkarmajyāyo hyakarmaṇaḥ. Instead of sitting idle, if you act badly, that is good."
Reporter,"Ah. There you are, sir.",Prabhupāda," That is Kṛṣṇa's advice.Kṛṣṇadoes not say sit idly. NeitherArjunawas advised like that. Neither...Arjunawanted to be nonviolent, sit idly.Kṛṣṇanever did so.Kṛṣṇasaid, ""Oh, you fight. You arekṣatriya. It is your duty.'' And in order to raise him to that fighting position, this position, He taught himBhagavad-gītā. So don't think thatKṛṣṇabhaktasare idle, sitting only. No. That is mistaken idea.Kṛṣṇabhaktacan do anything under the direction ofKṛṣṇa."
Reporter,You are not escapists?,Prabhupāda, No.
Reporter,"Maharaja, please go on here helping us. You know, we are (indistinct). (laughter) (Hindi) [break]",Prabhupāda," ...me that ""Your Vaiṣṇavism has killed India.'' And why? ""No,Vaiṣṇavameans inactive. They say simply chantHareKṛṣṇaand do nothing.'' Then ""You have not seen aVaiṣṇava,'' I told him."
Reporter,Pardon?,Prabhupāda, I told him that he has not seen aVaiṣṇava.
Reporter,Vaiṣṇava.,Prabhupāda," In India there are two major war,Rāma-rājyayudhaandkurukṣetrayudha, and there the hero is aVaiṣṇava-ArjunaandHanumān."
Reporter,Hanumān?,Prabhupāda, Hanumānjī.Rāma-rājya.
Reporter,He was perfectVaiṣṇava.,Prabhupāda," Therefore I told him that ""You haven't..., you have, have not seen aVaiṣṇava."""
Reporter,"Your permission, may I ask one question? Do we offer any solution for socio-economic problems that you can...?",Prabhupāda," Yes. Provided you becomeKṛṣṇaconscious, everything will be solved."
Reporter,"Will it come by itself, or will it come through you?",Prabhupāda, Immediately. Immediately.
Reporter,"How, sir?",Prabhupāda, Huh? That you have to take it.
Reporter,The condition is to follow the...,Prabhupāda," Just likeKṛṣṇasays,cātur-varṇyaṁmayāsṛṣṭaṁguṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:[Bg.4.13]""These fourvarṇas—brāhmaṇa,kṣatriya,vaiśya,śūdra—it is created by Me.'' But you are trying to kill it. Why? If you try to kill Kṛṣṇa's program, then how you will be happy?"
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," Huh? There is no question of preference. Kṛṣṇa's creation, it is there. You are creating (indistinct)caste,jana-saṅgaścaste.Casteis already given, in a different name. How you can make casteless? That is not possible. The whole world—""I am American,'' ""I am Indian''—this iscaste, biggercaste.Yasyātma-buddhi-kuṇa. So long you will be under the concept of this body, there must becastedivision. So we have to come to theKṛṣṇaconsciousness, then there will be nocaste. Just like these boys, Americans, Europeans, Africans, Canadians, they have nocaste, they have no nationality. They are simply forKṛṣṇa. That is casteless."
Reporter,So are theybrāhmaṇas?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Yes.Kṛṣṇaconscious meansbrāhmaṇa.Brahmajānātītibrāhmaṇaḥ.
Reporter,Not by birth?,Prabhupāda," Not by birth. They arebrāhmaṇasby quality. They have got sacred thread. That is also there in theśāstra.Yasyahiyadlakṣaṇaṁsyat.Varṇahas been given.Varṇa.Varṇa, we want to compare symptoms. Thebrāhmaṇasare this:satya,samaḥ,damaḥ,titikṣa,ārjavam,jñānamvijñānamāstikyaṁbrahma-karmasvabhāva-jam[Bg.18.42]. This is the symptom ofbrāhmaṇa. That is stated in theBhagavad-gītā. If you find these symptoms anywhere, he is abrāhmaṇa."
Reporter,"Except those who believe inBhagavad-gītā, not (indistinct), sir. They don't believe in that. They believecasteby birth.",Prabhupāda, He does not know what isBhagavad-gītā.
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," I say he does not know what isBhagavad-gītā. If he believes in that way, that he does not know aboutGītā."
Reporter,He says he'sHindu.,Prabhupāda, Maybe your Hinduism. You lick up your Hinduism. But we are creating realbrāhmaṇaall over the world.
Reporter,"I can see. What LordKṛṣṇahas stated, sir, that ""I have created these four castes ofāśrama...""",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,"And I as myself, just, as not somebody told me, just my...",Prabhupāda, Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ[Bg.4.13]. Not by birth.Kṛṣṇanever says...
Reporter,(indistinct),Prabhupāda," No, no. These four castes... Notcaste. We saycaste, butvarṇāśramavarṇa.Varṇa. Anyway, it is division. That division,vibhāga, the exact word is ""division,'' not ""caste.'' How you can saycaste, it is not there, difference? Division, these four divisions are there. So these divisions are not made by birth. Just like if you are a lawyer. So in the society there are lawyers, engineers, medical men, they are divisions. But these lawyers, medical men or engineers, they are not born as engineer or as lawyer. That is mistake. Anyone who is qualified by the real knowledge, he is a lawyer. Not by birth. Suppose a lawyer's son, a big, big lawyer's son, does it mean that he's lawyer?"
Reporter,No. But this is what we have been (indistinct).,Prabhupāda, So you have been something mistake. That should not be accepted.
Reporter,"Well, sir, you should know the problem all that there is a...",Prabhupāda, What is that problem?
Reporter,"All the (indistinct),harijanaswill (indistinct) you.",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,"If you proclaim that this is the real Hinduism, the people are getting fed up with Hinduism.",Prabhupāda, No. NoHindu. Why you are bringing Hinduism?
Reporter,"Our, this system...",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,...is only byHindu...,Prabhupāda," No, no. Hinduism is a foreign word, given by the Muslim. We don't find any word ""Hindu'' in the Vedic literature. Why do you call Hinduism? We are not preaching Hinduism. We are preachingKṛṣṇaconsciousness."
Reporter,"By such a social system, social...",Prabhupāda," That is, that you satisfy (indistinct). But this is a broadKṛṣṇaconsciousness. This is broader than any system,Kṛṣṇaconsciousness. We are not preaching. We don't go to preach that ""Oh, we are preaching Hinduism.'' But because those who are accepting thisKṛṣṇaconsciousness, mostly they are Hindus, then you can call it like Hinduism. But this is not Hinduism."
Reporter,"Sir, we are in illusion.",Prabhupāda, Yes. It is an illusory...
Reporter,Not illusory. I don't know how far Lalaji will go with you.,Prabhupāda, Lalaji is already with me! (laughter)
Reporter,(laughter) (reporter makes jokes) (Hindi),Prabhupāda, Give themprasāda.
Reporter,"Sir, would you like to give any message to the Indian people?",Prabhupāda," Yes. You take... My message is you takeBhagavad-gītāas it is seriously, you will be happy."
Reporter,That's all? Take it as is?,Prabhupāda, Take it AS IT IS. Don't try to interpret foolishly. That is my message.
Reporter,"But, sir...",Prabhupāda," So long they are simply foolishly interpreting, therefore they did not get any benefit. But if you take AS IT IS you'll get the benefit."
Reporter,"But sir, what are we to do with the (indistinct)?",Prabhupāda, Therefore I say I don't (indistinct) name.
Reporter,Who will name it? Who will (indistinct)?,Prabhupāda," There is no question ofbhāṣya. I say take it AS IT IS.Kṛṣṇasays, ""I am the Supreme.''Gītāgave. Whybhāṣya?Whybhāṣya?They,Kṛṣṇa, in theBhagavad-gītāit is said,dharma-kṣetrekuru-kṣetre[Bg.1.1].Kurukṣetreis still there, you know. There is a station. Why do you interpret in different way?"
Reporter,"Sir, it is a joy to be with you.",Prabhupāda, What is the use of interpretingKurukṣetraas different? That is a simple waste of time.
Reporter,"Are you a skeptic, sir?",Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,Have you been to Russia (indistinct) and (indistinct)?,Prabhupāda," Yes, yes."
Reporter,They allowed you to preach?,Prabhupāda, So why not? We are not afraid of anybody.
Reporter,Because they have their own (indistinct).,Prabhupāda," They may have, but the public is not their own. Public is different."
Reporter,That's all right. But you've got to get avisa. How do you... How can you get?,Prabhupāda, Then one Russian professor invited me already.
Reporter,Ah. And to receivevisa. Did you give some...,Prabhupāda, Professor Kotovsky.
Reporter,Kotovsky?,Prabhupāda, Yes. You know his name?
Reporter,"Well, I have heard of him.",Prabhupāda," Yes. He, not invited me officially, but he, we had correspondence. He said, ""Swamiji, you come this side, I shall be very glad to meet you."""
Reporter,So you went there?,Prabhupāda," Therefore, therefore I got thevisa."
Reporter; Reporter,When was this?; Twentieth of June.,Prabhupāda, Twentieth.
Reporter; Reporter,Twentieth.; Only this year?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,How long were you there?,Prabhupāda, Only one week.

Reporter,Were you always in Moscow?,Prabhupāda," Moscow, mostly."
Reporter,"I see. You..., what did, do they allow some lectures or...",Prabhupāda, No. I had meeting with Professor Kotovsky. That's all.
Reporter,Only?,Prabhupāda, Yes.
Reporter,Kotovsky only. That's all. He couldn't bring some people? Just his...,Prabhupāda," Yes. He had his assistants, I had my assistants."
Reporter,"...and some other people who said ""All right, we'll hear, like to hear...""",Prabhupāda," Well, that professor wanted to hear, that's all right. So I... My conclusion was that ""Your communistic idea has not very much improved from our idea, because you cannot do without surrendering. OurKṛṣṇaphilosophy is to surrender toKṛṣṇa.Kṛṣṇasays,sarvadharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇam[Bg.18.66]. So your surrendering process is there. You have not improved. You say God consciousness orKṛṣṇaconsciousness is not good, but you have not improved, because instead ofKṛṣṇa, you have surrendered to Lenin. That's all. So you have to surrender in any circumstance. Either you become communist or this 'ist' or that 'ist,' you have to surrender."""
Reporter,That's it. And you will go to (indistinct)?,Prabhupāda," This is a fact. This is a fact. You have to surrender to your senses. That's all. And we are simply recommending surrendering toKṛṣṇa. That's all. By surrendering to senses you are not happy, but if you surrender toKṛṣṇayou will be happy. Your surrender is there always. You cannot say that ""I don't surrender to anybody.'' That is nonsense."
Reporter,There should be right surrender.,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Reporter,There should be...,Prabhupāda," Yes. Because you are (indistinct), it is better to surrender and be peaceful. [break] ...here, there, here, there, here.Kṛṣṇasays, ""No. That surrender will not help you. Just surrender to Me, you will be happy.'' So intelligent person will feel that ""If I have to surrender, why not toKṛṣṇa? Why surrender to some foolish man? Let me surrender toKṛṣṇa. If my business is to surrender, I cannot do without surrender.'' That is intelligence. ThatKṛṣṇasays,"
Reporter,Sir... [break],Prabhupāda," We have to surrender, that's a fact. But we refuse to surrender toKṛṣṇa. That is our disease. He is not free, just like in a state, just like inMahatmaGandhi's time, so many started civil disobedience, but the government brought them all into prison, and they obliged them to obey.

Guest (2),Kalpanā.,Prabhupāda," Yes,kalpanā.Māyāvādītheory isbrahmanirākāra, so... (Hindi) You can imagine that God is so insignificant that you can imagine His form. This dangerous theory is going on in India. God is so insignificant that you can imagine at your whims whatever you like. Ramakrishna Mission is also preaching this, and now this big, bigsannyāsī, they also preaching this. God is a subject matter for, of my imagination, He is so insignificant. You have seen the paper?"
Guest (1),No. I haven't read this particular statement.,Prabhupāda," Oh. Rayananda(?), can you get that paper,Hindustan?"
Guest,Quite surprising. He's quite a learned scholar.,Prabhupāda," The learned scholar, they have been described inBhagavad-gītā,māyayaapahṛta-jñānāasurī-bhāvamāśritāḥ. Because they have taken this view that God is impersonal, He has no form, this isāsurī. Thenmāyayaapahṛta-jñānā. Therefore, however learned they may be,māyātakes away their knowledge.Māyayaapahṛta-jñānāasurī-bhāvamāśr... That is described in theBhagavad-gītā. (Hindi) The Absolute Truth, that is subjected to be imagined by me. I am a tiny soul.

Guest,"He is not abhakta, he is a scholar.",Prabhupāda," What is the nonsense scholar (laughter) if he does not know the truth? (Hindi)Māyayaapahṛta-jñānā.

Guest,They are subordinate to Him.,Prabhupāda, Yes. Subordinate. Yes.
Guest,"Therefore to meditate onKṛṣṇa, the onlyHareKṛṣṇa.",Prabhupāda, Yes. To meditate uponKṛṣṇais the highest yogic principle.
Guest,So that's what I asked...,Prabhupāda," Generally yogis, they observeviṣṇu-tattva, generally."
Guest,For what...,Prabhupāda," But higher yogis,bhakta-yogīs, they see onlyKṛṣṇa."
Guest,Kṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,yogināmapisarveṣāṁmad-gatenāntarātmanā[Bg.6.47]."
Guest,What is fit for lay people? Which form should we meditate upon?,Prabhupāda," ForKali-yuga, this isKṛṣṇa.Kīrtanādevakṛṣṇasya[SB 12.3.51].Kali-yuga,kīrtanādevakṛṣṇasya."
Guest,"I asked which form, that is the form...",Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇaform.
Guest,Kṛṣṇaform holdingmuralī(?)in His hand?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Veṇu,muralīdhara."
Guest,"But when you chant ""Rāma,'' the other...",Prabhupāda, Yes.Rāmais another... There is no difference betweenRāmaandKṛṣṇa. If you like...
Guest,The form comes different in the...,Prabhupāda," Yes, but they are the same.Rāmādimūrti."
Guest,"For purpose of practice I am asking, when you chantRāma, should you have the form ofRāmabefore you?",Prabhupāda," That, that depends on your affection.Bhagavānhas got many forms. If you want, if you loveRāma, that's all right. If you loveKṛṣṇa, that is all right. If you loveNārāyaṇa, that is also all right. ButBhagavānmūrti,rāmādi-mūrtiṣu."
Guest,Along withRādhe? (Hindi) (laughter),Prabhupāda, That is incongruency.RāmawithSītā.
Guest,Along with...,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,Kṛṣṇaalong withRādhikā.,Prabhupāda," Kṛṣṇa,Kṛṣṇawith Rādhārāṇī."
Guest,Then what isRādhācategory?,Prabhupāda," The sameśakti.Cit-śakti.Bhagavānkepleasure potency.Śakti,śakti-tattva. SoŚaktimān.BhagavānisŚaktimān,and thatśaktiis Rādhārāṇī orSītāorLakṣmī.Durgāis alsośakti, another feature of Rādhārāṇī."
Guest,Śaktiin original isRādhā?,Prabhupāda," Yes.Parāsyaśaktih...,parāsyaśaktir vividhaivaśrūyate[Cc.Madhya13.65, purport]. (Hindi) Originallycit-śakti. Thatcit-śaktiis expanding. Just like we are...,rāmādimūrtiṣukalā-niyamenatiṣṭhan[Bs. 5.39].Kalāmeans part and parcel. So we are also part and parcel, but we are very small part and parcel. Butrāmādimūrti, they are bigger part and parcel. Just like if you throw one brick on the floor, so there will be so many small particles, big particles, this particle, that. They are all part and parcel of the brick, but one part very small atomic part, and one big part, this part, this part, then this part, then this part. So all,Kṛṣṇais the origin, and everyone is part and parcel. Some of them are bigger and some of them are smaller. SoViṣṇu-tattvais almost likeKṛṣṇa."
Guest,LikeKṛṣṇa.,Prabhupāda," Others, they are very small. So according to the size, or according to the power..."
Guest,Power.,Prabhupāda," ...the part and parcel exercises his position. Some of them areViṣṇu-tattva, some of them areJīva-tattva, some of them areŚakti-tattvaand some of thempara-tattva. Like that."
Guest,Para-tattva?,Prabhupāda, Para-tattva.
Guest,Means?,Prabhupāda," Para-tattvaisBhagavān.Para-tattvameansKṛṣṇa,Rāma,Nārāyaṇa,Viṣṇu. These arepara-tattva.Bhagavānavatāra,rāmā,nṛsiṁha,varāha,kūrma,vāmana,daśāvatāra, allavatāra. (Hindi) Orśakti-tattva, material energy,aparā-tattva, matter. Similarlycit-tattva, spiritual world. The living entities, although they are in the material world, they belong to the spiritual world. ThereforeKṛṣṇasays,apareyam. This material energy is inferior.Itasviddhimeprakṛtiṁparām. Beyond this there is another, superior energy,jīva-bhūta, that isjīva."
Devotee,(indistinct),Prabhupāda, Hm.
Devotee,Kṣīrodakaśāyī-Viṣṇu...,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Devotee,Kṣīrodakaśāyī-Viṣṇuis in which category?,Prabhupāda, He ispara-tattva.
Devotee,"And, uh...",Prabhupāda, Anyviṣṇu-tattvaispara-tattva.
Guest,What is definition of (indistinct)?,Prabhupāda, Huh?
Guest,"Some people say thatjīvais a, you see, surrounded by (indistinct).",Prabhupāda," (Hindi) False. False ego. He is misidentifying with this matter. He is not matter. So thisahaṅkāra, this identification, has to be purified by understanding himself that ""I ambrahman. I am not matter.'' That is purification. And as soon as he is purified,brahma-bhūta[SB4.30.20]. Nowjīva-bhūta, but when he becomesbrahma-bhūta, then he becomes jolly.Brahma-bhutaḥprasannātmā[Bg.18.54]. That is the symptom. Not that ""I am realizedBrahman.'' But the symptom will be there. If he says, ""I am very rich man,'' then I'll see what is the symptom, whether you have got a nice car, you have got many servants and ""Oh, yes, you are rich man.'' And if you are working on the street with a sweeper, how can I accept it?"
Guest,If I am that bad balances and (indistinct). (laughter),Prabhupāda, Subject to your symptom. (laughter) (Hindi)
Guest,(Hindi),Prabhupāda, (Hindi)
Guest,We're just asking questions and questions. (indistinct) Endeavor to understand it. (indistinct),Prabhupāda," Bhagavān'srāsa-līlais very confidential. It is not for ordinary man. (Hindi) So, step by step (Hindi).Rādhā-Kṛṣṇarāsa-līla,Kṛṣṇawith young girls dancing, embracing, kissing, just like ordinary novel andnātha. They like it. So these professionalBhāgavatareaders, they take advantage of the people's inferior quality, of their weakness, and make money. That's all."
Guest,That's why I wanted to know...,Prabhupāda, Yes. They make money.
Guest,"...the real significance, that spiritual...",Prabhupāda," The significance..., there is no significance. These professionalBhāgavatareaders, they make money from the public because public wants to hear all these things. Just like we read a novel-a woman is embracing a man, or kissing or having sex. They like it. Therefore they go theBhāgavataTenth Canto immediately. TheirBhāgavatareading is professional, not understanding ofKṛṣṇa. If you want to understandKṛṣṇa, then go step by step, one by one. First of all readBhagavad-gītā, try to understand, and you surrender toKṛṣṇaasKṛṣṇasays, then you enter. Just like after passing entrance examination you enter into the college. Similarly, when you are qualified in acceptingKṛṣṇaas all in all,sarva-dharmānparityajyamāmekaṁśaraṇam[Bg.18.66], then you enter intoBhāgavata.Bhāgavatais the graduate study, not ordinary study. But these professionals, they take advantage of the weakness of the people, and they make profession and earn some money. That's all. When we speak ofBhāgavatawe speak from First Canto, Second Canto, Third Canto..., the nine cantos to understandKṛṣṇa. Just like in First Canto the beginning,janmādyasyayataḥ[SB1.1.1],oṁnamobhagavatevāsudevāya,janmādyasyayataḥ. This isVedānta-sūtraverse.Paraṁsatyaṁdhīmahi. (Hindi)Kṛṣṇafor perfect knowledge, then you'll understand what iskṛṣṇa-līlā. (end)"
Devotee,Sleeping tablets.,Prabhupāda," Sleeping tablets. He cannot sleep. Similarly,Brahmānandawas telling about his father. So if you can earn money, you can make a good bank balance, that does not mean that you will get bodily comfort. That is not. That is already fixed up, according to yourkarma. So don't waste your time for improving bodily comforts. Simply try to improve how you'll become more and moreKṛṣṇaconscious, how you will serveKṛṣṇamore and more, very nicely. That should be all.Tasyaivahetoḥprayatetakovido[SB1.5.18]. For that purpose our life should be engaged, not for so-called bodily comfort. That is already fixed-up."
Devotee,"You said that if you have some material desire and you take toKṛṣṇaconsciousness, you get double benefit, that the material desire is fulfilled and also you getKṛṣṇaconsciousness.",Prabhupāda, Yes.
Devotee,"But if you have that material desire, does that slow up your advancement?",Prabhupāda," ByKṛṣṇaconsciousness it will vanish. ButKṛṣṇais so kind, because you desire, He'll give you. He'll give you.Kṛṣṇais so kind that ""Oh, you wanted this? All right, you take!'' That is the benefit ofKṛṣṇaconsciousness. You get both these things. You reject, ""No, I asked for...'' That is real pure devotion. ""For this paltry happiness I requestedKṛṣṇa. What a fool I was.'' ButKṛṣṇawill give you because you desire. ThereforeDhruvaMaharajaregretted that ""I was such a fool that I came to in the forestKṛṣṇafor asking my father's property. What a nonsense I was.'' ButKṛṣṇagave. Better than. He demanded that ""I shall have a property,'' because that was child. His stepmother insulted, so he was determined.NāradaMunihad requested him, ""My dear boy, you are child. Why you be afflicted to this insult? Go now to play.'' So he said, ""Your instruction is very nice, but I am so degraded, I cannot accept it as such. If you kindly give me some way that I can get,'' I mean, ""material opulence better than my grandfather and father. You just give me such a post.'' His father was Uttānapāda. Grandfather wasBrahma. So he wanted a post better thanBrahma. So he was given: ""Oh, yes, you'll get.'' But when he was offered a better position thanBrahma, he regretted that ""What I..., what a fool I was.'' He requested, ""Sir, I am very much satisfied simply by Your...'' ""Never mind. You enjoy, then you come back.''Kṛṣṇais so kind."
Devotee (2),...can you explain aboutvaibhavaandprabhāva?,Prabhupāda, What is that?
Devotee (2),Vaibhavaandprabhāva.,Prabhupāda, They're nonsense. Why do you ask all these questions?
Devotee (2),It is in theCaitanya...,Prabhupāda, Meher Baba?
Devotee (2); TamālaKṛṣṇa,"Teaching of LordCaitanya.; He's not saying ""Baba.'' Something I can't understand.",Prabhupāda," Meher Baba, he's a..."
TamālaKṛṣṇa,Vaibhava.,Prabhupāda," Oh, Meher..., andVaibhava. I thought that Meher Baba. (laughter) [break] There was aHariBaba, there was a Meher Baba. Meher Baba is famous in your country. Is it not?"
Devotees,Yes.,Prabhupāda," He's a nonsense.Vaibhava,prabhāvā, expansion ofKṛṣṇa. When the body is similar, but the color of the body different, that is calledvaibhava. Just likeBalarāma.Balarāma. Kṛṣṇa's body andBalarāma, there is no bodily difference, butKṛṣṇais blackish,Balarāmais whitish. These things are described in theTeachings of LordCaitanya. You don't read it?Huh?"
Devotee (2),"Yes, it's from theTeachings of LordCaitanya. I wanted some explanation about all this...",Prabhupāda," That explanation is there. Why you are asking me? That is... I do not remember exactly what is the features ofVaibhava. That is there. But thevaibhava,prabhāvā,vaibhava,vilāsa, there are detailed description of Kṛṣṇa's expansions. They are described there. You can refer to.Prabhāvā,vaibhava,vilāsa, they are expansions of Kṛṣṇa's differentavatāra, incarnation, and part, part of incarnation. So it is a huge list, and it's not always possible to remember them in detail. Better refer to the book. Is that all right?"
Devotee (2),Yes.,Prabhupāda, The teacher will remember all the work of the dictionary. (laughs) You can refer to the dictionary. (laughter) (end)
