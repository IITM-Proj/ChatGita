            "Yoga As Action",
            "In the sixth and eighth chapters of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, explains that the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and senses. This method, however, is very difficult for people to perform, especially in this age of Kali, an age characterized by ignorance and chaos.",
            "Although this eightfold yoga system is particularly recommended in the sixth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the Lord emphasizes that the process ofkarma-yoga,action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is superior. In this world, everyone acts to maintain his family, and everyone is working with a view to some self-interest, or personal sense gratification, be it concentrated or extended. But to act perfectly is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and this means acting detached from the fruits of labor.",
            "It is our duty to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because we are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the entire body, not for the individual parts. The goal is the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity should act for the satisfaction of the supreme whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and not for his own personal satisfaction. One who can do this is the perfectsanny\u0101s\u012band the perfect yogi. In the first verse of the sixth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the chapter dealing withs\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga,Bhagav\u0101n \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states,",
            "an\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phala\u1e41k\u0101rya\u1e41 karma karoti ya\u1e25sa sanny\u0101s\u012b ca yog\u012b cana niragnir na c\u0101kriya\u1e25",
            "\u201cOne who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.\u201d",
            "Sometimessanny\u0101s\u012bs(renunciants) incorrectly think that they have become liberated from all material engagements and therefore no longer have to performagni-hotra yaj\u00f1as,or fire sacrifices. This is a mistake. Certainyaj\u00f1as(sacrifices) have to be performed by everyone for purification. Sincesanny\u0101s\u012bsare not traditionally required to performyaj\u00f1as,they sometimes think that they can attain liberation by ceasing to perform the ritualisticyaj\u00f1as,but actually, unless one comes to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no question of liberation. Thosesanny\u0101s\u012bswho cease to performyaj\u00f1asare in fact acting out of self-interest, because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. That is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists (M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs), who have one major goal or demand: to become one with the supreme impersonal Being. The devotees have no such demands. They are simply satisfied in serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They do not want anything in return. That is the characteristic of pure devotion.",
            "It was Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu who expressed this devotional attitude so succinctly:",
            "na dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012b\u1e41kavit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 jagad-\u012b\u015ba k\u0101mayemama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvarebhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi",
            "\u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want is only the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka4) In essence, this is thebhakti-yogasystem. There are many examples of the pure devotional attitude. Once Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva told Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cMy dear boy, you have suffered so much for Me. Whatever you want, ask for it.\u201d Being a pure devotee, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja refused to ask for anything. He said, \u201cMy dear Master, I am not carrying out mercantile business with You. I will not accept any remuneration for my service.\u201d This is the pure devotional attitude.",
            "Yogis andj\u00f1\u0101n\u012bsare demanding to become one with the Supreme because they have such bitter experience suffering the material pangs. They want to become one with the Lord because they are suffering in separation. A pure devotee, however, does not experience this. Although separate from the Lord, he fully enjoys the service of the Lord in separation. The desire to become one with the impersonal Brahman, or to merge with God, is certainly greater than any material desire, but this is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogi who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. Such yogis are desirous of material power, and that is their conception of the perfection of yoga. Actually, this is not the perfection of yoga, but a materialistic process.",
            "If one practices the regulative principles of yoga, he can attain eight kinds of perfection. He can become lighter than a cotton swab. He can become heavier than a great stone. He can immediately get whatever he likes. Sometimes he can even create a planet. Although rare, such powerful yogis actually exist. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Yogi wanted to beget a man from a palm tree. He was thinking, \u201cWhy should a man have to live so many months within the womb of his mother? Why can\u2019t he be produced just like a fruit?\u201d Thinking like this, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Yogi produced men like coconuts. Sometimes yogis are so powerful, they can perform such acts, but these are all material powers. Ultimately such yogis are vanquished, because they cannot retain these material powers indefinitely.Bhakti-yog\u012bsare not interested in such powers.",
            "Thebhakti-yog\u012b,acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, works for the satisfaction of the whole without self-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not desire self-satisfaction. Rather, his criterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he is considered the perfectsanny\u0101s\u012band the perfect yogi.",
            "A pure devotee does not even want salvation. The salvationists want to be saved from rebirth, and the voidists also want to put an end to all material life. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, however, requested only devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, birth after birth; in other words, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was prepared to endure material miseries in one body after another. What, then, was Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s desire? He wanted to engage in God\u2019s service, and nothing more, for that is the real perfection of yoga.",
            "Whether in the spiritual sky or the material sky, the individual spirit soul is constitutionally the same. It is said that he is one ten-thousandth the part of the tip of a hair. This means that our position is that of a small particle. But spirit can expand. Just as we develop a material body in the material world, we develop a spiritual body in the spiritual world. In the material world, expansion takes place in contact with matter. In the spiritual world, this expansion is spiritual.",
            "Actually, the first lesson of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is, \u201cI am spirit soul. I am different from this body.\u201d I am a living force, but this material body is not a living force. It is dull matter, and it is activated only because spiritual force is present. In the spiritual world, everything is living force; there is no dead matter. There, the body is totally spiritual. One may compare the spirit soul with oil and the body with water. When oil is in water, there is a distinction, and that distinction always remains. In the spiritual sky, there is no question of oil being placed in water. There, everything is spirit.",
            "The impersonalists do not want to develop a body. They simply want to remain spiritual particles, and that is their idea of happiness. But webhakti-yog\u012bs(Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas) want to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore we require hands, legs, and all the other bodily parts. Indeed, we are given these bodies in order to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as we develop a material body in our mother\u2019s womb, we can similarly develop a spiritual body in the spiritual world.",
            "The spiritual body is developed through the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This material body is spiritualized by thisbhakti-yogaprocess. If you place an iron within fire, the iron becomes so hot that it also becomes fiery. When the iron is red hot, it acquires all the qualities of fire. If you touch something with that iron, that iron will act as fire. Similarly, although this body is material, it can become spiritualized through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and act as spirit. Although copper is just a metal, as soon as it comes in contact with electricity, it becomes electrified, and if you touch it, you will receive an electric shock.",
            "As soon as your body is spiritualized, material activity ceases. Material activity means acting for sense gratification. As you become spiritualized, material demands dwindle until they become nil. How is this possible? In order for an iron to act as fire, it must remain constantly in contact with fire. In order for the material body to become spiritualized, one must remain constantly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When this material body is fully engaged in spiritual activities, it becomes spiritual.",
            "According to the Vedic system, the body of a high personality, asanny\u0101s\u012b,is not burned but buried, because asanny\u0101s\u012b\u2019sbody is considered spiritual, having ceased to engage in material activities. If everyone in this world engages fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and ceases to work for sense gratification, this entire world will immediately become spiritual. Therefore it is necessary to learn how to work for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This requires a little time to understand. If something is used for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction, it is spiritual. Since we are using microphones, typewriters, etc., in order to talk and write about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they become spiritualized. What is the difference betweenpras\u0101daand ordinary food? Some people may say, \u201cWhat is thispras\u0101da? We are eating the same food. Why do you call itpras\u0101da?\u201d It ispras\u0101dabecause it has been offered for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction and has thus become spiritualized.",
            "In a higher sense, there is no matter at all. Everything is spiritual. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual and matter is one of the energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, matter is also spiritual. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is totally spiritual, and spirit comes from spirit. However, because the living entities are misusing this energy \u2013 that is, using it for something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s purposes \u2013 it becomes materialized, and so we call it matter. The purpose of this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is torespiritualizethis energy. It is our purpose to respiritualize the whole world, socially and politically. Of course, this may not be possible, but it is our ideal. At least if we individually take up this respiritualization process, our lives become perfect.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.22)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says He provides for His devotees by giving them what they lack and preserving what they have. People are very fond of saying that God helps those who help themselves, but they do not understand that helping yourself means putting yourself under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s protection. If one thinks, \u201cOh, I can help myself. I can protect myself,\u201d one is thinking foolishly. As long as my finger is attached to my body, it is useful, and I may spend thousands of dollars to preserve it. But if this finger is cut off, it is useless and is thrown away. Similarly, we are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and helping ourselves means putting ourselves in our proper position as His parts and parcels. Otherwise we are only fit to be cast away. The finger can help itself only when situated properly on the hand and working on behalf of the entire body. If the finger thinks, \u201cI will separate myself from this body and simply help myself,\u201d that finger will be cast away and will die. As soon as we think, \u201cI shall live independently of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d that is our spiritual death, and as soon as we engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, as His part and parcel, that is our spiritual life. Therefore, helping oneself means knowing one\u2019s actual position and working accordingly. It is not possible to help oneself without knowing one\u2019s position.",
            "Service means activity, for when we serve someone, we are acting. When we serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or cooking, or cleansing the temple, or distributing books about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or writing about Him, or shopping for foodstuff to offer Him. There are so many ways to serve. Helping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means acting for Him, not sitting down in one place and artificially meditating. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means activity. Whatever assets we have should be utilized for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the process ofbhakti-yoga.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given us a mind, and we must utilize this mind to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We have been given these hands, and we must use them to wash the temple or cook for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We have been given these legs, and we should use them to go to the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We have been given a nose, and we should use it to smell the flowers that have been offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Through the process ofbhakti-yoga,we engage all these senses in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in this way the senses are spiritualized.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,Arjuna was refusing to act, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was inspiring him to engage in activity. The entireBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is an inspiration to work, to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to act on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s behalf. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never tells Arjuna, \u201cMy dear friend Arjuna, don\u2019t concern yourself with this war. Just sit down and meditate upon Me.\u201d This is not the message of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.We are not to refrain from all activity, but only from those activities that impede our consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Meditation means stopping allnonsensicalactivity. Those who are advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are constantly working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "A mother tells only her bad child to sit down and do nothing. If a child can do nothing but disturb his mother, the mother says, \u201cMy dear child, just sit down here and keep quiet.\u201d But if the child can work nicely, the mother says, \u201cMy dear child, will you please help me do this? Will you go over there and do that?\u201d Sitting still in one place is just for those who do not know how to work sensibly. As long as the child sits in one place, he does not raise havoc. Sitting still means negating nonsense; it is not positive activity. In negation, there is no life. Positive activities constitute life, and positive activity is the message of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Spiritual life is not \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Spiritual life is\u201cDo this!\u201dIn order to act properly, there are certain things one must know not to do; therefore certain activities are forbidden. The wholeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,however, is\u201cdo.\u201dK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cFight for Me.\u201d At the beginning of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(2.2), when Arjuna told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cI will not fight,\u201d \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said,",

            "\u201cMy dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They lead not to higher planets, but to infamy.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly tells Arjuna that he is speaking like a non-\u0100ryan \u2013 that is, like one who does not know the spiritual values of life. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not mean sitting down idly.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself does not sit down idly. All His pastimes are filled with activity. When we go to the spiritual world, we will see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always engaged in dancing, eating, and enjoying. He does not sit down to meditate. Is there any account of thegop\u012bsmeditating? Did Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu sit down to meditate? No, He was always dancing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The spirit soul is naturally active. How can we sit down silently and do nothing? It is not possible. Therefore, after \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a outlined thes\u0101\u1e45khya-yogasystem in the sixth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,Arjuna frankly said,",
            "yo \u2019ya\u1e41 yogas tvay\u0101 prokta\u1e25s\u0101myena madhus\u016bdanaetasy\u0101ha\u1e41 na pa\u015by\u0101mica\u00f1calatv\u0101t sthiti\u1e41 sthir\u0101m",
            "\u201cO Madhus\u016bdana [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], the system of yoga You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.33)Although Arjuna was highly elevated and was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s intimate friend, he immediately refused to take up thiss\u0101\u1e45khya-yogasystem. In essence, he said, \u201cIt is not possible for me.\u201d How could it have been possible? Arjuna was a warrior, a householder, and he wanted a kingdom. What time did he have for meditation? He flatly refused to practice this type of meditational yoga, saying that the mind is as difficult to control as the wind(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.34). That is a fact. It is not possible to control the mind artificially; therefore we must engage the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Then it is controlled. If Arjuna found this process more difficult than controlling the wind, then what of us? After all, Arjuna was not an ordinary man. He was personally talking with the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he proclaimed the mind to be like a great wind. How can we control the wind? We can control the mind only by fixing it on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet. That is the perfection of meditation.",
            "No one really wants to sit down and meditate. Why should we? We\u2019re meant for positive activity, for recreation, for pleasure. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our recreation is dancing and chanting, and when we get tired, we takepras\u0101da.Is dancing difficult? Is chanting difficult? We don\u2019t charge anything to dance in the temple. If you go to a ballroom, you have to pay to enter, but we do not charge. It is natural to enjoy music and dancing and palatable foods. These are our recreations, and this is our method of meditation. So this yoga system is not at all laborious. It is simply recreation,susukham.It is stated in the ninth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.2)that this yoga issusukham \u2013very happy. \u201cIt is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.\u201d It is natural, automatic, and spontaneous. It is our real life in the spiritual world.",
            "In Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the spiritual world, there is no anxiety.Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhameans \u201cfreedom from anxiety,\u201d and in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha the liberated souls are always dancing, chanting, and takingpras\u0101da.There are no factories, hard work, or technical institutions. There is no need for these artificial things. In theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrait is stated,\u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t:God is\u0101nandamaya,full of bliss and pleasure. Since we are part and parcel of God, we also possess these same qualities. So the goal of our yoga process is to join with the supreme\u0101nandamaya,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to join His dance party. Then we will actually be happy.",
            "On this earth we are trying to be happy artificially and are therefore frustrated. Once we are situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we will revive our original position and become simply joyful. Since our actual nature is\u0101nandamaya,blissful, we are always searching for happiness. In the cities we are inundated with advertisements. Restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and dance halls are always announcing, \u201cCome on, here is\u0101nanda.Here is pleasure.\u201d That is because everyone is searching for\u0101nanda,pleasure. Our society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also announcing, \u201cHere is\u0101nanda,\u201d but our standard of pleasure is very different. In any case, the goal \u2013 pleasure \u2013 is the same.",
            "Most people are hunting for pleasure on the gross material platform. The more advanced search for pleasure in speculation, philosophy, poetry, or art. Thebhakti-yog\u012b,however, searches for pleasure on the transcendental platform, and that is his only business. Why are people working so hard all day? They are thinking, \u201cTonight I shall enjoy. Tonight I will associate with this girl or with my wife.\u201d Thus people are going to so much trouble to acquire a little pleasure. Pleasure is the ultimate goal, but unfortunately, under illusion, people do not know where real pleasure is to be found. Real pleasure exists eternally in the transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Perhaps you have seen pictures of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if so, you have noticed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always jolly. If you join His society, you will also become jolly. Have you ever seen pictures of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a working with a machine? Have you ever seen pictures of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a smoking? No, He isby naturefull of pleasure, and if you unfold yourself in that way, if you wholeheartedly take up the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, you will also find pleasure.

            "This is the real purpose of the practice of yoga. The word yoga means \u201cto join.\u201d Although we are naturally part and parcel of the Supreme, in our conditioned state we are now separated. Because of our separation, we are reluctant to understand God and to speak of our relationship with Him and are even inclined to think of such discussion as a waste of time. In a church or in a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness temple, we speak of God, but people in general are not very interested. They think it is a waste of time, a kind of recreation in the name of spiritual advancement, and they believe that this time could be better used to earn money or enjoy themselves in a nightclub or restaurant.",
            "Therefore, it is due to sense enjoyment that we are not attracted to God, and therefore it is said that those who are addicted to sense enjoyment cannot become yogis \u2013 that is, they are not eligible to participate in the yoga system. One cannot advance in any yoga system if he partakes in sense gratification and then sits down to try to meditate. This is just a colossal hoax. Such contradictory activity has no meaning. First of all, yoga means controlling the senses \u2013yama-niyama.There are eight stages of yoga \u2013yama, niyama, \u0101sana, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra,andsam\u0101dhi.",

Therefore, if one indulges his senses, he cannot be accepted as a yogi. Yoga demands strict celibacy. In the yoga system, there is no sex life. If one indulges in sex, he cannot be a yogi. Many so-called yogis come from India to America and say, \u201cYes, you can do whatever you like. You can have as much sex as you like. Just meditate. I will give you some mantra, and you will give me some money.\u201d This is all nonsense. According to the authoritative statements of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification. This is explicitly stated as the first condition for yoga practice.",

As long as one is not situated on the perfectional platform, he must engage in so many works. In the West, there are many yoga societies attempting to practice the asana system, and therefore they practice sitting in different postures. That may help, but it is only a preliminary process on the path to attaining the real yoga platform. The real yoga system, in its perfectional stage, is far different from these bodily gymnastics.",
            "It is important to understand, however, that from the beginning, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is situated on the platform of meditation because he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being constantly engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is considered to have ceased all material activities.",

            "This is actually the perfectional stage of yoga, and one who has attained this stage is said to have attained to yoga. This is to say that he has connected, joined, or linked himself with the supreme whole. If a part is disconnected from a machine, it serves no function, but as soon as it is properly attached to the machine, it works properly and carries out its different functions. That is the meaning of yoga \u2013 joining with the supreme whole, serving in conjunction with the total machine. Presently we are disconnected, and our material fruitive activities are simply a waste of time. One who engages in such activity is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as am\u016b\u1e0dha \u2013that is, a rascal. Although one may earn thousands of dollars daily and be an important businessman, he is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as am\u016b\u1e0dha,rascal, because he is just wasting his time in eating, sleeping, defending, and mating.",
            "People do not stop to consider that they are actually working very hard for nothing. One who earns millions of dollars cannot really eat much more than a man who makes ten dollars. A man who earns millions of dollars cannot mate with millions of women. That is not within his power. His mating power is the same as one who earns ten dollars, just as his power of eating is the same. This is to say that our power of enjoyment is limited. One should therefore think, \u201cMy enjoyment is the same as that of the man who is earning ten dollars daily. So why am I working so hard to earn millions of dollars? Why am I wasting my energy? I should engage my time and energy in understanding God. That is the purpose of life.\u201d If one has no economic problems, he has sufficient time to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If he wastes this precious time, he is called am\u016b\u1e0dha,a rascal or an ass.",
            "According to the preceding verse, a person is said to have attained yoga when he has renounced all material desires. Once we are situated perfectly in yoga, we are satisfied. We no longer experience material desires. We no longer act for sense gratification or engage in fruitive activity. When we speak of \u201cfruitive activity,\u201d we refer to activities carried out for the purpose of sense gratification. That is, we are earning money in order to gratify our senses. If one is virtuous, he engages in pious activities \u2013 he donates money to charities, opens hospitals, schools, etc. Although these are certainly virtuous activities, they are ultimately meant for sense gratification. How is this? If I donate to an educational institution, for instance, I will receive good educational facilities and will become highly educated in my next life. Being thus educated, I will attain a good position and will acquire a good amount of money. Then how will I utilize this money? For sense gratification. Thus these virtuous and fruitive activities form a kind of cycle.",
            "We often hear the expression \u201ca better standard of life,\u201d but what does this mean? It is said that the standard of life in America is superior to that in India, but in both countries there is eating, sleeping, defending, and mating. Of course, in America the quality of food may be better, but the eating process is there. A superior standard of life does not mean superior spiritual realization. It just means better eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. This is called fruitive activity, and it is based on sense gratification.",
            "Yoga has nothing to do with sense gratification or fruitive activity. Yoga means connecting with the Supreme. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja underwent severe austerities in order to see God, and when he finally saw God, he said,sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho \u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce:\u201cMy dear Lord, I am now fully satisfied.

Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s mother was rejected by his father, and his stepmother resented his sitting on his father\u2019s lap. Indeed, she forbade him to sit on his father\u2019s lap because Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was not born from her womb. Although only five years old, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was ak\u1e63atriya,and he took this as a great insult. Going to his own mother, he said, \u201cMother, my stepmother has insulted me by forbidding me to sit on my father\u2019s lap.\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja then started to cry, and his mother said, \u201cMy dear boy, what can I do? Your father loves your stepmother more than he loves me. I can do nothing.\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja then said, \u201cBut I want my father\u2019s kingdom. Tell me how I can get it.\u201d \u201cMy dear boy,\u201d his mother said, \u201cif K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, God, blesses you, you can get it.\u201d \u201cWhere is God?\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja asked. \u201cOh, it is said that God is in the forest,\u201d his mother said. \u201cGreat sages go to the forest to search for God.\u201d",
            "Hearing this, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went directly to the forest and began to perform severe penances. Finally he saw God, and when he saw Him, he no longer desired his father\u2019s kingdom. Instead, he said, \u201cMy dear Lord, I was searching for some pebbles, but instead I have found valuable jewels. I no longer care for my father\u2019s kingdom. Now I am fully satisfied.\u201d When one is actually connected with God, he is totally satisfied. His satisfaction is infinitely greater than so-called enjoyment in this material world. That is the satisfaction resulting from God realization, and that is the perfection of yoga.",
            "When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. It is impossible to cease all activity. As stated before, it is our nature as living entities to act. It is said, \u201cAn idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop.\u201d If we have no K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious engagement, we will engage in sense gratification or fruitive activity. If a child is not trained or educated, he becomes spoiled. If one does not practice the yoga system, if he does not attempt to control his senses by the yoga process, he will engage his senses in their own gratification. When one is gratifying his senses, there is no question of practicing yoga.",
            "Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has not realized K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.",
            "One may compare the yoga system to a stepladder. One yogi may be situated on the fifth step, another yogi may be on the fiftieth step and yet another on the five-hundredth step. The purpose, of course, is to reach the top. Although the entire ladder may be called the yoga system, one who is on the fifth step is not equal to one who is higher up. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a delineates a number of yoga systems \u2013karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga,andbhakti-yoga.All of these systems are connected with God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the entire ladder is connected to the topmost floor. This is not to say that everyone practicing the yoga system is situated on the topmost floor; only he who is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so situated. Others are situated on different steps of the yogic ladder.",

In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice,\u0101tm\u0101refers here to the mind.

Unless one can control the mind, there is no question of elevation. The body is like a chariot, and the mind is the driver. If you tell your driver, \u201cPlease take me to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a temple,\u201d the driver will take you there, but if you tell him, \u201cPlease take me to that liquor house,\u201d you will go there.

If you have no control over your driver, your driver is your enemy, but if he acts according to your orders, he is your friend.",
            "The yoga system is meant to control the mind in such a way that the mind will act as your friend. Sometimes the mind acts as a friend and sometimes as an enemy. Because we are part and parcel of the Supreme, who has infinite independence, we have minute, or finite, independence. It is the mind that is controlling that independence, and therefore he may either take us to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a temple or to some nightclub.",

He has no scope to act any other way. As soon as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is seated in the mind, there is light, just as when the sun is in the sky, darkness is vanquished. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like the sun, and when He is present, there is no scope for darkness.

If the mind is strongly fixed on the Supreme, it will not allow any nonsense to enter, and there will be no falldown. If the mind is strong, the driver is strong, and we may go wherever we may desire. The entire yoga system is meant to make the mind strong, to make it incapable of deviating from the Supreme.",

Since Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a householder, he was a pounds-shillings man. This means that he had to take into account pounds, shillings, and sixpence, or dollars and cents. Apart from being a householder, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was also a great king and devotee. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was a great yogi who happened to be very envious of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was thinking, \u201cI am a great yogi, and I can travel in space. This man is an ordinary king, and he does not possess such yogic powers. Still, people pay him more honor. Why is this? I will teach him a good lesson.\u201d Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni then proceeded to pick a quarrel with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, but because the king was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he managed to defeat this great yogi. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was consequently directed by N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to take shelter at the feet of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was such a perfect yogi that within a year he could travel throughout the material universe and also penetrate the spiritual universe. Indeed, he went directly to the abode of God, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and saw the Personality of Godhead Himself. Yet Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was so weak that he had to return to earth and fall at the feet of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was an ordinary king, but his one great qualification was that he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus his mind was always controlled, and he was situated at the highest perfectional level of yoga. We also can very easily control the mind by keeping it fixed on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within. Simply by thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we become victorious conquerors, topmost yogis.",

The cessation of nonsensical action is not in itself perfection. We mustactperfectly. Unless we train our senses to act in accordance with H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses, our senses will again engage in undesirable activities, and we will fall down.

In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind\u2019s ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

Therefore, in thePur\u0101\u1e47aswe find certain instructions that say in essence, \u201cAll right, if you want to eat meat, just worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b and sacrifice a goat for her. Only then can you eat meat. You cannot eat meat just by purchasing it from the butcher shop.

That type ofp\u016bj\u0101,or worship, is allowed on the night of the dark moon, which means once a month. There are also certain mantras to be chanted when the goat is sacrificed. The goat is told, \u201cYour life is being sacrificed before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b; you will therefore be immediately promoted to the human form.\u201d Generally, in order to attain the human form, a living entity has to pass through many species of life on the evolutionary scale, but if a goat is sacrificed to the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, he is immediately promoted to the human form. The mantra also says, \u201cYou have the right to kill this man who is sacrificing you.\u201d The wordm\u0101\u1e41saindicates that in his next birth, the goat will eat the flesh of the man who is presently sacrificing him. This in itself should bring the goat-eater to his senses. He should consider, \u201cWhy am I eating this flesh? Why am I doing this?

If your father is just a void, if he is not a person, how can you be a person? If your father has no form, how can you have form? This is not very difficult; it is just a common sense question.

It is also stated that although God has neither eyes nor ears, He can see and hear everything. These are apparent contradictions, but they are meant to teach us an important lesson. When we speak of seeing, we think of material vision. Due to our material conception, we think that the eyes of God must be like ours. Therefore, in order to remove these material conceptions, the Vedic literatures say that God has no hands, legs, eyes, ears, etc. God has eyes, but His vision is infinite. He can see in darkness, and He can see everywhere at once; therefore He has different eyes. Similarly, God has ears and can hear. He may be in His kingdom, millions and millions of miles away, but He can hear us whispering, because He is sitting within. We cannot avoid God\u2019s seeing, hearing, or touching.",

It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship.

He is supreme spirit, and the process of realizing Him is also beyond material considerations. Therefore, one may be a very learned scholar and still not be able to understand God. One should not think that because he is very poor he cannot realize God; nor should one think that he can realize God just because he is very rich. God may be understood by an uneducated person and misunderstood by one with great education. The understanding of God, like God Himself, is unconditional (apratihata).",

We should not think, \u201cOh, God gives me my daily bread; therefore I love God.\u201d God gives daily bread even to the cats and dogs. Since He is the father of everyone, He is supplying everyone food. So loving God for daily bread is not love. Love is without reason.

As Lord Jesus Christ said, we should hate the sin, not the sinner. That is a very nice statement, because the sinner is under illusion. He is mad. If we hate him, how can we deliver him? Therefore, those who are advanced devotees, who are really servants of God, do not hate anyone. When Lord Jesus Christ was being crucified, he said, \u201cMy God, forgive them.

            "In this chapter, in which the Lord is teaching the principles of the yoga system, He here points out that a transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self. \u201cThe Supreme Self\u201d refers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord. As explained before (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m), God is the supreme eternal, the supreme living entity, the Supreme Self. The purpose of the entire yoga system is to concentrate the mind on this Supreme Self. We are not the Supreme Self. That should be understood. The Supreme Self is God. This isdvaita-v\u0101da\u2013 duality. Duality means that God is different from me. He is supreme, and I am subordinate. He is great, and I am small. He is infinite, and I am infinitesimal. This is the relationship between ourselves and God as we should understand it. Because we are infinitesimal, we should concentrate our mind on the infinite Supreme Self. In order to do this, we should live alone, and \u201cliving alone\u201d means that we should not live with those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Ideally, this means that one should live in a secluded place, like a forest or a jungle, but in this age such a secluded place is very difficult to find. Therefore \u201csecluded place\u201d refers to that place where God consciousness is taught.",
            "The transcendentalist should also carefully control his mind, and this means fixing the mind on the Supreme Self, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As explained before, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like the sun, and if the mind is fixed on Him, there is no question of darkness. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always on our minds,m\u0101y\u0101,or illusion, can never enter. This is the process of concentration.",
            "The transcendentalist should also be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness. People are materially diseased because they desire things and want to possess them. We desire that which we do not have and we lament for that which we have lost.Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101.One who is actually God conscious does not desire material possessions. He has only one desire \u2013 to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not possible to give up desire, but itispossible to purify our desires. It is the nature of the living entity to have some desire, but in the conditioned state, one\u2019s desire is contaminated. Conditioned, one thinks, \u201cI desire to satisfy my senses by material possession.\u201d Purified desire is desire for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if we desire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, desires for material possessions will automatically vanish.",

So how is this possible in this age? How many people are prepared to find such a sacred place? In order to earn one\u2019s livelihood, one has to live in a congested city. There is no question of finding a sacred place, but for the practice of yoga, that is the first prerequisite.",
            "Therefore in thisbhakti-yogasystem, the temple is considered the sacred place. The temple isnirgu\u1e47a \u2013transcendental. According to theVedas,a city is in the mode of passion and a forest is in the mode of goodness. The temple, however, is transcendental. If you live in a city or town, you live in a place where passion is predominant, and if you want to escape this, you may go to a forest, a place of goodness. God\u2019s temple, however, is above passion and goodness; therefore the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only secluded place for this age. In this age, it is not possible to retreat to a forest; nor is it useful to make a show of practicing yoga in so-called yoga societies and at the same time engage in nonsense.",
            "Therefore, in theB\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said that in Kali-yuga, when people are generally short-lived, slow in spiritual realization, and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy names of the Lord.",

I meditate upon Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode. which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.\u201d",
            "Thus from the very beginning of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthe Absolute Truth is proclaimed to be cognizant. He is not dead or void.

I may claim, \u201cThis is my head,\u201d but if someone asks me, \u201cDo you know how many hairs are on your head?\u201d I will not be able to reply. Of course, this kind of knowledge is not transcendental, but in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth knows everything, directly and indirectly. I may know that I am eating, but I do not know the intricacies of the eating process \u2013 how my body is exactly assimilating food, how the blood is passing through my veins, etc. I am cognizant that my body is functioning, but I do not know how these processes are working perfectly and all at once. This is because my knowledge is limited.",
            "By definition, God is He who knows everything. He knows what is going on in every corner of His creation; therefore, from the very beginning,\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamexplains that the Supreme Truth from whom everything is emanating is supremely cognizant (abhij\u00f1a\u1e25). One may ask, \u201cIf the Absolute Truth is so powerful, wise, and cognizant, He must have attained this knowledge from some similar being.\u201d This is not the case. If He attains His knowledge from someone else, He is not God.Svar\u0101\u1e6d.He is independent, and His knowledge is automatically there.",

By thej\u00f1\u0101na-yogasystem, one attempts to understand the nature of the Absolute Truth in a philosophical way. In thebhakti-yogasystem, the target is the same. The methodology, however, is somewhat different. Whereas thej\u00f1\u0101n\u012battempts to concentrate his mind philosophically on the Supreme, thebhaktasimply engages himself in the service of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord reveals Himself. Thej\u00f1\u0101namethod is called the ascending process, and thebhaktimethod is called the descending process. If we are in the darkness of night, we may attempt to attain the sunlight by ascending in a powerful rocket. According to the descending process, however, we simply await the sunrise, and then we understand immediately.",
            "Through the ascending process, we attempt to reach the Supreme through our own endeavor, through the process of induction. By induction, we may attempt to find out whether man is mortal by studying thousands of men, trying to see whether they are mortal or immortal. This, of course, will take a great deal of time. If, however, I accept from superior authority the fact that all men are mortal, my knowledge is complete and immediate. Thus it is stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(10.14.29), \u201cMy dear Lord, a person who has received a little favor from You can understand You very quickly. But those who are trying to understand You by the ascending process may go on speculating for millions of years and still never understand You.\u201d",

            "\u201cOne should hold one\u2019s body, neck, and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.\u201d Yoga does not mean going to some class, paying some money, engaging in gymnastics, and then returning home to drink, smoke, and engage in sex. Such yoga is practiced by societies of the cheaters and the cheated. The authoritative yoga system is here outlined by the supreme authority, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Is there a better yogi than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead? First of all, one has to go alone to a holy place and sit in a straight line, holding one\u2019s body, neck, and head erect, and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Why is this? This is a method to help concentrate one\u2019s mind. That\u2019s all. The real purpose of yoga, however, is to keep oneself always aware that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is within.",
            "One of the dangers of sitting in meditation and staring at the tip of one\u2019s nose is that one will fall asleep. I have seen many so-called meditators sitting like this and snoring. As soon as one closes his eyes, it is natural to feel sleepy; therefore it is recommended that the eyes are half closed. Thus it is said that one should look at the tip of his nose. With one\u2019s sight thus concentrated, the mind should be subdued and unagitated. In India, the yogi often goes to a jungle to practice such meditation in solitude. But in a jungle, the yogi may think, \u201cMaybe some tiger or snake is coming. What is that noise?\u201d In this way, his mind may be agitated; therefore it is especially stated that the yogi must be \u201cdevoid of fear.\u201d A deerskin is especially recommended as a yoga asana, because it contains a chemical property that repels snakes; thus the yogi will not be disturbed by serpents. Whatever the case \u2013 serpents, tigers, or lions \u2013 one can be truly fearless only when he is established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Due to perverted memory, the conditioned soul is naturally fearful. Fear is due to forgetting one\u2019s eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(11.2.37):bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2019sm\u1e5bti\u1e25.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness provides the only true basis for fearlessness; therefore perfect practice of yoga is not possible for one who is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
            "The yogi must also be \u201ccompletely free from sex life.\u201d If one indulges in sex, he cannot concentrate; thereforebrahmacarya,complete celibacy, is recommended to make the mind steady. By practicing celibacy, one cultivates determination. One modern example of such determination is that of Mahatma Gandhi, who was determined to resist the powerful British empire by means of nonviolence. At this time, India was dependent on the British, and the people had no weapons. The Britishers, being more powerful, easily cut down whatever violent revolutions the people attempted. Therefore Gandhi resorted to nonviolence, noncooperation. \u201cI shall not fight with the Britishers,\u201d he declared, \u201cand even if they react with violence, I shall remain nonviolent. In this way the world will sympathize with us.\u201d Such a policy required a great amount of determination, and Gandhi\u2019s determination was very strong because he was abrahmac\u0101r\u012b.Although he had children and a wife, he renounced sex at the age of thirty-six. It was this sexual renunciation that enabled him to be so determined that he was able to lead his country and drive the British from India.",
            "Thus, refraining from sex enables one to be very determined and powerful. It is not necessary to do anything else. This is a secret people are not aware of. If you want to do something with determination, you have to refrain from sex. Regardless of the process \u2013 be itha\u1e6dha-yoga, bhakti-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,or whatever \u2013 sex indulgence is not allowed. Sex is allowed only for householders who want to beget good children and raise them in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sex is not meant for sense enjoyment, although enjoyment is there by nature. Unless there is some enjoyment, why should one assume the responsibility of begetting children? That is the secret of nature\u2019s gift, but we should not take advantage of it. These are the secrets of life. By taking advantage and indulging in sex life, we are simply wasting our time. If one tells you that you can indulge in sex as much as you like and at the same time become a yogi, he is cheating you. If some so-called guru tells you to give him money in exchange for some mantra and that you can go on and engage in all kinds of nonsense, he is just cheating you. Because we want something sublime and yet want it cheaply, we put ourselves in a position to be cheated. This means that we actually want to be cheated. If we want something valuable, we must pay for it. We cannot expect to walk into a jewelry store and demand the most valuable jewel for a mere ten cents. No, we must pay a great deal. Similarly, if we want perfection in yoga, we have to pay by abstaining from sex. Perfection in yoga is not something childish, and theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101instructs us that if we try to make yoga into something childish, we will be cheated. There are many cheaters awaiting us, waiting to take our money, giving us nothing, and then leaving. But according to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s authoritative statement in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,one must be \u201ccompletely free from sex life.\u201d Being free from sex, one should \u201cmeditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.\u201d This is real meditation.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not recommend meditation on the void. He specifically states, \u201cmeditate upon Me.\u201d Thevi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brtiis situated in one\u2019s heart, and meditation upon Him is the object of yoga. This is thes\u0101\u1e45khya-yogasystem, as first practiced by Lord Kapiladeva, an incarnation of God. By sitting straight, staring steadily at the tip of one\u2019s nose, subduing one\u2019s mind, and abstaining from sex, one may be able to concentrate the mind on thevi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brtisituated within the heart. When we refer to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form, orvi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti,we refer to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

The members of this movement are concentrating their minds on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, regardless of their particular occupation. One may be working in the garden and digging in the earth, but he is thinking, \u201cI am cultivating beautiful roses to offer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d One may be cooking in the kitchen, but he is always thinking, \u201cI am preparing palatable food to be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Similarly, chanting and dancing in the temple are forms of meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the boys and girls in this Society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are perfect yogis because they are meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day.

            "It is stated in Sanskrit in this verse,\u015b\u0101nti\u1e41 nirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101m;that is, one attains peace throughnirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101m,or the cessation of material activities.Nirv\u0101\u1e47adoes not refer to the void, but to putting an end to materialistic activities. Unless one puts an end to them, there is no question of peace. When Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked his five-year-old son Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cMy dear boy, what is the best thing you have thus far learned?\u201d Prahl\u0101da immediately replied,tat s\u0101dhu manye \u2019sura-varya dehin\u0101\u1e41 sad\u0101 samudvigna-dhiy\u0101m asad-grah\u0101t:\u201cMy dear father, O greatest of the demons, materialistic people are always full of anxiety because they have accepted as real that which is nonpermanent.\u201d The wordasad-grah\u0101tis important because it indicates that materialists are always hankering to capture or possess something that is nonpermanent. History affords us many examples. Mr. Kennedy was a very rich man who wanted to become president, and he spent a great deal of money to attain that elevated position. Yet although he had a nice wife, children, and the presidency, everything was finished within a second. In the material world, people are always trying to capture something that is nonpermanent. Unfortunately, people do not come to their senses and realize, \u201cI am permanent. I am spirit soul. Why am I hankering after something that is nonpermanent?\u201d",
            "We are always busy acquiring comforts for this body without considering that today, tomorrow, or in a hundred years this body will be finished. As far as the real \u201cI\u201d is concerned, \u201cI am spirit soul. I have no birth. I have no death. What, then, is my proper function?\u201d When we act on the material platform, we are engaged in bodily functions; therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says that people are anxious because all their activities are targeted to capturing and possessing something nonpermanent. All living entities \u2013 men, beasts, birds, or whatever \u2013 are always full of anxiety, and this is the material disease. If we are always full of anxiety, how can we attain peace? People may live in a very nice house, but out front they place signs saying, \u201cBeware of Dog,\u201d or \u201cNo Trespassers.\u201d This means that although they are living comfortably, they are anxious that someone will come and molest them. Sitting in an office and earning a very good salary, a man is always thinking, \u201cOh, I hope I don\u2019t lose this position.\u201d The American nation is very rich, but because of this, it has to maintain a great defense force. So who is free from anxiety? The conclusion is that if we want peace without anxiety, we have to come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There is no alternative.",
            "In order to attain peace, we must meditate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and by meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we can control the body. The first part of the body to control is the tongue, and the next part is the genital. When these are controlled, everything is controlled. The tongue is controlled by chanting and eatingk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da.As soon as the tongue is controlled, the stomach is controlled, and next the genitals are controlled. Actually, controlling the body and mind is a very simple process. When the mind is fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and has no other engagement, it is automatically controlled. Activities should always be centered on working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 gardening, typing, cooking, cleaning, whatever. By engaging the body, mind, and activities in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one attains the supremenirv\u0101\u1e47a,which abides in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everything is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore we cannot find peace outside K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities.",
            "The ultimate goal of yoga is thus clearly explained. Yoga is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. As long as we require some material facilities, we will get them. But these facilities will not solve the problems of life. I have traveled throughout the world, and it is my opinion that American boys and girls have the best material facilities, but does this mean that they have attained peace? Can anyone say, \u201cYes, I am completely peaceful\u201d? If this is so, why are American youngsters so frustrated and confused?",
            "As long as we practice yoga in order to attain some material facility, there will be no question of peace. Yoga should only be practiced in order to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yoga is meant for the reestablishment of our lost relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Generally, one joins a yoga society in order to improve his health, to reduce fat. People in rich nations eat more, become fat, and then pay exorbitant prices to so-called yoga instructors in order to reduce. People try to reduce by all these artificial gymnastics; they do not understand that if they just eat vegetables or fruits and grains, they will never get fat. People get fat because they eat voraciously, because they eat meat. People who eat voraciously suffer from diabetes, overweight, heart attacks, etc., and those who eat insufficiently suffer from tuberculosis. Therefore moderation is required, and moderation in eating means that we eat only what is needed to keep body and soul together. If we eat more than we need or less, we will become diseased.

            "In thisBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,information of the spiritual sky is given. How can we know anything about that which we cannot reach? Our senses are so imperfect, how can we attain knowledge? We just have to hear and accept. How will we ever know who our father is unless we accept the word of our mother? Our mother says, \u201cHere is your father,\u201d and we have to accept this. We cannot determine our father by making inquiries here and there or by attempting to experiment. This knowledge is beyond our means. Similarly, if we want to learn about the spiritual sky, God\u2019s kingdom, we have to hear from the authority, motherVedas.TheVedasare calledveda-m\u0101t\u0101,or motherVedas,because the knowledge imparted therein is like that knowledge received from the mother. Wehaveto believe in order to acquire knowledge. There is no possibility of acquiring this transcendental knowledge by experimenting with our imperfect senses.",
            "A consummate yogi, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly stated herein (\u015b\u0101nti\u1e41 nirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101\u1e41 mat-sa\u1e41sth\u0101m adhigacchati) by the Lord Himself, can attain real peace and ultimately reach the supreme abode of the Lord. This abode is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101it is clearly stated (goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25) that the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well, by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode of the Lord (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) without properly understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. And according toBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,it is necessary to learn from our authorized mother,veda-m\u0101t\u0101. Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101states that the Supreme Lord is living not only in His abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, but everywhere:goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25.He is like the sun, which is millions of miles away and yet is still present within this room.",
            "In conclusion, the person who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yogi, because his mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities.Sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25.In theVedaswe also learn,tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti:\u201cOne can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Thus perfection of yoga is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feat to befool innocent people.",
            "In this system of yoga, moderation is required; therefore it is stated that we should not eat too much or too little, sleep too much or too little, or work too much or too little. All these activities are there because we have to execute the yoga system with this material body. In other words, we have to make the best use of a bad bargain. The material body is a bad bargain in the sense that it is the source of all miseries. The spirit soul does not experience misery, and the normal condition of the living entity is his healthy, spiritual life. Misery and disease occur due to material contamination, disease, infection. So in a sense, material existence is a diseased condition of the soul. And what is that disease? The answer is not a great mystery. The disease is this body. This body is actually not meant for me. It may be \u201cmy\u201d body, but it is a symptom of my diseased condition. In any case, I should identify with this body no more than I should identify with my clothes. In this world, we are all differently dressed. We are dressed as red men, brown men, white men, black men, yellow men, etc., or as Indians, Americans, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc. All these designations are not symptomatic of our actual position but of our diseased condition. The yoga system is meant to cure this disease by connecting us again with the Supreme.",
            "We are meant to be connected with the Supreme just as our hand is meant to be connected to our body. We are part and parcel of the Supreme, just as the hand is part and parcel of the body. When the hand is severed from the body, it is valueless, but when it is joined to the body, it is invaluable. Similarly, in this material condition, we are disconnected from God. Actually, the worddisconnectedis not precise, because the connection is always there. God is always supplying all our necessities. Since nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we cannot be disconnected from Him. Rather, it is better to say that we have forgotten that we are connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because of this forgetfulness, we have entered the criminal department of the universe. The government still takes care of its criminals, but they are legally disconnected from the civilian state. Our disconnection is a result of our engaging in so many nonsensical activities instead of utilizing our senses in the performance of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious duties.",
            "Instead of thinking, \u201cI am the eternal servant of God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d we are thinking, \u201cI am the servant of my society, my country, my husband, my wife, my dog, or whatever.\u201d This is called forgetfulness. How has this come about? All these misconceptions have arisen due to this body. Because I was born in America, I am thinking that I am an American. Each society teaches its citizens to think in this way. Because I am thinking that I am an American, the American government can tell me, \u201cCome and fight. Give your life for your country.\u201d This is all due to the bodily conception; therefore an intelligent person should know that he is suffering miseries due to his body and that he should not act in such a way that he will continue to be imprisoned within a material body birth after birth. According to thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,there are 8,400,000 species of life, and all are but different forms of contamination \u2013 whether one has an American body, an Indian body, a dog\u2019s body, a hog\u2019s body, or whatever. Therefore the first instruction in yoga is, \u201cI am not this body.\u201d",
            "Attaining liberation from the contamination of the material body is the first teaching of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In the second chapter, after Arjuna told \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cI shall not fight,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cWhile speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01012.11)In other words, Arjuna was thinking on the bodily platform. He wanted to leave the battlefield because he did not want to fight with his relatives. All his conceptions were within the bodily atmosphere; therefore after Arjuna accepted \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master, the Lord immediately chastised him, just as a master chastises his disciple in order to teach him. Essentially, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Arjuna, \u201cYou are talking very wisely, as if you know so many things, but actually you are speaking nonsense, because you are speaking from the bodily position.\u201d Similarly, people throughout the world are posing themselves as highly advanced in education, science, philosophy, politics, etc., but their position is on the bodily platform.",
            "A vulture may rise very high in the sky \u2013 seven or eight miles \u2013 and it is wonderful to see him fly in this way. He also has powerful eyes, for he can spot a carcass from a great distance. Yet what is the object of all these great qualifications? A dead body, a rotting carcass. His perfection is just to discover a dead piece of meat and eat it. That\u2019s all. Similarly, we may have a very high education, but what is our objective? Sense enjoyment, the enjoyment of this material body. We may rise very high with our spaceships, but what is the purpose? Sense gratification, that\u2019s all. This means that all the striving and all this high education are merely on the animal platform.",
            "Therefore we should first of all know that our miserable material condition is due to this body. At the same time, we should know that this body is not permanent. Although I identify with my body, family, society, country, and so many other things, how long will these objects exist? They are not permanent.Asatis a word meaning that they will cease to exist.Asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25:\u201cThe body is simply troublesome and impermanent.\u201d",
            "Many people come to us saying, \u201cSwamij\u012b, my position is so troublesome,\u201d but as soon as we suggest the medicine, they will not accept it. This means that people want to manufacture their own medicine. Why do we go to a physician if we want to treat ourselves? People want to accept only what they think is palatable.",
            "Although we are suggesting that this body is useless and is a form of contamination, we are not recommending that it be abused. We may use a car to carry us to work, but this does not mean that we should not take care of the car. We should take care of the car for it to carry us to and fro, but we should not become so attached to it that we are polishing it every day. We must utilize this material body in order to execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and to this end we should keep it fit and healthy, but we should not become too attached to it. That is calledyukta-vair\u0101gya.The body should not be neglected. We should bathe regularly, eat regularly, sleep regularly in order to keep mind and body healthy. Some people say that the body should be renounced and that we should take some drugs and abandon ourselves to intoxication, but this is not a yoga process. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given us nice food \u2013 fruits, grains, vegetables, and milk \u2013 and we can prepare hundreds and thousands of nice preparations and offer them to the Lord. Our process is to eatk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101daand to satisfy the tongue in that way. But we should not be greedy and eat dozens ofsamos\u0101s,sweetballs, andrasagull\u0101s.No. We should eat and sleep just enough to keep the body fit, and no more. It is stated,",

            "\u201cHe who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation, and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.17)",
            "Although we should minimize our eating and sleeping, we should not attempt this too rapidly, at the risk of becoming sick. Because people are accustomed to eating voraciously, there are prescriptions for fasting. We can reduce our sleeping and eating, but we should remain in good health for spiritual purposes. We should not attempt to reduce eating and sleeping too rapidly or artificially; when we advance we will naturally not feel pain due to the reduction of these natural bodily processes. In this respect, Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b offers a good example. Although a very rich man\u2019s son, Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa left his home to join Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Because he was the only son, Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa was very beloved by his father. Understanding that his son had gone to Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b to join Lord Caitanya, the father sent four servants with money to attend him. At first, Raghun\u0101tha accepted the money, thinking, \u201cOh, since my father has sent all this money, I will accept it and invite all thesanny\u0101s\u012bsto feast.\u201d",
            "After some time, however, the feasts came to an end. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu then inquired from His secretary, Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara, \u201cNowadays I don\u2019t receive any invitations from Raghun\u0101tha. What has happened?\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is because Raghun\u0101tha has stopped accepting his father\u2019s money.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, that\u2019s very nice,\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said.",
            "\u201cRaghun\u0101tha was thinking, \u2018Although I have renounced everything, I am still enjoying my father\u2019s money. This is hypocritical.\u2019 Therefore he has told the servants to go home and has refused the money.\u201d",
            "\u201cSo how is he living?\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu inquired.",
            "\u201cOh, he\u2019s standing on the steps of the Jagann\u0101tha temple, and when the priests pass him on their way home, they offer him somepras\u0101da.In this way, he is satisfied.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is very nice,\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu commented.",
            "Regularly going to the Jagann\u0101tha temple, Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu would see Raghun\u0101tha standing on the steps. After a few days, however, He no longer saw him there. Therefore the Lord commented to His secretary, \u201cI no longer see Raghun\u0101tha standing on the temple steps.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe has given that up,\u201d Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara explained. \u201cHe was thinking, \u2018Oh, I am standing here just like a prostitute, waiting for someone to come and give me food. No. I don\u2019t like this at all.\u2019 \u201d",
            "\u201cThat is very nice,\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, \u201cbut how is he eating?\u201d",
            "\u201cEvery day he is collecting some rejected rice from the kitchen and is eating that.\u201d",
            "To encourage Raghun\u0101tha, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu one day visited him. \u201cRaghun\u0101tha,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cI hear that you are eating very palatable food. Why are you not inviting Me?\u201d",
            "Raghun\u0101tha did not reply, but the Lord quickly found the place where he kept the rice, and the Lord immediately took some and began to eat it.",
            "\u201cDear Lord,\u201d Raghun\u0101tha implored, \u201cplease do not eat this. It is not fit for You.\u201d",

            "Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu enacted this pastime just to discourage Raghun\u0101tha from thinking, \u201cI am eating this miserable, rejected rice.\u201d Through the Lord\u2019s encouragement, Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b reduced his daily quantity of food until he was finally eating only one pat of butter every other day. And every day he was also bowing down hundreds of times and constantly chanting the holy names.Sa\u1e45khy\u0101-p\u016brvaka-n\u0101ma-g\u0101na-natibhi\u1e25 k\u0101l\u0101vas\u0101n\u012b-k\u1e5btau.",
            "Although this is an excellent example of minimizing all material necessities, we should not try to imitate it. It is not possible for an ordinary man to imitate Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who was one of the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, a highly elevated associate of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu Himself. Each one of the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs displayed a unique example of how one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but it is not our duty to imitate them. We should just try to follow, as far as possible, in their footsteps. If we immediately try to become like Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b by imitating him, we are sure to fail, and whatever progress we have made will be defeated. Therefore the Lord says(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.16)that there is no possibility of one\u2019s becoming a yogi if one eats too much or too little.",
            "The same moderation applies to sleep. Presently I may be sleeping ten hours a day, but if I can keep myself fit by sleeping five hours, why sleep ten? As far as the body is concerned, there are four demands \u2013 eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. The problem with modern civilization is that it is trying to increase these demands, but they should be decreased instead. Eat what we need, and sleep when we need, and our health will be excellent. There is no question of artificial imitation.",

            "I have often used the example of a restless child. Since it is impossible to make such a child motionless, it is necessary to give him some playthings or some pictures to look at. In this way, he will be engaged, or motionless in the sense that he will not be committing some mischief. But if one really wants to make him motionless, one must give him some engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Then there will be no scope for mischievous activities, due to realization in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. To be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should first realize, \u201cI am K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. I am not this matter. I am not of this nation or of this society. I do not belong to this rascal or that rascal. I am simply K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s.\u201d This is motionless; this is full knowledge, realizing our actual position as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u010115.7,mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke:\u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.\u201d As soon as we understand this, we immediately cease our material activities, and this is what is meant by being motionless.

The Superself and the self enjoy together. Enjoyment cannot be alone; there must be two. What experience do we have of solitary enjoyment? Solitary enjoyment is not possible. Enjoyment means two: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the Supersoul, and the individual soul.",
            "If one is convinced that \u201cI am part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d one is not disturbed even in the midst of the greatest difficulties, because one knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give protection. That is surrender. To attain this position, one must try his best, use his intelligence, and believe in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.B\u0101lasya neha \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 pitarau n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha(\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam7.9.19). If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not protect us, nothing can save us. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a neglects us, there is no remedy, and whatever measures we take to try to protect ourselves will be ultimately defeated. There may be many expert physicians treating a diseased man, but that is no guarantee that he will live. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so wills, a person will die despite the best physicians and medicines. On the other hand, if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is protecting us, we will survive even without medical treatment. When one is fully surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he becomes happy, knowing that regardless of the situation, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect him.

But if we try to act on our own and at our own risk, how can we be happy? Happiness means being in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and being convinced that \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give me protection,\u201d and being true to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not possible to be happy otherwise.",

Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s protection, we cannot live for a second. When we admit and recognize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s kindness, we become happy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is protecting us at every moment, but we do not realize this, because we have taken life at our own risk. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives us a certain amount of freedom, saying, \u201cAll right, do whatever you like. As far as possible, I will give you protection.\u201d However, when the living entity is fully surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes total charge and gives special protection. If a child grows up and doesn\u2019t care for his father and acts freely, what can his father do? He can only say, \u201cDo whatever you like.\u201d But when a son puts himself fully under his father\u2019s protection, he receives more care. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in the ninth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.29),",

Since all living entities are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons, He is everyone\u2019s friend. Unfortunately, we are not taking advantage of His friendship, and that is our disease. Once we recognize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as our eternal father and friend, we can understand that He is always protecting us, and in this way we can be happy.",

Celibacy makes one\u2019s determination strong; therefore, from the very beginning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that the yogi does not engage in sex. If one indulges in sex, one\u2019s determination will be flickering. Therefore sex life should be controlled according to the rules and regulations governing theg\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama,or sex should be given up altogether. Actually, it should be given up altogether, but if this is not possible, it should be controlled. Then determination will come because, after all, determination is a bodily affair. Determination means continuing to practice K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with patience and perseverance. If one does not immediately attain the desired results, one should not think, \u201cOh, what is this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?

I must have a child immediately.\u201d But how is this possible? The girl must have patience, become a faithful wife, serve her husband, and let her love grow. Eventually, because she is married, it is certain that she will have a child. Similarly, when we are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our perfection is guaranteed, but we must have patience and determination. We should think, \u201cI must execute my duties and should not be impatient.\u201d Impatience is due to loss of determination, and loss of determination is due to excessive sex.",

One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perseverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success.

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and when at last Garu\u1e0da, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it, he became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see her. Garu\u1e0da was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu\u1e0da at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened by this, and returned the eggs.

Just as there are different types of people, there are three classes of devotees. In the third class are those who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has no knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the scriptures like the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamandBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Sometimes these third-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency towardkarma-yogaorj\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection ofkarma-yogaorj\u00f1\u0101na-yogais vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into three stages and described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,in the Eleventh Canto.",

Do you have all these symptoms?\u201d Because people do not make such inquiries, they are cheated. Therefore it is necessary to be fixed in consciousness of the Self.

Then, even if the mind is diverted, it will be forced to concentrate on the sound vibration \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d It isn\u2019t necessary to withdraw the mind from everything; it will automatically be withdrawn, because it will be concentrated on the sound vibration. If we hear an automobile pass, our attention is automatically diverted. Similarly, if we constantly chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, our mind will automatically be fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although we are accustomed to think of so many other things.",
            "The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized yogi has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. At the present moment, the mind is controlling us (go-d\u0101sa). The mind is telling us, \u201cPlease, why not look at that beautiful girl?\u201d and so we look. It says, \u201cWhy not drink that nice liquor?\u201d and we say, \u201cYes.\u201d It says, \u201cWhy not smoke this cigarette?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d we say. \u201cWhy not go to this restaurant for such palatable food? Why not do this? Why not do that?\u201d In this way, the mind is dictating, and we are following. Material life means being controlled by the senses, or the mind, which is the center of all the senses. Being controlled by the mind means being controlled by the senses, because the senses are the mind\u2019s assistants. The master mind dictates, \u201cGo see that,\u201d and the eyes, following the directions of the mind, look at the sense object. The mind tells us to go to a certain place, and the legs, under the mind\u2019s directions, carry us there. Thus, being under the direction of the mind means coming under the control of the senses. If we can control the mind, we will not be under the control of the senses. One who is under the control of the senses is known asgo-d\u0101sa.The wordgomeans \u201csenses,\u201d andd\u0101sameans \u201cservant.\u201d One who is master of the senses is calledgosv\u0101m\u012b,becausesv\u0101m\u012bmeans \u201cmaster.\u201d Therefore, one who has the titlegosv\u0101m\u012bis one who has mastered the senses. As long as one is servant of the senses, he cannot be called agosv\u0101m\u012borsv\u0101m\u012b.Unless one masters the senses, his acceptance of the titlesv\u0101m\u012borgosv\u0101m\u012bis just a form of cheating. It was R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b who thus defined the meaning of the wordgosv\u0101m\u012b.Originally, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b and R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b were notgosv\u0101m\u012bsbut were government ministers. It was only when they became disciples of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu that they becamegosv\u0101m\u012bs.Sogosv\u0101m\u012bis not a hereditary title but a qualification. One becomes so qualified under the directions of a bona fide spiritual master. Only when one has attained perfection in sense control can he be called agosv\u0101m\u012band become a spiritual master in his turn. Unless one can master the senses, he will simply be a bogus spiritual master.",
            "This is explained by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in hisUpade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta(1):",

This pushing is a kind of impetus. For instance, when nature calls, we have to go to the toilet, and we cannot check this urge. So this urge is calledvegam,a kind of pushing. According to R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, there are sixvegams. V\u0101co vegamis the urge to talk unnecessarily. That is a kind of pushing of the tongue. Then there iskrodha-vegam,the urge to become angry. When we are pushed to anger, we cannot check ourselves, and sometimes men become so angry that they commit murder. Similarly, the mind is pushing, dictating, \u201cYou must go there at once,\u201d and we immediately go where we are told. The wordjihv\u0101-vegamrefers to the tongue\u2019s being urged to taste palatable foods.Udara-vegamrefers to the urges of the belly. Although the belly is full, it still wants more food, and that is a kind of pushing of the belly. And when we yield to the pushings of the tongue and the belly, the urges of the genitals become very strong, and sex is required. If one does not control his mind or his tongue, how can he control his genitals? In this way, there are so many pushings, so much so that the body is a kind of pushing machine. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore tells us that one can become a spiritual master only when he can control all these urges.",
            "Et\u0101n veg\u0101n yo vi\u1e63aheta dh\u012bra\u1e25 sarv\u0101m ap\u012bm\u0101\u1e41 p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u1e41 sa \u015bi\u1e63y\u0101t:\u201cOne who can control the pushings and remain steady can make disciples all over the world.\u201d The worddh\u012brameans \u201csteady, sober.\u201d Only one who is adh\u012brais qualified to make disciples. This all depends on one\u2019s training. Indeed, yoga means training the mind and the senses to be fixed on the Self. This is not possible by meditating only fifteen minutes a day and then going out and doing whatever the senses dictate. How can the problems of life be solved so cheaply? If we want something precious, we have to pay for it. By the grace of Lord Caitanya, this payment has been made very easy \u2013 just chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By our chanting, this system of control, this yoga system, becomes perfected.Ih\u0101 haite sarva siddhi haibe tom\u0101ra.Thus Lord Caitanya has blessed us. Simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we will achieve the perfection of self-realization. In this age of Kali-yuga, when people are so fallen, other processes will not be successful. This is the only process, and it is easy, sublime, effective, and practical. By it, one can realize oneself.",
            "According to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the ninth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.2), this process is the most sublime.",

            "A true yogi, as explained before, is the devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the most advanced devotee goes forth to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Why? Because he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in all beings. How is this? Because he sees that all beings are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He also understands that since these beings have forgotten K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is his duty to awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes missionaries go forth to educate primitive, uneducated people just because they see that they are human beings and so deserve to be educated in order to understand the value of life. This is due to the missionary\u2019s sympathy. The devotee is similarly motivated. He understands that everyone should know himself to be part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee understands that people are suffering due to their forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Thus the devotee sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in everything. He is not under the illusion that everything has become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Rather, he sees every living being as the son of God. If I say that this boy is the son of Mr. Johnson, do I mean that this boy is Mr. Johnson himself? I may see Mr. Johnson in this boy because this boy is his son, but the distinction remains. If I see every living being as the son of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in every being. This should not be difficult to understand. It is neither an association nor a vision but a fact.",
            "When a devotee sees a cat or a dog, he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in him. He knows that a cat, for instance, is a living being, and that due to his past deeds he has received the body of a cat. This is due to his forgetfulness. The devotee helps the cat by giving it somek\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101daso that someday the cat will come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the cat. The devotee does not think, \u201cOh, here is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Let me embrace this cat and serve this cat as God.\u201d Such thinking is nonsensical. If one sees a tiger, he does not say, \u201cOh, here is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Come on, please eat me.\u201d The devotee does not embrace all beings as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but rather sympathizes with every living being because he sees all beings as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this way, \u201cthe true yogi observes Me in all beings.\u201d This is real vision.",
            "Whatever is done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, knowingly or unknowingly, will have its effect. Children who bow down or try to vibrate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s names or clap duringk\u012brtanaare actually accumulating so much in their bank account of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

He is a child and does not know.\u201d No, the fire will always act as fire. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme spirit, and if a child partakes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he will be affected. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will act, whether the child knows or does not know. Every living being should be given a chance to partake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is there and will act. Therefore everyone is being invited to come and takepras\u0101da,because thispras\u0101dawill someday take effect.",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-pervading. Why is He to be seen only in human beings?

This is possible because the true yogi knows that everything that we see is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We are sitting on this floor or on this carpet, but in actuality we are sitting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We should know this to be a fact. How is this carpet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? It is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because it is made of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. The Supreme Lord has various energies, of which there are three primary divisions \u2013 material energy, spiritual energy, and marginal energy.Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate.We living entities are marginal energy, the material world is material energy, and the spiritual world is spiritual energy. We are marginal energy in the sense that we can be either spiritually or materially situated. There is no third alternative; either we become materialistic or spiritualistic.",
            "As long as we are in the material world, we are seated on the material energy, and therefore we are situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy is not separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A flame contains both heat and illumination, two energies. Neither the heat nor the illumination are separate from the flame; therefore in one sense heat is fire, and illumination is fire, but they can be distinguished. Similarly, this material energy is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and although we are thinking that we are sitting on this floor, we are actually sitting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is stated, \u201cThe self-realized man sees Me everywhere.\u201d Seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere means seeing every living being as well as everything else in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

There are many ways not to lose sight of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we do not lose sight of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we will not be lost.",
            "A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness certainly sees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere, and he sees everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of everything \u2013 this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. How does the devotee know that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy? First of all, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is a philosopher. If he sees a tree, he thinks, \u201cWhat is this tree?\u201d He then sees that the tree has a material body \u2013 just as he has a material body \u2013 and that the tree is also a living entity, but due to the tree\u2019s past misdeeds, he has obtained such an abominable body that he cannot even move. The tree\u2019s body is material, material energy, and the devotee automatically questions, \u201cWhose energy? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. Therefore the tree is connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being a living entity, the tree is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In this way, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not see the tree, but sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a present. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: you don\u2019t see the tree. You see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the perfection of yoga, and that is alsosam\u0101dhi.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the development of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 a position transcendental even to material liberation. Why does the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person take such an account of the tree? Because he has love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If you love your child and your child is away, you think of him when you see his shoe. You think, \u201cOh, this is my dear child\u2019s shoe.\u201d It is not that you love the shoe, but the child. The shoe, however, evokes that love. Similarly, as soon as we see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy manifested in a living entity, we love that entity because we love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, if we love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, universal love is accounted for. Otherwise \u201cuniversal love\u201d is nonsensical, because it is not possible to love everybody without loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, universal love is automatically there. Without being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, a person may say, \u201cHere is my American brother, and here is my Indian brother. Now let us eat this cow.\u201d Such a person may look on other humans as brothers, but he looks on the cow as food. Is this universal love? A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, thinks, \u201cOh, here is a cow. Here is a dog. They are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but somehow or other they have acquired different bodies. This does not mean that they are not my brothers. How can I kill and eat my brothers?\u201d That is true universal love \u2013 rooted in love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no question of love at all.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the stage beyond self-realization in which the devotee becomes one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the sense that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of sight of the devotee. To merge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101(5.38),",

When Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u inhales, these millions of universes return within Him, and this is called the process of annihilation. That, in essence, is the position of these material universes: they come out from the body of Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then again return. In the ninth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.7)it is also indicated that these material universes are manifest at a certain period and are then annihilated.",

Brahm\u0101 lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when Brahm\u0101 dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. That is, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u inhales. Then again, when there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: \u201cAlthough I am one, I shall become many.\u201d This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place.",
            "Since the entire creation and annihilation of the material universes depend on the exhaling and inhaling of Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, we can hardly imagine the magnitude of that Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u. And yet it is said here that this Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u is but a plenary portion of the plenary portion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the original Govinda. Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into each universe as Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u further expands as K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and it is this Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form that enters into the heart of every living entity. In this way, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is manifest throughout the creation. Thus the yogis concentrate their minds on the K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form within the heart.

The yogi should know that this Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is not different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. For example, there is only one sun in the sky, but this sun may be reflected in millions of buckets of water. Or, one may ask millions and trillions of people, \u201cWhere is the sun?\u201d And each will say, \u201cOver my head.\u201d The sun is one, but it is reflected countless times. According to theVedas,the living entities are innumerable; there is no possibility of counting them. Just as the sun can be reflected in countless buckets of water, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can live in each and everyone\u2019s heart. It is this form that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary portion, and it is this form on which the yogi concentrates.",
            "One who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is already a perfect yogi. In fact, there is no difference between a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee always engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and a perfect yogi engaged in meditation on the Supersoul.

If we miss this opportunity, we suffer a great loss, for we have undergone the evolutionary process and have passed through more than eight million species of life in order to get this human form. We should therefore be conscious of this and careful not to miss this opportunity. We have a good body, the human form, and intelligence and civilization.

            "This is the crucial test of the eightfolda\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem expounded herein by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It has already been explained that one must sit in a certain way and concentrate the mind on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u seated within the heart. According to thea\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem, first of all one has to control the senses, follow all the rules and regulations, practice the sitting posture and the breathing process, concentrate the mind on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u within the heart, and then become absorbed in that form. There are eight processes in thisa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem, but herein Arjuna says quite frankly that thisa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem is very difficult. Indeed, he says that it \u201cappears impractical and unendurable to me.\u201d",
            "Actually, thea\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem is not impractical, for were it impractical, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have taken so much trouble to describe it. It is not impractical, but itappearsimpractical. What may be impractical for one man may be practical for another. Arjuna is representative of the common man in the sense that he is not a mendicant or asanny\u0101s\u012bor a scholar. He is on the battlefield fighting for his kingdom, and in this sense he is an ordinary man engaged in a worldly activity. He is concerned with earning a livelihood, supporting his family, and so on. Arjuna has many problems, just as the common man, and generally this system ofa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogais impractical for the ordinary common man. That is the point being made. It is practical for one who has already completely renounced everything and can sit in a secluded, sacred place on the side of a hill or in a cave. But who can do this in this age? Although Arjuna was a great warrior, a member of the royal family, and a very advanced person, he proclaims this yoga system impractical. And what are we in comparison to Arjuna? If we attempt this system, failure is certain.",
            "Therefore this system of mysticism described by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna beginning with the words\u015bucau de\u015beand ending withyog\u012b parama\u1e25is here rejected by Arjuna out of a feeling of inability. As stated before, it is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. As Kali-yuga progresses, our lifespan gets shorter and shorter. Our forefathers lived for a hundred years or more, but now people are dying at the age of sixty or seventy. Gradually the lifespan will decrease even further. Memory, mercy, and other good qualities will also decrease in this age.",
            "In Kali-yuga, people are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He was not prepared to become a pseudoyogi and practice some gymnastic feats. He was not a pretender but a soldier and a family man. Therefore he frankly admitted that for him this system of yoga would be a waste of time. Arjuna belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, when Arjuna was living, the lifespan was very long. At that time, people used to live up to one thousand years. In the present age of Kali-yuga, the lifespan is limited to a hundred years; in Dv\u0101para-yuga, the lifespan was a thousand years; in Tret\u0101-yuga, the lifespan was ten thousand years; and in Satya-yuga, the lifespan was one hundred thousand years. Thus as theyugasdegenerate, the lifespan decreases. Even though Arjuna was living at a time when one would live and practice meditation for a thousand years, he still considered this system impossible.",
            "Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore, this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of Kali. Of course, it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely ignorant of the desired goal.",
            "Since thisa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogasystem is considered impossible, thebhakti-yogasystem is recommended for everyone. Without training or education, one can automatically participate inbhakti-yoga.Even a small child can clap ink\u012brtana.Therefore Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has proclaimedbhakti-yogathe only system practical for this age.",

Just by saying the nameK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aand hearing it, the mind is automatically fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This means that the yoga system is immediately attained. The entire yoga system aims at concentration on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original personality from whom all these Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms are expanded. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like the original candle from which all other candles are lit. If one candle is lit, one can light any number of candles, and there is no doubt that each candle is as powerful as the original candle. Nonetheless, one has to recognize the original candle as the original. Similarly, from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a millions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms expand, and each Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remains the original. Thus one who concentrates his mind on Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, immediately attains the perfection of yoga.",

Rather, He admits that it is difficult, but possible by means of constant practice. Constant practice means engaging ourselves in some activities that remind us of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this Society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we therefore have many activities \u2013k\u012brtana,temple activities,pras\u0101da,publications, and so on. Everyone is engaged in some activity with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the center. Therefore whether one is typing for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, cooking for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, chanting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or distributing literature for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is in the yoga system, and he is also in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We engage in activities just as in material life, but these activities are molded in such a way that they are directly connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus through every activity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is possible, and perfection in yoga follows automatically.",

            "\u201cFor one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of success. That is My opinion.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.36)The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it. Similarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time. I may sit down to meditate and focus my mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is very commendable, but there are many yoga societies that teach their students to concentrate on the void or on some color. That is, they do not recommend concentration on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Trying to concentrate the mind on the impersonal or the void is very difficult and troublesome. It is stated by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the twelfth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(12.5),",
            "kle\u015bo \u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101mavyakt\u0101sakta-cetas\u0101mavyakt\u0101 hi gatir du\u1e25kha\u1e41dehavadbhir av\u0101pyate",
            "\u201cFor those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.\u201d",
            "In the temple, the devotee tries to concentrate on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Concentrating on nothingness, on void, is very difficult, and naturally the mind is very flickering. Therefore instead of concentrating on the void, the mind searches out something else. The mind must be engaged in thinking of something, and if it is not thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it must be thinking ofm\u0101y\u0101.Therefore, pseudomeditation on the impersonal void is simply a waste of time. Such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. I may open a class in yogic meditation and charge people money for sitting down and pressing their nose this way and that, but if my students do not attain the real goal of yoga practice, they have wasted their time and money, and I have cheated them.",
            "Therefore one has to concentrate his mind steadily and constantly on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and that is calledsam\u0101dhi.In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the mind is controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious."

            "\u201cArjuna said: O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what is the destination of the unsuccessful transcendentalist, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization with faith but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.37)",
            "The path of self-realization, of mysticism, is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.The basic principle of self-realization is knowing that \u201cI am not this material body but am different from it, and my happiness is in eternal life, bliss, and knowledge.\u201d Before arriving at the point of self-realization, one must take it for granted that he is not this body. That lesson is taught in the very beginning of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:the living entity is not this material body but something different, and his happiness is in eternal life.",
            "Clearly, this life is not eternal. The perfection of yoga means attaining a blissful, eternal life full of knowledge. All yoga systems should be executed with that goal in mind. It is not that one attends yoga classes to reduce fat or to keep the body fit for sense gratification. This is not the goal of yoga, but people are taught this way because they want to be cheated. Actually, if you undergo any exercise program, your body will be kept fit. There are many systems of bodily exercise \u2013 weight lifting and other sports \u2013 and they help keep the body fit, reduce fat, and help the digestive system. Therefore there is no need to practice yoga for these purposes. The real purpose for practicing yoga is to realize that I am not this body. I want eternal happiness, complete knowledge, and eternal life \u2013 that is the ultimate end of the true yoga system.",
            "The goal of yoga is transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by three methods: (1) the path of knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na); (2) the path of the eightfold system; or (3) the path ofbhakti-yoga.In each of these processes, one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the second chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance.",
            "Of these three methods, the path ofbhakti-yogais especially suitable for this age, because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na) and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons. First of all, one may not be actually following the process, the rules and regulations. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. When we accept any process of self-realization, we are actually declaring war againstm\u0101y\u0101,illusion, andm\u0101y\u0101is certain to place many difficulties before us. Therefore, there is a chance of failure, but one has to become very steady. Whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is calledyog\u0101c calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25:deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.",
            "As stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(6.37), quoted above,yog\u0101tmeans \u201cfrom the practice of yoga,\u201dcalitameans \u201cdiversion,\u201d andm\u0101nasa\u1e25means \u201cmind.\u201d So there is every chance for the mind to be diverted from yoga practice. We all have some experience of trying to concentrate by reading a book, and our mind is so disturbed that it does not allow us to concentrate on the book.",
            "Actually, Arjuna is asking a very important question, for one is subject to failure in all types of yoga \u2013 be it the eightfold yoga system, thej\u00f1\u0101na-yogasystem of speculative philosophy, or thebhakti-yogasystem of devotional service. Failure is possible on any of these paths, and the results of failure are clearly explained by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the following dialogue with Arjuna(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.38\u201344).

Consciousness is carried from the body just as the aroma of a flower is carried by the air. When we die, this material body composed of five elements \u2013 earth, water, air, fire, and ether \u2013 decomposes, and the gross materials return to the elements. Or, as the Christian Bible says, \u201cDust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\u201d In some societies the body is burned, in others it is buried, and in others it is thrown to animals. In India, the Hindus burn the body, and thus the body is transformed into ashes. Ash is simply another form of earth. Christians bury the body, and after some time in the grave, the body eventually turns to dust, which again, like ash, is another form of earth. There are other societies \u2013 like the Parsee community in India \u2013 that neither burn nor bury the body but throw it to the vultures, and the vultures immediately come to eat the body, and then the body is eventually transformed into stool. So in any case, this beautiful body, which we are soaping and caring for so nicely, will eventually turn into either stool, ashes, or dust.",
            "At death, the finer elements (mind, intelligence, and ego), which, combined, are called consciousness, carry the small particle of spirit soul to another body to suffer or enjoy, according to one\u2019s work. Our consciousness is molded by our work. If we associate with stool, our consciousness, which is like the air, will carry the aroma of stool, and thus at the time of death will transport us to an undesirable body. Or, if the consciousness passes over roses, it carries the aroma of roses, and thus we are transported to a body wherein we can enjoy the results of our previous work. If we train ourselves to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our consciousness will carry us to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Different types of body are developed according to consciousness; therefore, if we train our consciousness according to the yogic principles, we will attain a body wherein we can practice yoga. We will get good parents and a chance to practice the yoga system, and automatically we will be able to revive the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness practiced in our previous body. Therefore it is stated in this last verse, \u201cBy virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles \u2013 even without seeking them.\u201d Therefore, our present duty is to cultivate divine consciousness. If we want divine life, spiritual elevation, and eternal, blissful life, full of knowledge \u2013 in other words, if we want to go back home, back to Godhead \u2013 we have to train ourselves in divine consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

Through divine association, our consciousness is made divine, and through demoniac association, our consciousness is made demoniac. Therefore, our consciousness must be trained to be divine through the proper association of those in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the duty of one in this human form, a form that gives us a chance to make our next life completely divine. To attain this end, we should try to contact those who are developing divine consciousness.",

In any endeavor, association is very important. For the development of divine consciousness, we have established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, in which the methods of attaining divine consciousness are taught. In this society we invite everyone to come and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This process is not difficult, and even children can participate. No previous qualifications are necessary; one doesn\u2019t need a master\u2019s degree or doctorate.

This is very natural; if we want to enter a particular society, we must meet certain qualifications. If we want to return home, back to Godhead, there is a qualification we must meet \u2013 we must not be materially contaminated. And what is this contamination? Unrestricted sense gratification. If we can free ourselves from the material contamination of sense gratification, we can become eligible to enter the kingdom of God. That process of freeing ourselves, of washing ourselves of this contamination, is called the yoga system. As stated before, yoga does not mean sitting down for fifteen minutes, meditating, and then continuing with sense gratification. To be cured of a certain disease, we must follow the prescriptions of a physician. In this sixth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the process of yoga is recommended, and we have to follow the prescribed methods in order to be freed from material contamination.

Not only is this method direct and immediate, but it is also practical. Although many people entering this Society have no qualifications, they have become highly advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness simply by coming in contact with the Society. In this age, life is very short, and a yoga process that takes a long time will not help the general populace. In Kali-yuga, people are all so unfortunate, and association is very bad. Therefore, this process of directly contacting the Supreme is recommended \u2013hari-n\u0101ma.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in the form of His transcendental name, and we can contact Him immediately by hearing His name.

Because the mind is flickering, dualities will always come. One is always wondering, \u201cShall I become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or should I engage in another consciousness?\u201d These problems are always there, but if one is advanced by virtue of pious activities executed in a previous life, his consciousness will be steadily fixed, and he will resolve, \u201cI will be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d",
            "Whether we acted piously in this life or a previous life really doesn\u2019t matter. This chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so potent that through it we will immediately be purified. We should have the determination, however, not to become implicated in further impious activities. Therefore, for those who want to be initiated in this Society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there are four principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, and no gambling. We don\u2019t say, \u201cNo sex.\u201d But we do say, \u201cNo illicit sex.\u201d If you want sex, get married and have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children. \u201cNo intoxication\u201d means not even taking tea or coffee \u2013 to say nothing of other intoxicants. And there is no gambling and no meat-eating (including fish and eggs). Simply by following these four basic rules and regulations, one becomes immediately uncontaminated. No further endeavor is necessary. As soon as one joins this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and follows these rules and regulations, material contamination is immediately removed, but one must be careful not to be contaminated again. Therefore these rules and regulations should be followed carefully.",
            "Material contamination begins with these four bad habits, and if we manage to check them, there is no question of contamination. Therefore, as soon as we take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we become free. However, we should not think that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness makes us free, we can again indulge in these four bad habits and get free by chanting. That is cheating, and that will not be allowed. Once we are freed, we should not allow ourselves to become contaminated again. One should not think, \u201cI shall drink or have illicit sex and then chant and make myself free.\u201d According to some religious processes, it is said that one can commit all kinds of sin and then go to church, confess to a priest, and be freed of all sin. Therefore people are sinning and confessing and sinning and confessing over and over again. But this is not the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If you are freed, that\u2019s all right, but don\u2019t do it again. After all, what is the purpose of confession? If you confess, \u201cI have committed these sinful activities,\u201d why should you commit them again? If a thief confesses that he has been pickpocketing, he is freed of his sin by virtue of his confession, but does this mean that he should go out again and pick pockets? This requires a little intelligence. One should not think that because by confessing one becomes freed, he should continue to commit sinful activities, confess again, and again become freed. That is not the purpose of confession.",
            "We should therefore understand that if we indulge in unrestricted sinful activities, we become contaminated. We should be careful to have sex only according to the rules and regulations, to eat only food that has been prescribed and properly offered, to defend as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna \u2013 for the right cause. In this way we can avoid contamination and purify our life. If we can continue to live a pure life until the time of death, we will surely be transferred to the kingdom of God. When one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not return to this material world when he gives up his body. This is stated in the fourth chapter.",

Service, however, is different, for in service there is no motive. Service is rendered out of love, just as a mother renders service to her child out of love only. Everyone can neglect that child, but the mother cannot, because love is present.Bhaj-dh\u0101tuis similar in that there is no question of motive, but service is rendered out of pure love.

Give me that.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows better than we do, and He knows our motives. A child does not make demands of his parents, saying, \u201cDear father, give me this. Give me that.\u201d Since the father knows his child\u2019s necessities, there is no need for the child to ask. Similarly, it is not a very good idea to ask God to give us this or that.

The supplies are already there. We should simply try to love God. Even cats and dogs are receiving their necessities without going to church and petitioning God. If a cat or dog receives its necessities without making demands, why should the devotee not receive what he needs? Therefore we should not demand anything from God but should simply try to love Him.

Such a criminal may think, \u201cI\u2019m a very good man,\u201d but because he is violating the laws of the state, he is giving the government trouble, and consequently the government puts him in prison.

It is service without a motive. Generally people pray with some motive in mind, but we should pray only for further engagement in devotional service. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has taught us that when we pray we should not pray for anything material. In the beginning, we cited Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s perfect prayer:",

What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d In this verse, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu addresses the Supreme Lord as Jagad\u012b\u015ba.Jagatmeans \u201cuniverse,\u201d and\u012b\u015bameans \u201ccontroller.\u201d The Supreme Lord is the controller of the universe, and this can be understood by anyone; therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu addresses the Supreme Lord as Jagad\u012b\u015ba instead of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma. In the material world we find many controllers, so it is logical that there is a controller of the entire universe. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu does not pray for wealth, followers, or beautiful women, because these are material requests. Usually, people want to be very great leaders within this material world. Someone tries to become a very rich man like Ford or Rockefeller, or someone else tries to become president or some great leader that many thousands of people will follow. These are all material demands: \u201cGive me money. Give me followers. Give me a nice wife.\u201d Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu refuses to make such materialistic requests. He frankly says, \u201cI don\u2019t want any of these things.\u201d He even says,mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare.That is, He\u2019s not even asking for liberation. Just as the materialists have their demands, the yogis demand liberation. But Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu does not want anything of this nature. Then why is He a devotee? Why is He worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? \u201cI simply want to engage in Your service birth after birth.\u201d He does not even pray for an end to birth, old age, disease, and death. There are no demands whatsoever, for this is the highest platform, the stage ofbhakti-yoga.",
            "Chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also asking the Lord, \u201cPlease engage me in Your service.\u201d This is the mantra taught by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu Himself.Harerefers to the energy of the Lord, andK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aandR\u0101maare names for the Lord Himself. When we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to please engage us in His service. This is because our entire material disease is due to our having forgotten to serve God. In illusion, we are thinking, \u201cI am God. What is the other God I have to serve? I myself am God.\u201d Ultimately, that is the only disease, the last snare of illusion. First of all, a person tries to be prime minister, president, Rockefeller, Ford, this and that, and when one fails or attains such a post and is still unhappy, he wants to become God. That is like becoming an even higher president. When I understand that the presidency does not afford me eternal bliss and knowledge, I demand the highest presidency. I demand to become God. In any case, the demand is there, and this demand is our disease. In illusion, we are demanding to be the highest, but the process ofbhakti-yogais just the opposite. We want to become servants, servants of the servants of the Lord. There is no question of demanding to become the Lord; we just want to serve. That\u2019s all.",
            "Our original nature is rooted in service, and wanting to serve is the crucial test for the devotee. We may not realize it, but in this material world we are also serving. If we want to become president, we have to make so many promises to the voters. In other words, the president has to say, \u201cI\u2019ll give the people my service.\u201d Unless he promises to serve his country, there is no question of his becoming president. So even if one is the most exalted leader, his position is to render service. This is very difficult for people to understand. Despite becoming the highest executive in the land, one has to give service to the people. If that service is not given, one is likely to be usurped, fired, or killed. In the material world, service is very dangerous. If there is a little discrepancy in one\u2019s service, one is immediately fired. When the people did not like the service that President Nixon was rendering, they forced him to resign. Some people disagreed with President Kennedy, and he was killed. Similarly, in India, Gandhi was also killed because some people did not like the way he was rendering service. This is always the position in the material world; therefore one should be intelligent enough to decide to cease rendering service for material motives. We must render service to the Supreme Lord, and that rendering of service is our perfection.",
            "We have formed this International Society for Krishna Consciousness in order to teach people what they have forgotten. In this material world, we have forgotten the service of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore we have become servants ofm\u0101y\u0101,the senses. Therefore, in this Society we are saying, \u201cYou are serving your senses. Now just turn your service to R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and you will be happy. You have to render service \u2013 either tom\u0101y\u0101[illusion], the senses, or to \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "In this world, everyone is serving the senses, but people are not satisfied. No one can be satisfied, because the senses are always demanding more gratification, and this means that we are constantly having to serve the senses. In any case, our position as servant remains the same. It is a question of whether we want to be happy in our service. It is the verdict ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the other Vedic scriptures that we will never be happy trying to serve our senses, for they are only sources of misery. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prays to be situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. He also prays,",

Although a man may be a police officer, when he is at home he is a beloved father to his son.

I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, in accordance with whose will Durg\u0101 conducts herself.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u01015.44) Thus when we pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we pray to Durg\u0101 immediately, because Durg\u0101 is His energy. And when we pray to Durg\u0101, we are actually praying to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because she is working under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Some of thegopas,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends, are eternal associates, and others are promoted to that eternal position. If only the eternal associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can play with Him and others cannot, then what is the meaning of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious? We can also become eternal associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through pious deeds executed in many, many lives. Actually, in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana manifest in this material world, the associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are mainly conditioned living entities who have been promoted to the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus promoted, they are first of all allowed to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the planet where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes are being enacted. After this, they are promoted to the transcendental Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in the spiritual sky.

Christians, however, practicebhakti-yogawhen they worship Jesus Christ, because they are accepting him as the son of God and are therefore accepting God. Unless one accepts God, there is no question ofbhakti-yoga.Christianity, therefore, is also a form of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism, because God is recognized. Nonetheless, there are different stages of God realization. Mainly, Christianity says, \u201cGod is great,\u201d and that is a very good assertion, but the actual greatness of God can be understood fromBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Accepting the greatness of God is the beginning ofbhakti. Bhakti-yogaalso exists among the Muhammadans, because God is the target in the Muslim religion. However, where there is no recognition of a personal God\u2013in other words, where there is only impersonalism\u2013there is no question ofbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yogamust include three items: the servitor, the served, and service. One must be present to accept service, and one must be present to render service. The via media is the process of service itself,bhakti-yoga.Now, if there is no one to accept that service, how isbhakti-yogapossible? Therefore, if a philosophy or religion does not accept God as the Supreme Person, there is no possibility ofbhakti-yogabeing applied.",
            "In thebhakti-yogaprocess, the role of the spiritual master is most important and essential. Although the spiritual master will always come back until his devotees have achieved God realization, one should not try to take advantage of this. We should not trouble our spiritual master but should complete thebhakti-yogaprocess in this life. The disciple should be serious in his service to the spiritual master, and if the devotee is intelligent, he should think, \u201cWhy should I act in such a way that my spiritual master has to take the trouble to reclaim me again? Let me realize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this life.\u201d That is the proper way of thinking. We should not think, \u201cOh, I am sure that my spiritual master will come and save me. Therefore I will do as I please.\u201d If we have any affection for our spiritual master, we should complete the process in this life, so that he does not have to return to reclaim us.",
            "In this regard, there is the example of Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who, in his previous life, was elevated almost toprema-bhakti,the highest platform of devotional service. However, since there is always a chance for a falldown, somehow or other he fell down. In his next life, he was born in a very richbr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, in accordance with the principle enunciated in the sixth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(6.41):\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe.Unfortunately, as is often the case with rich boys, he became a prostitute hunter.

If you were this much attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, how much good you might achieve!\u201d Immediately Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura resumed his devotional service.",
            "Although the spiritual master assumes responsibility for his disciple, we should not take advantage of this. Rather, we should try to please the spiritual master (yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25). We should not put our spiritual master in such a position that he has to reclaim us from a house of prostitution. But even if he has to do so, he will do it, because he assumes this responsibility when he accepts his disciple.",
            "Thebhakti-yogaprocess should be completed in this life, because in this life we have all the instruments necessary to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.

No one has to purchase a tongue. We also have ears with which to hear the sound that the tongue vibrates. Therefore we have all the instruments we need with us \u2013 a tongue and ears. We have only to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and use our ears to hear this vibration, and all perfection will be there. We don\u2019t have to become highly educated scientists or philosophers. We have only to chant and hear.",

There is sufficient water in the oceans, and the sun acts to evaporate this water, turn it into clouds, and drop rain on the land to produce plants. And from the mountains, pure rivers are flowing to supply water throughout the year. If we want to evaporate a few hundred gallons of water, we have to make many arrangements, but the creation is so complete that millions of tons of water are being drawn from the ocean, turned into clouds, and then sprayed all over the land and reserved on the peaks of mountains so that water will be present for the production of grains and vegetables. Thus the creation is complete because it comes from the complete, and similarly our bodies are also complete for spiritual realization. The complete machine is already with us. We have only to utilize it to vibrate the transcendental sound (\u015babda) of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and we will attain complete liberation from all material pangs."

            "Scientists have been trying for many years to reach other planets with spaceships, but this is not the process. Maybe by this means one or two men can reach a planet, but that is not the general process. It is not possible for everyone. Generally, if one wants to transfer himself to a higher planet, he practices thisj\u00f1\u0101na-yogasystem. Not thebhakti-yogasystem. The system ofbhakti-yogais not used for attaining any material planet.",
            "The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are not interested in any planet within this material universe, because they know that on all planets the four basic miseries exist \u2013 birth, old age, disease, and death. In the higher planets, one\u2019s lifespan may be much greater than on this earth, but death is ultimately there. Therefore those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not interested in material life but spiritual life, which means relief from these fourfold miseries. Those who are intelligent do not try to elevate themselves to any planet within this material world. To attain a higher planet, one has to prepare a particular type of body to enable one to live on that planet. We cannot attain these planets by artificial, materialistic means, because a suitable body is necessary to live there. We can stay within water only a short while, but fish are living there their entire lives. But the fish does not have a body suitable for living on the land. Similarly, to enter a higher planet, one has to prepare a suitable body.",
            "In the higher planets, six of our months are equal to one of their days, and the inhabitants of these planets live ten thousand years. This is all described in the Vedic literatures. Although the lifespan on these planets is very long, there is ultimately death. After ten thousand years, twenty thousand years, or millions of years \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 death is ultimately there.",

One who utilizes his intelligence can understand this. One who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not interested in promotion to any planet where death exists; rather, being promoted to the spiritual sky, he receives a body just like God\u2019s.\u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25.God\u2019s body issac-cid-\u0101nanda \u2013eternal, full of knowledge, and full of pleasure.

Why should I be interested in things that are not permanent?\u201d Actually, no one wants an existence that is temporary. If we are living in an apartment and the landlord asks us to vacate, we have to do so, whether we want to leave or not. However, if we move to a better apartment, we are not sorry. It is our nature, however, to want to remain wherever we live. That is because we are permanent and want a permanent residence. Our inclination is to remain. Therefore we don\u2019t want to die. We don\u2019t want the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death. These are external miseries inflicted by material nature, and they attack us like some fever. In order to extricate ourselves, we have to take certain precautions. To get rid of these miseries, it is necessary to get rid of the material body, because these miseries are inherent in material existence.",

This is our constitutional position of eternality, knowledge, and pleasure. If we are alone, if we do not associate with the Supreme Lord, that pleasure is lacking. For want of pleasure, we feel uncomfortable. For want of pleasure, we will accept any kind of association, any kind of pleasure.

It is completely useless to try to understand God by our limited knowledge, and an intelligent man understands this. We should become submissive and try to understand that our position is that of a very insignificant segment in this creation. The wordsnamanta evaindicate that we are just to become submissive in order to understand the Supreme from a reliable source. And what is that source?San-mukharit\u0101m:from the lips of realized souls. Arjuna is understanding God directly from the lips of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and we have to understand God through the lips of Arjuna or his bona fide representative. We can understand the transcendental nature of God only from a reliable source. That source may be Indian, European, American, Japanese, Hindu, Muslim, or whatever. The circumstances are not important. We just have to try to understand by hearing and then try to put the process to practice in our daily lives. By becoming submissive, hearing from the right source, and trying to apply the teachings in our daily lives, we can become conquerors of the Supreme. For one who does this, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes easily available. Ordinarily, God realization is very difficult, but it is very easy for one who submissively hears (\u015bruti-gat\u0101m).",

By the ascending process, one attempts to understand God by his own efforts \u2013 by philosophizing, meditating, or speculating. According to the descending process, one acquires knowledge simply by hearing from an authority, from the bona fide spiritual master and the scriptures.

It is practically impossible for an ordinary man to get an interview with such an important person, to say nothing of having this important person come and stand before him. Yet people are demanding that the Supreme Personality of Godhead come and stand before them. It is our nature to hanker after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is the most attractive, most beautiful, most opulent, most powerful, most learned, and most famous person in the universe. Everyone hankers after these qualities, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all these qualities, and He possesses them in full. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of everything (raso vai sa\u1e25); therefore when we hanker after beauty or power or knowledge or fame, we should just turn our attention to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

            "\u201cAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01018.15)",
            "This material world is certified by its very creator, the Supreme Lord, asdu\u1e25kh\u0101layam,which means \u201cthe place of miseries.\u201d Since this is the case, how can we possibly make it comfortable by so-called scientific advancement?Du\u1e25khameans \u201cmisery\u201d or \u201csuffering,\u201d and real suffering is birth, old age, disease, and death. We have set these problems aside because we cannot solve them; therefore scientists concentrate on atomic bombs and spaceships. Why can\u2019t they solve these important problems that are always causing us to suffer? Obviously, they haven\u2019t the power to do so.",
            "But in this verse, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the solution:m\u0101m upetya punar janma n\u0101pnuvanti.That is, \u201cIf one attains My platform, he does not come back again to this place of misery.\u201d Unfortunately, in the mode of ignorance, people cannot understand that they are in a miserable situation. Animals cannot understand their miserable situations because they haven\u2019t the reason. Man possesses reason whereby he can understand this, but in this age people are using their reasoning power in order to gratify their animal propensities. Reason should be used in getting liberated from this miserable condition. However, if we engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness twenty-four hours a day without deviation, we will go to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not be reborn in this miserable world.Mah\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25:those great souls who have attained the highest perfection, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are forever freed from misery. In this verse, the wordmah\u0101tm\u0101refers to a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man eligible to enter the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The wordmah\u0101tm\u0101does not refer to a political leader like Mahatma Gandhi but to a great soul, a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that themah\u0101tm\u0101enters His abode, He is referring to His transcendental kingdom, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana from which I have come is called Bhauma V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which means it is the same V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana descended on this earth. Just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth through His own internal potency, similarly Hisdh\u0101ma,His abode, also descends. In other words, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends on this earth, He manifests Himself in that particular land, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and therefore that land is also sacred. Apart from this, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has His own abode in the spiritual sky, and this is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "Themah\u0101tm\u0101prepares in this life to enter that transcendental abode. The human form of life can utilize nature to its best interest. Animals cannot. These facilities should be utilized in striving to become amah\u0101tm\u0101and putting an end to birth in this material world, which is characterized by threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are those that pertain to the mind or the body, natural disturbances, and miseries caused by other living entities. Whatever our position in this material world, there is always some kind of misery being inflicted upon us. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a frankly says that it is not possible to avoid misery in this material world, because this world is meant for misery. Unless miseries are present, we cannot come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Misery serves as an impetus to help elevate us to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. An intelligent person understands that although he does not want misery, miseries are being inflicted upon him by force. No one wants misery, but a person should be intelligent enough to question, \u201cWhy are these miseries being forced upon me?\u201d Unfortunately, in modern civilization, people try to set miseries aside, thinking, \u201cOh, why suffer? Let me cover my miseries with some intoxication.\u201d However, the miseries of life cannot be solved by artificial intoxication. As soon as the intoxication is over, one returns to the same point. The miseries of material existence can be solved only by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If we always remain in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we\u2019ll be transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet upon leaving this material body. That is called the highest perfection.",
            "People may inquire, \u201cWell, you say that entering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet constitutes the highest perfection, but we are interested in going to the moon. Is this not a kind of perfection?\u201d Well, the desire to enter the higher planets is always there in the human mind. In fact, another name for the living entity issarva-gata,which means that he wants to travel everywhere. That is the nature of the living entity. Americans who have money often go to India, Europe, or some other country, because they do not like to stagnate in one place. That is our nature, and therefore we are interested in going to the moon or wherever. But according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even if we attain the higher planets, we are still subject to the material miseries.",

            "\u201cFrom the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunt\u012b, never takes birth again.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01018.16)",
            "The universe is divided into fourteen planetary systems (caturda\u015ba-bhuvana) \u2013 seven lower and seven higher. The earth is situated in the middle. In this verse, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25:even if one enters the highest planet, Brahmaloka, there is still birth and death. The wordspunar \u0101vartina\u1e25mean \u201creturning again,\u201d or \u201crepetition of birth and death.\u201d We are changing bodies just as we change clothes, leaving one body and entering another. All planets are filled with living entities. We shouldn\u2019t think that only the earth is inhabited. There are living entities on the higher planets and lower planets as well. From our experience, we can see that no place on earth is vacant of living entities. If we dig into the earth, we find some worms, and if we go into the water we find many aquatics. The air is filled with birds, and if we analyze outer space, we will find many living entities. It is illogical to conclude that there are no living entities on the other planets. To the contrary, they arefullof living entities.",
            "In any case, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that from the highest planet to the lowest planet, there is repetition of birth and death. Yet again, as in the former verse, He says,m\u0101m upetya:\u201cIf you reach My planet, you don\u2019t have to return to this miserable material world.\u201d To stress this point, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a repeats that upon reaching Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His eternal abode, one is liberated from the cycle of birth and death and attains eternal life. It is the duty of human life to understand these problems and attain a blissful, eternal life that is full of knowledge. Unfortunately, people in this age have forgotten the aim of life. Why?Dur\u0101\u015bay\u0101 ye bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25(\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam7.5.31). People have been trapped by the material glitter \u2013 by skyscrapers, big factories, and political activities. People do not stop to consider that however big the skyscraper may be, they will not be allowed to live there indefinitely. We should not spoil our energy, therefore, in building great cities but should employ our energy to elevate ourselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not a religious formula or some spiritual recreation but is the most important factor in our lives.",

The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom, and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and theyugalasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\u0101-yuga vice is introduced, and thisyugalasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and thisyugalasts 564,000 years. And finally, in Kali-yuga (theyugawe have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years), there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion, and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and thisyugalasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of theyuga,the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki-avat\u0101ra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These fouryugasrotating a thousand times comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, the creator god, and the same number comprises one night. Brahm\u0101 lives one hundred of such \u201cyears\u201d and then dies. These \u201chundred years\u201d by earth calculations total 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations, the life of Brahm\u0101 seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity, it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahm\u0101s rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahm\u0101 and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.",
            "In the material universe, not even Brahm\u0101 is free from the process of birth, old age, disease, and death.

So even if we live millions and trillions of years, we have to die. Death cannot be avoided. Throughout the entire universe the process of creation and annihilation is taking place, as described in the next verse:",

We actually belong to that spiritual nature, because we are spirit, but presently we are covered by this material body, and therefore we are a combination of the material and spiritual. Just as we can understand that we are a combination of both natures, we should understand also that there is a spiritual world beyond this material universe. Spiritual nature is called superior, and material nature is called inferior, because without spirit, matter cannot move.",
            "This cannot be understood by experimental knowledge. We may look at millions and millions of stars through telescopes, but we cannot approach what we are seeing. Similarly, our senses are so insufficient that we cannot approach an understanding of the spiritual nature. Being incapable, we should not try to understand God and His kingdom by experimental knowledge. Rather, we have to understand by hearingBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.There is no other way. If we want to know who our father is, we simply have to believe our mother. We have no other way of knowing except by her. Similarly, in order to understand who God is and what His nature is, we have to accept the information given inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.There is no question of experimenting. Once we become advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we will realize God and His nature. We can come to understand, \u201cYes, there is God and a spiritual kingdom, and I have to go there. Indeed, I must prepare myself to go there.\u201d",
            "The wordvyaktameans \u201cmanifest.\u201d This material universe that we are seeing (or partially seeing) before us is manifest. At least at night we can see that stars are twinkling and that there are innumerable planets. But beyond thisvyaktais another nature, calledavyakta,which is unmanifest. That is the spiritual nature, which issan\u0101tana,eternal. This material nature has a beginning and an end, but that spiritual nature has neither beginning nor end. This material sky is within the covering of themahat-tattva,matter. This matter is like a cloud. When there is a storm, it appears that the entire sky is covered with clouds, but actually only an insignificant part of the sky is covered. Because we are very minute, if just a few hundred miles are covered, it appears that the entire sky is covered. As soon as a wind comes and blows the clouds away, we can see the sky once again. Like the clouds, thismahat-tattvacovering has a beginning and an end. Similarly, the material body, being a part of material nature, has a beginning and an end. The body is born, grows, stays for some time, leaves some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Whatever material manifestation we see undergoes these six basic transformations. Whatever exists within material nature will ultimately be vanquished. But herein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is telling us that beyond this vanishing, cloudlike material nature, there is a superior nature, which issan\u0101tana,eternal.Ya\u1e25 sa sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u na\u015byatsu na vina\u015byati.When this material manifestation is annihilated, that spiritual sky remains.

From this Second Canto we understand that there are spiritual airplanes in the spiritual sky, and that the living entities there \u2013 who are all liberated \u2013 travel like lightning on those planes throughout the spiritual sky. This material world is simply an imitation; whatever we see here is simply a shadow of what exists there. The material world is like a cinema, wherein we see but an imitation or a shadow of the real thing that is existing. This material world is only a shadow. As stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.1.1),yatra tri-sargo \u2019m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101:\u201cThis illusory material world is a combination of matter.\u201d In store windows we often see mannequins, but no sane man thinks that these mannequins are real. He can see that they are imitations. Similarly, whatever we see here may be beautiful, just as a mannequin may be beautiful, but it is simply an imitation of the real beauty found in the spiritual world. As \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says,yat satyatay\u0101 mithya-sargo \u2019pi satyavat pratiyate:the spiritual world is real, and this unreal material manifestation only appears to be real. We must understand that reality will never be vanquished and that in essence reality means eternality. Therefore material pleasure, which is temporary, is not actual; real pleasure exists in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Consequently, those who are after the reality don\u2019t participate in this shadow pleasure.",

I am something beyond this body. What is that? That is the spiritual.\u201d In this way, we can feel or sense the presence of spirituality within this matter. We can sense the absence of spirit when a body is dead. If we witness someone dying, we can sense that something is leaving the body.

Impersonalists like the \u015aa\u1e45karites and Buddhists generally speak of the void or emptiness, butBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101does not disappoint us in this way. The philosophy of voidism has simply created atheism, because it is the nature of the living entity to want enjoyment. As soon as he thinks that his future is void, he will try to enjoy the variegatedness of this material life. Thus impersonalism leads to armchair philosophical discussions and attachment to material enjoyment. We may enjoy speculating, but no real spiritual benefit can be derived from such speculation.",

However, when the next election comes, the President will have so many rivals, but in the spiritual sky the Supreme Lord has no rival. Those who want to become rivals are placed in this material world, under the conditions of material nature. In the spiritual sky there is no rivalry, and all the inhabitants therein are liberated souls. From\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe receive information that their bodily features resemble gods. In some of the spiritual planets, God manifests a two-armed form, and in others He manifests a four-armed form. The living entities of those planets have corresponding features, and one cannot distinguish who is God and who is not. This is calleds\u0101r\u016bpya-muktiliberation, wherein one has the same features as the Lord. There are five kinds of liberation:s\u0101yujya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101lokya, s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di,ands\u0101m\u012bpya. S\u0101yujya-muktimeans merging into God\u2019s impersonal effulgence, thebrahma-jyotir.We have discussed this, and have concluded that the attempt to merge and lose individuality is not desirable and is very risky.S\u0101r\u016bpya-muktimeans attaining a body exactly like God\u2019s.S\u0101lokya-muktimeans living on the same planet with God.S\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di-muktimeans having the opulence of God. For instance, God is very powerful, and we can become powerful like Him. That is calleds\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di. S\u0101m\u012bpya-muktimeans always remaining with God as one of His associates. For instance, Arjuna is always with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His friend, and this is calleds\u0101m\u012bpya-mukti.We can attain any one of these five types of liberation, but out of these five,s\u0101yujya-mukti,merging into thebrahma-jyotir,is rejected by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, we worship God as He is and retain our separate identity eternally in order to serve Him. According to the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, impersonalism, one tries to lose his individual identity and merge into the existence of the Supreme. That, however, is a suicidal policy and is not recommended by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "This has also been rejected by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who advocated worship in separation. As stated before, the pure devotee does not even want liberation; he simply asks to remain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotee birth after birth. This is Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s prayer, and the words \u201cbirth after birth\u201d indicate that there is no liberation. This means that the devotee doesn\u2019t care whether he is liberated or not. He simply wants to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to serve the Supreme Lord. Always wanting to engage in God\u2019s transcendental loving service is the symptom of pure devotion. Of course, wherever a devotee is, he remains in the spiritual kingdom, even though in the material body. On his part, he does not demand any of the five types of liberation, nor anything for his personal superiority or comfort. But in order to associate with God in the spiritual planets, one must become His pure devotee.",

Indeed, a person\u2019s horoscope is read not only when he is born but also when he dies, in order to determine what his situation will be in the next life. All this can be determined by astrological calculation. In this verse, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepting those astrological principles, confirming that if one leaves his body at a particular time, he may attain liberation. If one dies at one moment, he may be liberated, or if he dies at another moment, he may have to return to the material world. It is all a question of \u201cchance,\u201d but that chance someway or other is what one has. For the devotee, however, there is no question of chance. Whatever the astrological situation, the devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed liberation. For others, there are chances that if they leave their body at a particular moment, they may attain liberation and enter the spiritual kingdom, or they may be reborn.",

Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna to always remain in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is possible through the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His spiritual kingdom are nondifferent, being absolute, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His sound vibration are the same.

If we are walking down the street chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also going with us. If we walk down the street and look up at the sky, we may see that the sun or the moon is accompanying us.
