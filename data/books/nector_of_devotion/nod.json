            "Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Third Canto, twenty-ninth chapter, verses 12 and 13, \u015ar\u012bla Kapiladeva, while instructing His mother, has given the following characteristics of pure devotional service: \u201cMy dear mother, those who are My pure devotees, and who have no desire for material benefit or philosophical speculation, have their minds so much engaged in My service that they are never interested in asking Me for anything\u00a0\u2013 except to be engaged in that service. They do not even beg to live in My abode with Me.\u201d",
            "There are five kinds of liberation, namely, to become one with the Lord, to live with the Supreme Lord on the same planet, to have the same features as the Lord, to enjoy the same opulences as the Lord and to live as a companion of the Lord. A devotee, what to speak of rejecting material sense gratification, does not even want any of the five kinds of liberation. He is satisfied simply by discharging loving service to the Lord. That is the characteristic of pure devotion.",
            "In the above statement by Kapiladeva from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,the actual position of a pure devotee is described, and the primary characteristics of devotional service are also defined. Further characteristics of devotional service are described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b with evidences from different scriptures. He states that there are six characteristics of pure devotional service, which are as follows:",
            "1.\u2009\u2009Pure devotional service brings immediate relief from all kinds of material distress.",
            "2.\u2009\u2009Pure devotional service is the beginning of all auspiciousness.",
            "3.\u2009\u2009Pure devotional service automatically puts one in transcendental pleasure.",
            "4.\u2009\u2009Pure devotional service is rarely achieved.",
            "5.\u2009\u2009Those in pure devotional service deride even the conception of liberation.",
            "6.\u2009\u2009Pure devotional service is the only means to attract K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-attractive, but pure devotional service attracts even Him. This means that pure devotional service is even transcendentally stronger than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, because it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s internal potency.",
            "RELIEF FROM MATERIAL DISTRESS",
            "InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the Lord says that one should surrender unto Him, giving up all other engagements. The Lord also gives His word there that He will protect surrendered souls from the reactions of all sinful activities. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the distresses from sinful activities are due both to the sins themselves and to sins committed in our past lives. Generally, one commits sinful activities due to ignorance. But ignorance is no excuse for evading the reaction\u00a0\u2013 sinful activities. Sinful activities are of two kinds: those that are mature and those that are not mature. The sinful activities for which we are suffering at the present moment are called mature. The many sinful activities stored within us for which we have not yet suffered are considered immature. For example, a man may have committed criminal acts but not yet been arrested for them. Now, as soon as he is detected, arrest is awaiting him. Similarly, for some of our sinful activities we are awaiting distresses in the future, and for others, which are mature, we are suffering at the present moment.",
            "In this way there is a chain of sinful activities and their concomitant distresses, and the conditioned soul is suffering life after life due to these sins. He is suffering in the present life the results of sinful activities from his past life, and he is meanwhile creating further sufferings for his future life. Mature sinful activities are exhibited if one is suffering from some chronic disease, if one is suffering from some legal implication, if one is born in a low and degraded family or if one is uneducated or very ugly.",
            "There are many results of past sinful activities for which we are suffering at the present moment, and we may be suffering in the future due to our present sinful activities. But all of these reactions to sinful deeds can immediately be stopped if we take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As evidence for this, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b quotes from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Eleventh Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 19. This verse is in connection with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction to Uddhava, where He says, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, devotional service unto Me is just like a blazing fire, which can burn into ashes unlimited fuel supplied to it.\u201d The purport is that as the blazing fire can burn any amount of fuel to ashes, so devotional service to the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can burn up all the fuel of sinful activities. For example, in theG\u012bt\u0101Arjuna thought that fighting was a sinful activity, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a engaged him on the battlefield under His order, and so the fighting became devotional service. Therefore, Arjuna was not subjected to any sinful reaction.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b quotes another verse from the Third Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,thirty-third chapter, verse 6, in which Devah\u016bti addresses her son, Kapiladeva, and says, \u201cMy dear Lord, there are nine different kinds of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting. Anyone who hears about Your pastimes, who chants about Your glories, who offers You obeisances, who thinks of You and, in this way, executes any of the nine kinds of devotional service\u00a0\u2013 even if he is born in a family of dog-eaters [the lowest grade of mankind]\u00a0\u2013 becomes immediately qualified to perform sacrifices.\u201d As such, how is it possible that anyone actually engaged in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has not become purified? It is not possible. One who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service has without doubt become freed from all contaminations of material sinful activities. Devotional service therefore has the power to actually nullify all kinds of reactions to sinful deeds. A devotee is nevertheless always alert not to commit any sinful activities; this is his specific qualification as a devotee. Thus\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamstates that by performing devotional service a person who was born even in a family of dog-eaters may become eligible to take part in the performance of the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in theVedas.It is implicit in this statement that a person born into a family of dog-eaters is generally not fit for performingyaj\u00f1a,or sacrifice. The priestly caste in charge of performing these ritualistic ceremonies recommended in theVedasis called thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aorder. Unless one is abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,he cannot perform these ceremonies.",
            "A person is born in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily or in a family of dog-eaters due to his past activities. If a person is born in a family of dog-eaters it means that his past activities were all sinful. But if even such a person takes to the path of devotional service and begins to chant the holy names of the Lord\u00a0\u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u00a0\u2013 he is at once fit to perform the ritualistic ceremonies. This means that his sinful reactions have immediately become neutralized.",
            "It is stated in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athat there are four kinds of effects due to sinful activities, which are listed as follows: (1) the effect that is not yet fructified, (2) the effect that is lying as seed, (3) the effect that is already mature and (4) the effect that is almost mature. It is also stated that all these four effects become immediately vanquished for those who surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and become engaged in His devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Those effects described as \u201calmost mature\u201d refer to the distress from which one is suffering at present, and the effects \u201clying as seed\u201d are in the core of the heart, where there is a certain stock of sinful desires which are like seeds. The Sanskrit wordk\u016b\u1e6dammeans that they are almost ready to produce the seed, or the effect of the seed. \u201cAn immature effect\u201d refers to the case where the seedling has not begun. From this statement ofPadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is understood that material contamination is very subtle. Its beginning, its fruition and results, and how one suffers such results in the form of distress, are part of a great chain. When one catches some disease, it is often very difficult to ascertain the cause of the disease, where it originated and how it is maturing. The suffering of a disease, however, does not appear all of a sudden. It actually takes time. And as in the medical field, for precaution\u2019s sake, the doctor injects a vaccination to prevent the growing of contamination, the practical injection to stop all the fructifications of the seeds of our sinful activities is simply engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In this connection, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b speaks in the Sixth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,second chapter, verse 17, about the story of Aj\u0101mila, who began life as a fine and dutifulbr\u0101hma\u1e47abut who in his young manhood became wholly corrupted by a prostitute. At the end of his wicked life, just by calling the name \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a],\u201d he was saved despite so much sin. \u015aukadeva points out that austerity, charity and the performance of ritualistic ceremonies for counteracting sinful activities are recommended processes, but that by performing them one cannot remove the sinful desire-seed from the heart, as was the case with Aj\u0101mila in his youth. This sinful desire-seed can be removed only by achieving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And this can be accomplished very easily by chanting themah\u0101-mantra,or Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra,as recommended by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In other words, unless one adopts the path of devotional service, he cannot be one-hundred-percent clean from all the reactions of sinful activities.",
            "By performing Vedic ritualistic activities, by giving money in charity and by undergoing austerity, one can temporarily become free from the reactions of sinful activities, but at the next moment he must again become engaged in sinful activities. For example, a person suffering from venereal disease on account of excessive indulgence in sex life has to undergo some severe pain in medical treatment, and he is then cured for the time being. But because he has not been able to remove the sex desire from his heart, he must again indulge in the same thing and become a victim of the same disease. So medical treatment may give temporary relief from the distress of such venereal disease, but unless one is trained to understand that sex life is abominable, it is impossible to be saved from such repeated distress. Similarly, the ritualistic performances, charity and austerity that are recommended in theVedasmay temporarily stop one from acting in sinful ways, but as long as the heart is not clear, one will have to repeat sinful activities again and again.",
            "Another example given in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamconcerns the elephant who enters into a lake and takes a bath very seriously, cleansing his body thoroughly. Then as soon as he comes onto shore he again takes some dust from the earth and throws it over his body. Similarly, a person who is not trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot become completely free from the desire for sinful activities. Neither theyogaprocess nor philosophical speculations nor fruitive activities can save one from the seeds of sinful desires. Only by being engaged in devotional service can this be done.",
            "There is another evidence in the Fourth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twenty-second chapter, verse 39, wherein Sanat-kum\u0101ra says, \u201cMy dear King, the false ego of a human being is so strong that it keeps him in material existence as if tied up by a strong rope. Only the devotees can cut off the knot of this strong rope very easily by engaging themselves in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others, who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness but who are trying to become great mystics or great ritual performers, cannot advance like the devotees. Therefore, it is the duty of everyone to engage himself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in order to be freed from the tight knot of false ego and engagement in material activities.\u201d",
            "This tight knot of false ego is due to ignorance. As long as one is ignorant about his identity, he is sure to act wrongly and thereby become entangled in material contamination. This ignorance of factual knowledge can also be dissipated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as is confirmed in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aas follows: \u201cPure devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest enlightenment, and when such enlightenment is there, it is just like a blazing forest fire, killing all the inauspicious snakes of desire.\u201d The example is being given in this connection that when there is a forest fire the extensive blazing automatically kills all the snakes in the forest. There are many, many snakes on the ground of the forest, and when a fire takes place, it burns the dried foliage and the snakes are immediately attacked. Animals who have four legs can flee from the fire or can at least try to flee, but the snakes are immediately killed. Similarly, the blazing fire of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so strong that the snakes of ignorance are immediately killed.",
            "K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A CONSCIOUSNESS IS ALL-AUSPICIOUS",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given a definition of auspiciousness. He says that actual auspiciousness means welfare activities for all the people of the world. At the present moment groups of people are engaged in welfare activities in terms of society, community or nation. There is even an attempt in the form of the United Nations for world-help activity. But due to the shortcomings of limited national activities, such a general mass welfare program for the whole world is not practically possible. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, is so nice that it can render the highest benefit to the entire human race. Everyone can be attracted by this movement, and everyone can feel the result. Therefore, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and other learned scholars agree that a broad propaganda program for the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement of devotional service all over the world is the highest humanitarian welfare activity.",
            "How the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement can attract the attention of the whole world and how each and every man can feel pleasure in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is stated in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aas follows: \u201cA person who is engaged in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to be understood to be doing the best service to the whole world and to be pleasing everyone in the world. In addition to human society, he is pleasing even the trees and animals, because they also become attracted by such a movement.\u201d A practical example of this was shown by Lord Caitanya when He was traveling through the forests of Jh\u0101rikha\u1e47\u1e0da in central India for spreading Hissa\u1e45k\u012brtanamovement. The tigers, the elephants, the deer and all the other wild animals joined Him and were participating, in their own ways, by dancing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Furthermore, a person engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, acting in devotional service, can develop all the good qualities that are generally found in the demigods. It is said by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in the Fifth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eighteenth chapter, verse 12, \u201cMy dear King, persons who have unflinching faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and are without any duplicity can develop all the good qualities of the demigods. On account of a devotee\u2019s high grade of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even the demigods like to live with him, and therefore it can be understood that the qualities of the demigods have developed within his body.\u201d",
            "On the other hand, a person who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no good qualities. He may be highly educated from the academic point of view, but in the actual field of his activities he can be seen to be baser than the animals. Even though a person is highly educated academically, if he cannot go beyond the sphere of mental activities then he is sure to perform only material activities and thus remain impure. There are so many persons in the modern world who have been highly educated in the materialistic universities, but it is seen that they cannot take up the movement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and develop the high qualities of the demigods.",
            "For example, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious boy, even if he is not very well educated by the university standard, can immediately give up all illicit sex life, gambling, meat-eating and intoxication, whereas those who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although very highly educated, are often drunkards, meat-eaters, sex mongers and gamblers. These are practical proofs of how a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person becomes highly developed in good qualities, whereas a person who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot do so. We experience that even a young boy in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is unattached to cinemas, nightclubs, naked dance shows, restaurants, liquor shops, etc. He becomes completely freed. He saves his valuable time from being extravagantly spent in the way of smoking, drinking, attending the theater and dancing.",
            "One who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness usually cannot sit silently even for half an hour. Theyogasystem teaches that if you become silent you will realize that you are God. This system may be all right for materialistic persons, but how long will they be able to keep themselves silent? Artificially, they may sit down for so-called meditation, but immediately after their yogic performance they will engage themselves again in such activities as illicit sex life, gambling, meat-eating and many other nonsensical things. But a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person gradually elevates himself without endeavoring for this so-called silent meditation. Simply because he is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he automatically gives up all this nonsense and develops a high character. One develops the highest character by becoming a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conclusion is that no one can truly have any good qualities if he is lacking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "HAPPINESS IN K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A CONSCIOUSNESS",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has analyzed the different sources of happiness. He has divided happiness into three categories, which are (1) happiness derived from material enjoyment, (2) happiness derived by identifying oneself with the Supreme Brahman and (3) happiness derived from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In thetantra-\u015b\u0101straLord \u015aiva speaks to his wife, Sat\u012b, in this way: \u201cMy dear wife, a person who has surrendered himself at the lotus feet of Govinda and who has thus developed pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be very easily awarded all the perfections desired by the impersonalists; and beyond this, he can enjoy the happiness achieved by the pure devotees.\u201d",
            "Happiness derived from pure devotional service is the highest, because it is eternal. The happiness derived from material perfection or understanding oneself to be Brahman is inferior because it is temporary. There is no preventing one\u2019s falling down from material happiness, and there is even every chance of falling down from the spiritual happiness derived by identifying oneself with the impersonal Brahman.",
            "It has been seen that great M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b (impersonalist)sanny\u0101s\u012bs\u00a0\u2013very highly educated and almost realized souls\u00a0\u2013 may sometimes take to political activities or to social welfare activities. The reason is that they actually do not derive any ultimate transcendental happiness in the impersonal understanding and therefore must come down to the material platform and take to such mundane affairs. There are many instances, especially in India, where these M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bsanny\u0101s\u012bsdescend to the material platform again. But a person who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will never return to any sort of material platform. However alluring and attracting they may be, he always knows that no material welfare activities can compare to the spiritual activity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "The mystic perfections achieved by actually successfulyog\u012bsare eight in number.A\u1e47im\u0101-siddhirefers to the power by which one can become so small that he can enter into a stone. Modern scientific improvements also enable us to enter into stone, because they provide for excavating so many subways, penetrating the hills, etc. Soa\u1e47im\u0101-siddhi,the mystic perfection of trying to enter into stone, has also been achieved by material science. Similarly, all of theyoga-siddhis,or perfections, are material arts. For example, in oneyoga-siddhithere is development of the power to become so light that one can float in the air or on water. That is also being performed by modern scientists. They are flying in the air, they are floating on the surface of the water, and they are traveling under the water.",
            "After comparing all these mysticyoga-siddhisto materialistic perfections, we find that the materialistic scientists try for the same perfections. So actually there is no difference between mystic perfection and materialistic perfection. A German scholar once said that the so-calledyogaperfections had already been achieved by the modern scientists, and so he was not concerned with them. He intelligently went to India to learn how he could understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord by means ofbhakti-yoga,devotional service.",
            "Of course, in the categories of mystic perfection there are certain processes that the material scientists have not yet been able to develop. For instance, a mysticyog\u012bcan enter into the sun planet simply by using the rays of the sunshine. This perfection is calledlaghim\u0101.Similarly, ayog\u012bcan touch the moon with his finger. Though the modern astronauts go to the moon with the help of spaceships, they undergo many difficulties, whereas a person with mystic perfection can extend his hand and touch the moon with his finger. Thissiddhiis calledpr\u0101pti,or acquisition. With thispr\u0101pti-siddhi,not only can the perfect mysticyog\u012btouch the moon planet, but he can extend his hand anywhere and take whatever he likes. He may be sitting thousands of miles away from a certain place, and if he likes he can take fruit from a garden there. This ispr\u0101pti-siddhi.",
            "The modern scientists have manufactured nuclear weapons with which they can destroy an insignificant part of this planet, but by theyoga-siddhiknown as\u012b\u015bit\u0101one can create and destroy an entire planet simply at will. Another perfection is calledva\u015bit\u0101,and by this perfection one can bring anyone under his control. This is a kind of hypnotism that is almost irresistible. Sometimes it is found that ayog\u012bwho may have attained a little perfection in thisva\u015bit\u0101mystic power comes out among the people and speaks all sorts of nonsense, controls their minds, exploits them, takes their money and then goes away.",
            "There is another mystic perfection, which is known aspr\u0101k\u0101mya(magic). By thispr\u0101k\u0101myapower one can achieve anything he likes. For example, one can make water enter into his eye and then again come out from within the eye. Simply by his will he can perform such wonderful activities.",
            "The highest perfection of mystic power is calledk\u0101m\u0101vas\u0101yit\u0101.This is also magic, but whereas thepr\u0101k\u0101myapower acts to create wonderful effects within the scope of nature,k\u0101m\u0101vas\u0101yit\u0101permits one to contradict nature\u00a0\u2013 in other words, to do the impossible. Of course, one can derive great amounts of temporary happiness by achieving such yogic materialistic perfections.",
            "Foolishly, people who are enamored of the glimmer of modern materialistic advancement are thinking that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is for less intelligent men. \u201cI am better off being busy with my material comforts\u00a0\u2013 maintaining a nice apartment, family and sex life.\u201d These people do not know that at any moment they can be kicked out of their material situation. Due to ignorance, they do not know that real life is eternal. The temporary comforts of the body are not the goal of life, and it is due only to darkest ignorance that people become enamored of the glimmering advancement of material comforts. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore said that the advancement of material knowledge renders a person more foolish, because it causes one to forget his real identity by its glimmer. This is doom for him, because this human form of life is meant for getting out of material contamination. By the advancement of material knowledge, people are becoming more and more entangled in material existence. They have no hope of being liberated from this catastrophe.",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayait is stated that Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, a great devotee of the Lord, prayed to N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva (the half-lion, half-man incarnation) as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, I repeatedly pray unto Your lotus feet that I may simply be stronger in devotional service. I simply pray that my K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may be more strong and steady, because happiness derived out of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service is so powerful that with it one can have all the other perfections of religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and even the attainment of liberation from material existence.\u201d",
            "Actually, a pure devotee does not aspire after any of these perfections, because the happiness derived from devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so transcendental and so unlimited that no other happiness can compare to it. It is said that even one drop of happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness stands beyond comparison with an ocean of happiness derived from any other activity. Thus, any person who has developed even a little quantity of pure devotional service can very easily kick out all the other kinds of happiness derived from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.",
            "There was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya known as Khol\u0101vec\u0101 \u015ar\u012bdhara, who was a very poor man. He was doing a small business selling cups made from the leaves of plantain trees, and his income was almost nothing. Still, he was spending fifty percent of his small income on the worship of the Ganges, and with the other fifty percent he was somehow living. Lord Caitanya once revealed Himself to this confidential devotee, Khol\u0101vec\u0101 \u015ar\u012bdhara, and offered him any opulence he liked. But \u015ar\u012bdhara informed the Lord that he did not want any material opulence. He was quite happy in his present position and wanted only to gain unflinching faith and devotion unto the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya. That is the position of pure devotees. If they can be engaged twenty-four hours each day in devotional service they do not want anything else, not even the happiness of liberation or of becoming one with the Supreme.",
            "In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trait is also said that any person who has developed even a small amount of devotional service doesn\u2019t care a fig for any kind of happiness derived from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification or the five kinds of liberation. Any kind of happiness derived from religiousness, economic development, liberation or sense gratification cannot even dare to enter into the heart of a pure devotee. It is stated that as the personal attendants and maidservants of a queen follow the queen with all respect and obeisances, similarly the joys of religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and liberation follow the devotional service of the Lord. In other words, a pure devotee does not lack any kind of happiness derived from any source. He does not want anything but service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but even if he should have another desire, the Lord fulfills this without the devotee\u2019s asking.",
            "THE RARENESS OF PURE DEVOTIONAL SERVICE",
            "In the preliminary phase of spiritual life there are different kinds of austerities, penances and similar processes for attaining self-realization. However, even if an executor of these processes is without any material desire, he still cannot achieve devotional service. And aspiring by oneself alone to achieve devotional service is also not very hopeful, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not agree to award devotional service to merely anyone. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can easily offer a person material happiness or even liberation, but He does not agree very easily to award a person engagement in His devotional service. Devotional service can in fact be attained only through the mercy of a pure devotee. In theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta(Madhya19.151) it is said, \u201cBy the mercy of the spiritual master, who is a pure devotee, and by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can achieve the platform of devotional service. There is no other way.\u201d",
            "The rarity of devotional service is also confirmed in thetantra-\u015b\u0101stra,where Lord \u015aiva says to Sat\u012b, \u201cMy dear Sat\u012b, if one is a very fine philosopher, analyzing the different processes of knowledge, he can achieve liberation from the material entanglement. By performance of the ritualistic sacrifices recommended in theVedasone can be elevated to the platform of pious activities and thereby enjoy the material comforts of life to the fullest extent. But all such endeavors can hardly offer anyone devotional service to the Lord, not even if one tries for it by such processes for many, many thousands of births.\u201d",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is also confirmed by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that merely by personal efforts or by the instructions of higher authorities one cannot attain to the stage of devotional service. One must become blessed by the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee, who is completely freed from the contamination of material desires.",
            "In the Fifth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,sixth chapter, verse 18, N\u0101rada also says to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, \u201cMy dear King, it is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as Mukunda, who is the eternal protector of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the Yadus. He is also your spiritual master and instructor in every respect. He is the only worshipable God for you. He is very dear and affectionate, and He is the director of all your activities, both individual and familial. And what\u2019s more, He sometimes carries out your orders as if He were your messenger! My dear King, how very fortunate you are, because for others all these favors given to you by the Supreme Lord would not even be dreamt of.\u201d The purport to this verse is that the Lord easily offers liberation, but He rarely agrees to offer a soul devotional service, because by devotional service the Lord Himself becomes purchased by the devotee.",
            "THE HAPPINESS OF BECOMING ONE WITH THE SUPREME",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that ifbrahm\u0101nanda,or the happiness of becoming one with the Supreme, is multiplied one trillionfold, it still cannot compare to an atomic fraction of the happiness derived from the ocean of devotional service.",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayaPrahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, while satisfying Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva by his prayers, says, \u201cMy dear Lord of the universe, I am feeling transcendental pleasure in Your presence and have become merged in the ocean of happiness. I now consider the happiness ofbrahm\u0101nandato be no more than the water in the impression left by a cow\u2019s hoof in the earth compared to this ocean of bliss.\u201d Similarly, it is confirmed in theBh\u0101v\u0101rtha-d\u012bpik\u0101,\u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s commentary on the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u201cMy dear Lord, some of the fortunate persons who are swimming in the ocean of Your nectar of devotion, and who are relishing the nectar of the narration of Your pastimes, certainly know ecstasies that immediately minimize the value of the happiness derived from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. Such a transcendental devotee regards any kind of happiness other than devotional service as no better than straw in the street.\u201d",
            "ATTRACTING K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated that devotional service attracts even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attracts everyone, but devotional service attracts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The symbol of devotional service in the highest degree is R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called Madana-mohana, which means that He is so attractive that He can defeat the attraction of thousands of Cupids. But R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is still more attractive, for She can even attract K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore devotees call Her Madana-mohana-mohin\u012b\u00a0\u2013 the attractor of the attractor of Cupid.",
            "To perform devotional service means to follow in the footsteps of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, and devotees in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana put themselves under the care of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b in order to achieve perfection in their devotional service. In other words, devotional service is not an activity of the material world; it is directly under the control of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is confirmed that themah\u0101tm\u0101s,or great souls, are under the protection ofdaiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti,the internal energy\u00a0\u2013 R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. So, being directly under the control of the internal potency of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, devotional service attracts even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.",
            "This fact is corroborated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,fourteenth chapter, verse 20, where He says, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, you may know it from Me that the attraction I feel for devotional service rendered by My devotees is not to be attained even by the performance of mysticyoga,philosophical speculation, ritualistic sacrifices, the study ofVed\u0101nta,the practice of severe austerities or the giving of everything in charity. These are, of course, very nice activities, but they are not as attractive to Me as the transcendental loving service rendered by My devotees.\u201d",
            "How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes attracted by the devotional service of His devotees is described by N\u0101rada in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Seventh Canto, tenth chapter, verses 48 and 49. There N\u0101rada addresses King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira while the king is appreciating the glories of the character of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. A devotee always appreciates the activities of other devotees. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was appreciating the qualities of Prahl\u0101da, and that is one symptom of a pure devotee. A pure devotee never thinks himself great; he always thinks that other devotees are greater than himself. The king was thinking, \u201cPrahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is actually a devotee of the Lord, while I am nothing,\u201d and while thinking this he was addressed by N\u0101rada as follows: \u201cMy dear King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, you [the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava brothers] are the only fortunate people in this world. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared on this planet and is presenting Himself to you as an ordinary human being. He is always with you in all circumstances. He is living with you and covering Himself from the eyes of others. Others cannot understand that He is the Supreme Lord, but He is still living with you as your cousin, as your friend and even as your messenger. Therefore you must know that nobody in this world is more fortunate than you.\u201d",
            "InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in His universal form Arjuna prayed, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I thought of You as my cousin-brother, and so I have shown disrespect to You in so many ways, calling You \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019 or \u2018friend.\u2019 But You are so great that I could not understand.\u201d So that was the position of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the greatest among all greats, He remained with those royal brothers, being attracted by their devotion, by their friendship and by their love. That is the proof of how great this process of devotional service is. It can attract even the Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is great, but devotional service is greater than God because it attracts Him. People who are not in devotional service can never understand what great value there is in rendering service to the Lord."

            "CHAPTER TWO",
            "The First Stages of Devotion",
            "The three categories of devotional service which \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes inBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuare listed as devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service in pure love of Godhead. There are many subheadings in each of these categories. Generally it is understood that in the category of devotional service in practice there are two different qualities, devotional service in ecstasy has four qualities, and devotional service in pure love of Godhead has six qualities. These qualities will be explained by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b later on.",
            "In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b suggests that the person eligible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or devotional service, can be classified by his particular taste. He says that devotional service is a continual process from one\u2019s previous life. No one can take to devotional service unless he has had some previous connection with it. For example, suppose in this life I practice devotional service to some extent. Even though it is not one-hundred-percent perfectly performed, whatever I have done will not be lost. In my next life, from the very point where I stop in this life, I shall begin again. In this way there is always a continuity. But even if there is no continuity, if only by chance a person takes interest in a pure devotee\u2019s instruction, he can be accepted and can advance in devotional service. Anyway, for persons who have a natural taste for understanding books likeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,devotional service is easier than for those who are simply accustomed to mental speculation and argumentative processes.",
            "To support this statement there are many authoritative assertions by the learned scholars of bygone ages. According to their general opinion, a person may become governed by certain convictions derived by his own arguments and decisions. Then another person, who may be a greater logician, will nullify these conclusions and establish another thesis. In this way the path of argument will never be safe or conclusive.\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamrecommends, therefore, that one follow in the footsteps of the authorities.",
            "Here is a general description of devotional service given by \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in hisBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.Previously, it has been stated that devotional service can be divided into three categories\u00a0\u2013 namely, devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service in pure love of God. Now \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b proposes to describe devotional service in practice.",
            "Practice means employing our senses in some particular type of work. Therefore devotional service in practice means utilizing our different sensory organs in service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Some of the senses are meant for acquiring knowledge, and some are meant for executing the conclusions of our thinking, feeling and willing. So practice means employing both the mind and the senses in practical devotional service. This practice is not for developing something artificial. For example, a child learns or practices to walk. This walking is not unnatural. The walking capacity is there originally in the child, and simply by a little practice he walks very nicely. Similarly, devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the natural instinct of every living entity. Even uncivilized men like the aborigines offer their respectful obeisances to something wonderful exhibited by nature\u2019s law, and they appreciate that behind some wonderful exhibition or action there is something supreme. So this consciousness, though lying dormant in those who are materially contaminated, is found in every living entity. And, when purified, this is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "There are certain prescribed methods for employing our senses and mind in such a way that our dormant consciousness for loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be invoked, as much as the child, with a little practice, can begin to walk. One who has no basic walking capacity cannot walk by practice. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be aroused simply by practice. Actually there is no such practice. When we wish to develop our innate capacity for devotional service, there are certain processes which, by our accepting and executing them, will cause that dormant capacity to be invoked. Such practice is calleds\u0101dhana-bhakti.",
            "Every living entity under the spell of the material energy is held to be in an abnormal condition of madness. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said, \u201cGenerally, the conditioned soul is mad because he is always engaged in activities that are the causes of bondage and suffering.\u201d The spirit soul in his original condition is joyful, blissful, eternal and full of knowledge. Only by his implication in material activities has he become miserable, temporary and full of ignorance. This is due tovikarma. Vikarmameans \u201cactions which should not be done.\u201d Therefore, we must practices\u0101dhana-bhakti\u00a0\u2013which means to offerma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati(Deity worship) in the morning, to refrain from certain material activities, to offer obeisances to the spiritual master and to follow many other rules and regulations that will be discussed here one after another. These practices will help one become cured of madness. As a man\u2019s mental disease is cured by the directions of a psychiatrist, so thiss\u0101dhana-bhakticures the conditioned soul of his madness under the spell ofm\u0101y\u0101,material illusion.",
            "N\u0101rada Muni mentions thiss\u0101dhana-bhaktiin\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Seventh Canto, first chapter, verse 32. He says there to King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, \u201cMy dear King, one has to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by any means.\u201d That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is the duty of the\u0101c\u0101rya,the spiritual master, to find the ways and means for his disciple to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the beginning ofs\u0101dhana-bhakti.",
            "\u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has given us an authorized program for this purpose, centered around the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.This chanting has so much power that it immediately attaches one to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the beginning ofs\u0101dhana-bhakti.Somehow or other, one has to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The great saint Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although a responsible king, fixed his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and similarly anyone who tries to fix his mind in this way will very rapidly make progress in successfully reviving his original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Now thiss\u0101dhana-bhakti,or practice of devotional service, may also be divided into two parts. The first part is called service according to regulative principles: one has to follow these different regulative principles by the order of the spiritual master or on the strength of authoritative scriptures, and there can be no question of refusal. That is calledvaidh\u012b,or regulated. One has to do it without argument. Another part ofs\u0101dhana-bhaktiis calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101. R\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101refers to the point at which, by following the regulative principles, one becomes a little more attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and executes devotional service out of natural love. For example, a person engaged in devotional service may be ordered to rise early in the morning and offer\u0101rati,which is a form of Deity worship. In the beginning, by the order of his spiritual master, one rises early in the morning and offers\u0101rati,but then he develops real attachment. When he gets this attachment, he automatically tries to decorate the Deity and prepare different kinds of dresses and thinks of different plans to execute his devotional service nicely. Although it is within the category of practice, this offering of loving service is spontaneous. So the practice of devotional service,s\u0101dhana-bhakti,can be divided into two parts\u00a0\u2013 namely, regulative and spontaneous.",
            "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b defines the first part of devotional practice, orvaidh\u012b-bhakti,as follows: \u201cWhen there is no attachment or no spontaneous loving service to the Lord, and one is engaged in the service of the Lord simply out of obedience to the order of the spiritual master or in pursuance of the scriptures, such obligatory service is calledvaidh\u012b-bhakti.\u201d",
            "These principles ofvaidh\u012b-bhaktiare also described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Second Canto, first chapter, verse 5, where \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b instructs the dying Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it as to his course of action. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it met \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b just a week before his death, and the king was perplexed as to what should be done before he was to pass on. Many other sages also arrived there, but no one could give him the proper direction. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, however, gave this direction to him as follows: \u201cMy dear King, if you want to be fearless in meeting your death next week (for actually everyone is afraid at the point of death), then you must immediately begin the process of hearing and chanting and remembering God.\u201d If one can chant and hear Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always remember Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he is sure to become fearless of death, which may come at any moment.",
            "In the statements of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore \u015aukadeva recommends that one should always hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does not recommend that one hear and chant about the demigods. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs (impersonalists) say that one may chant any name, either that of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or those of the demigods, and the result will be the same. But actually this is not a fact. According to the authorized version of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,one has to hear and chant about Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) only.",
            "So \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has recommended to Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that in order to be fearless of death, one has to hear and chant and remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by all means. He also mentions that the Supreme Personality of Godhead issarv\u0101tm\u0101. Sarv\u0101tm\u0101means \u201cthe Supersoul of everyone.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned as\u012b\u015bvara,the supreme controller who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. Therefore, if some way or other we become attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He will make us free from all danger. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is said that anyone who becomes a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished. Others, however, are always vanquished. \u201cVanquished\u201d means that after getting this human form of life, a person does not come out of the entanglement of birth and death and thus misses his golden opportunity. Such a person does not know where he is being thrown by the laws of nature.",
            "Suppose one does not develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this human form of life. He will be thrown into the cycle of birth and death, involving 8,400,000 species of life, and his spiritual identity will remain lost. One does not know whether he is going to be a plant, or a beast, or a bird, or something like that, because there are so many species of life. The recommendation of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b for reviving our original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that somehow or other we should apply our minds to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very seriously and thus also become fearless of death. After death we do not know our destination, because we are completely under the control of the laws of nature. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is controller over the laws of nature. Therefore, if we take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a seriously, there will be no fear of being thrown back into the cycle of so many species of life. A sincere devotee will surely be transferred to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as affirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,also, the same process is advised. There it is said that one should always remember Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is calleddhy\u0101na,or meditation\u00a0\u2013 always remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is said that one has to meditate with his mind fixed upon Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47arecommends that one always fix his mind on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by meditation and not forget Him at any moment. And this state of consciousness is calledsam\u0101dhi,or trance.",
            "We should always try to mold the activities of our lives in such a way that we will constantly remember Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Whether one concentrates his mind on the four-handed form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or on the form of two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is the same. ThePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47arecommends: somehow or other always think of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, without forgetting Him under any circumstances. Actually this is the most basic of all regulative principles. For, when there is an order from a superior about doing something, there is simultaneously a prohibition. When the order is that one should always remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the prohibition is that one should never forget Him. Within this simple order and prohibition, all regulative principles are found complete.",
            "This regulative principle is applicable to allvar\u1e47asand\u0101\u015bramas,the castes and occupations of life. There are fourvar\u1e47as,namely, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as(priests and intellectuals), thek\u1e63atriyas(warriors and statesmen), thevai\u015byas(businessmen and farmers) and the\u015b\u016bdras(laborers and servants). There are also four standard\u0101\u015bramas,namely,brahmacarya(student life),g\u1e5bhastha(householder),v\u0101naprastha(retired) andsanny\u0101sa(renounced). The regulative principles are not only for thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bs(celibate students) to follow, but are applicable for all. It doesn\u2019t matter whether one is a beginner\u00a0\u2013 abrahmac\u0101r\u012b\u00a0\u2013or is very advanced\u00a0\u2013 asanny\u0101s\u012b.The principle of remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly and not forgetting Him at any moment is meant to be followed by everyone without fail.",
            "If this injunction is followed, then all other rules and regulations will automatically fall into line. All other rules and regulations should be treated as assistants or servants to this one basic principle. The injunctions or rules and regulations and their resultant reactions are mentioned in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,fifth chapter, verses 2 and 3. Camasa Muni, one of the nine sages who came to instruct King Nimi, addressed the king and said, \u201cThe four social orders, namely, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,thek\u1e63atriyas,thevai\u015byasand the\u015b\u016bdras,have come out of the different parts of the universal form of the Supreme Lord as follows: thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ashave come out from the head, thek\u1e63atriyashave come out from the arms, thevai\u015byashave come out from the waist, and the\u015b\u016bdrashave come out from the legs. Similarly, thesanny\u0101s\u012bshave come out from the head, thev\u0101naprasthasfrom the arms, theg\u1e5bhasthasfrom the waist and thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bsfrom the legs.\u201d",
            "These different orders of society and grades of spiritual advancement are conceived in terms of qualification. It is confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that the four social orders and the four spiritual orders are created by the Lord Himself in terms of different individual qualities. As the different parts of the body have different types of activities, so the social orders and spiritual orders also have different types of activities in terms of qualification and position. The target of these activities, however, is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u201cHe is the supreme enjoyer.\u201d So, whether one is abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor a\u015b\u016bdra,one has to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one\u2019s activities. This is also confirmed in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamby a verse that reads, \u201cEveryone must be engaged in his particular duty, but the perfection of such work should be tested by how far the Lord is satisfied with such activities.\u201d The injunction herein is that one has to act according to his position, and by such activities one must either satisfy the Supreme Personality or else fall down from one\u2019s position.",
            "For example, abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,who is born out of the head of the Lord, has as his business to preach the transcendental Vedic sounds, or\u015babda-brahma.Because thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ais the head, he has to preach the transcendental sound, and he also has to eat on behalf of the Supreme Lord. According to Vedic injunctions, when abr\u0101hma\u1e47aeats it is to be understood that the Personality of Godhead is eating through him. It is not, however, that thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ashould simply eat on behalf of the Lord and not preach the message ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to the world. Actually, one who preaches the message of theG\u012bt\u0101is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is confirmed in theG\u012bt\u0101itself. Such a preacher is factually abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,and thus by feeding him one feeds the Supreme Lord directly.",
            "Similarly, thek\u1e63atriyahas to protect people from the onslaughts ofm\u0101y\u0101.That is his duty. For example, as soon as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it saw that a black man was attempting to kill a cow, he immediately took his sword, wanting to kill the black man, whose name was Kali.* That is ak\u1e63atriya\u2019sduty. Violence is required in order to give protection. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly gave His order to Arjuna to commit violence on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, just to give protection to the people in general.",
            "*\u00a0Not to be confused with K\u0101l\u012b, the demigoddess who is the devastating feature of material nature.",
            "Thevai\u015byasare meant for producing agricultural products, trading them and distributing them. And the working class, or\u015b\u016bdras,are those who haven\u2019t the intelligence of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asor thek\u1e63atriyasor thevai\u015byas,and therefore they are meant to help these higher classes by bodily labor. In this way, there is full cooperation and spiritual advancement among all the different orders of society. And when there is no such cooperation, the members of society will fall down. That is the present position in the Kali-yuga, this age of quarrel. Nobody is doing his duty, and everyone is simply puffed up by calling himself abr\u0101hma\u1e47a(intellectual) or ak\u1e63atriya(soldier or statesman). But actually such people are without status. They are out of touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is intended to set the whole of human society in proper condition so that everyone will be happy and take profit from developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed Uddhava that by following the injunctions of the social and spiritual orders of human society, one can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as a result of such satisfaction the whole society gets all the necessities of life amply and without difficulty. This is because, after all, the Supreme Personality of Godhead maintains all other living entities. If the whole society performs its respective duties and remains in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no doubt that all of its members will live very peacefully and happily. Without wanting the necessities of life, the whole world will be turned into Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, a spiritual abode. Even without being transferred to the kingdom of God, by following the injunctions of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamand prosecuting the duties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all human society will be happy in all respects.",
            "There is a similar statement by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself to Uddhava, in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twenty-seventh chapter, verse 49. The Lord says there, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, all persons are engaged in activities, whether those indicated in the revealed scriptures or ordinary worldly activities. If by the result of either of such activities they worship Me in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then automatically they become very happy within this world as well as in the next. Of this there is no doubt.\u201d We can conclude from this statement by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will give everyone all perfection in all desires.",
            "Thus the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is so nice that there is no need of even designating oneselfbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprasthaorsanny\u0101s\u012b.Let everyone be engaged in whatever occupation he now has. Simply let him worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the result of his activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will adjust the whole situation, and everyone will be happy and peaceful within this world. In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trathe regulative principles of devotional service are described as follows: \u201cAny activities sanctioned in the revealed scriptures and aiming at the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are accepted by saintly teachers as the regulative principles of devotional service. If one regularly executes such service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, then gradually he rises to the platform of serving in pure love of God.\u201d"

            "Eligibility of the Candidate for Accepting Devotional Service",
            "On account of his association withmah\u0101tm\u0101s,or great souls one hundred percent engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, one may attain a little bit of attraction for \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But at the same time one may remain very much attached to fruitive activities and material sense enjoyment and not be prepared to undergo the different types of renunciation. Such a person, if he has unflinching attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes an eligible candidate for discharging devotional service.",
            "This attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in association with pure devotees is the sign of great fortune. It is confirmed by Lord Caitanya that only the fortunate persons, by the mercy of both a bona fide spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, will get the seed of devotional service. In this connection, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Eleventh Canto, twentieth chapter, verse 8, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, only by exceptional fortune does someone become attracted to Me. And even if one is not completely detached from fruitive activities, or is not completely attached to devotional service, such service is quickly effective.\u201d",
            "Devotees may be divided into three classes. The devotee in the first or uppermost class is described as follows: he is very expert in the study of relevant scriptures, and he is also expert in putting forward arguments in terms of those scriptures. He can very nicely present conclusions with perfect discretion and can consider the ways of devotional service in a decisive way. He understands perfectly that the ultimate goal of life is to attain to the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only object of worship and love. This first-class devotee is one who has strictly followed the rules and regulations under the training of a bona fide spiritual master and has sincerely obeyed him in accord with revealed scriptures. Thus, being fully trained to preach and become a spiritual master himself, he is considered first class. The first-class devotee never deviates from the principles of higher authority, and he attains firm faith in the scriptures by understanding with all reason and arguments. When we speak of arguments and reason, it means arguments and reason on the basis of revealed scriptures. The first-class devotee is not interested in dry speculative methods meant for wasting time. In other words, one who has attained a mature determination in the matter of devotional service can be accepted as the first-class devotee.",
            "The second-class devotee has been defined by the following symptoms: he is not very expert in arguing on the strength of revealed scripture, but he has firm faith in the objective. The purport of this description is that the second-class devotee has firm faith in the procedure of devotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he may sometimes fail to offer arguments and decisions on the strength of revealed scripture to an opposing party. But at the same time he is still undaunted within himself as to his decision that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme object of worship.",
            "The neophyte, or third-class devotee, is one whose faith is not strong and who, at the same time, does not recognize the decision of the revealed scripture. The neophyte\u2019s faith can be changed by someone with strong arguments or by an opposite decision. Unlike the second-class devotee, who also cannot put forward arguments and evidences from the scripture but who still has all faith in the objective, the neophyte has no firm faith in the objective. Thus he is called the neophyte devotee.",
            "Further classification of the neophyte devotee is made in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.It is stated there that four classes of men\u00a0\u2013 namely, those who are distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are inquisitive and those who are wise\u00a0\u2013 begin devotional service and come to the Lord for relief in the matter of their respective self-satisfaction. They go into some place of worship and pray to God for mitigation of material distress or for some economic development or to satisfy their inquisitiveness. And a wise man who simply realizes the greatness of God is also counted among the neophytes. Such beginners can be elevated to the second-class or first-class platform if they associate with pure devotees.",
            "An example of the neophyte class is Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva. He was in need of his father\u2019s kingdom and therefore engaged himself in devotional service to the Lord. Then in the end, when he was completely purified, he declined to accept any material benediction from the Lord. Similarly, Gajendra was distressed and prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for protection, after which he became a pure devotee. Similarly Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sananda and Sanat-kum\u0101ra were all in the category of wise, saintly persons, and they were also attracted by devotional service. A similar thing happened to the assembly in the Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya forest headed by the sage \u015aaunaka. The sages were inquisitive and were always asking S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus they achieved the association of a pure devotee and became pure devotees themselves. So that is the way of elevating oneself. In whatever condition one may be, if he is fortunate enough to associate with pure devotees, then very quickly he is elevated to the second-class or first-class platform.",
            "These four types of devotees have been described in the seventh chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,and they have all been accepted as pious. Without becoming pious, no one can come to devotional service. It is explained inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that only one who has continually executed pious activities and whose sinful reactions in life have completely stopped can take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others cannot. The neophyte devotees are classified into four groups\u00a0\u2013 the distressed, those in need of money, the inquisitive and the wise\u00a0\u2013 according to the gradations of their pious activities. Without pious activities, if a man is in a distressed condition he becomes an agnostic, a communist or something like that. Because he does not firmly believe in God, he thinks that he can adjust his distressed condition by totally disbelieving in Him.",
            "Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, has explained in theG\u012bt\u0101that out of these four types of neophytes, the one who is wise is very dear to Him, because a wise man, if he is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not seeking an exchange of material benefits. A wise man who becomes attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not want any return from Him either in the form of His relieving his distress or in gaining money. This means that from the very beginning his basic principle of attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is, more or less, love. Furthermore, due to his wisdom and study of\u015b\u0101stras(scriptures), he can also understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "It is confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that after many, many births, when one becomes actually wise, he surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, knowing perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (V\u0101sudeva) is the origin and cause of all causes. Therefore, he sticks to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and gradually develops love for Him. Although such a wise man is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the others are also accepted as very magnanimous, because even though they are distressed or in need of money, they have come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for satisfaction. Thus they are accepted as liberal, broad-mindedmah\u0101tm\u0101s.",
            "Without being elevated to the position of aj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b,or wise man, one cannot stick to the principle of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The less intelligent or those whose intelligence has been taken away by the spell ofm\u0101y\u0101are attached to different demigods on account of the influence of the modes of nature. The wise man is he who has thoroughly understood that he is spirit soul and not simply a body. Because he realizes that he is spirit and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme spirit, he knows that his intimate relationship should be with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not with this body. The distressed and the man in want of money are in the material concept of life, because distress and need of money are both in relationship with this body. One who is inquisitive may be a little above the distressed and the man in need of money, but still he is on the material platform. But a wise man who seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows perfectly well that he is spirit soul, or Brahman, and that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme spirit soul, or Para-brahman. He knows that the spirit soul, being subordinate and finite, should always dovetail himself with the infinite and supreme soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the relationship of the wise man with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "It can be concluded that a person who is freed from the bodily concept of life is an eligible candidate for pure devotional service. It is also confirmed in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that after Brahman realization, when one is freed from material anxieties and can see every living entity on an equal level, he is eligible to enter into devotional service.",
            "As stated before, there are three kinds of happiness\u00a0\u2013 material, spiritual and devotional. Devotional service and the happiness due to its execution are not possible as long as one is materially affected. If someone has a desire for material enjoyment or for becoming one with the Supreme, these are both considered material concepts. Because the impersonalists cannot appreciate the spiritual happiness of association and the exchange of loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, their ultimate goal is to become one with the Lord. This concept is simply an extension of the material idea. In the material world, everyone is trying to be the topmost head man among all his fellow men or neighbors. Either communally, socially or nationally, everyone is competing to be greater than all others, in the material concept of life. This greatness can be extended to the unlimited, so that one actually wants to become one with the greatest of all, the Supreme Lord. This is also a material concept, although maybe a little more advanced.",
            "However, the perfect spiritual concept of life is complete knowledge of one\u2019s constitutional position, in which one knows enough to dovetail himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. One must know that he is finite and that the Lord is infinite. Thus it is not possible to actually become one with the Lord even if one aspires for this. It is simply not possible. Therefore, anyone who has any desire or aspiration for satisfying his senses by becoming more and more important, either in the material sense or in the spiritual sense, cannot actually relish the really sweet taste of devotional service. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has therefore compared possessing thesebhukti(material) andmukti(liberation) desires with being influenced by the black art of a witch: in both cases one is in trouble.Bhuktimeans material enjoyment, andmuktimeans to become freed from material anxiety and to become one with the Lord. These desires are compared to being haunted by ghosts and witches, because while these aspirations for material enjoyment or spiritual oneness with the Supreme remain, no one can relish the actual transcendental taste of devotional service.",
            "A pure devotee never cares for liberation. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear son of Nanda, I do not want any material happiness in the shape of many followers, nor immense opulence in wealth, nor any beautiful wife, nor do I want cessation from material existence. I may take many births one after another, but what I pray from You is that my devotion unto You may always remain unflinching.\u201d",
            "The attention of a pure devotee is so much attracted to glorification of the Lord\u2019s pastimes, name, qualities, forms, etc., that the devotee does not care formukti.\u015ar\u012b Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said, \u201cIf I am engaged in devotional service unto You, my dear Lord, then very easily can I perceive Your presence everywhere. And as far as liberation is concerned, I think liberation stands at my door with folded hands, waiting to serve me.\u201d To pure devotees, therefore, liberation and spiritual emancipation are not very important things.",
            "In this connection, in the Third Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,chapter twenty-five, verse 36, Kapiladeva has advised His mother, Devah\u016bti, as follows: \u201cMy dear mother, My pure devotees are charmed by seeing My different forms, the beauty of My face, the structure of My body so enchanting. My laughing, My pastimes and My glance appear to them so beautiful that their minds are always absorbed in thoughts of Me and their lives are dedicated fully unto Me. Although such people do not desire any kind of liberation or any kind of material happiness, still I give them a place among My associates in the supreme abode.\u201d",
            "This evidence from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamgives assurance to the pure devotee of being elevated to association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b remarks in this connection that one who is actually attracted by the beauty of the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His service, and whose heart, by such attraction, is always full with transcendental bliss, will naturally never aspire after the liberation which is so valuable to the impersonalists.",
            "A similar passage is also there in the Third Canto, fourth chapter, verse 15 of the same book, wherein Uddhava addresses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and says, \u201cMy dear Lord, for persons who are engaged in Your transcendental loving service there is nothing worth obtaining from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification or liberation\u00a0\u2013 although happiness from these different sources can be very easily had by them. In spite of such facilities, my dear Lord, I do not aspire to achieve any such results. My only prayer is that I may have unflinching faith and devotion unto Your lotus feet.\u201d",
            "A similar passage appears in the Third Canto, twenty-fifth chapter, verse 34 wherein Kapiladeva instructs His mother and says, \u201cMy dear mother, devotees whose hearts are always filled in the service of My lotus feet and who are prepared to do anything for My satisfaction, especially those fortunate devotees who assemble together to understand My qualities, pastimes and form and thus glorify Me congregationally and derive transcendental pleasure therefrom, never desire to become one with Me. And what to speak of becoming one with Me, if they are offered a post like Mine in My abode, or opulence like Mine, or even personal association with Me with similar bodily features, they refuse to accept, because they are satisfied simply by being engaged in My devotional service.\u201d",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Fourth Canto, ninth chapter, verse 10, King Dhruva says, \u201cMy dear Lord, the transcendental pleasure derived by meditation upon Your lotus feet, which is enjoyed by the pure devotees, cannot be approached by the transcendental pleasure derived by the impersonalists through self-realization. So how can the fruitive workers, who at most can aspire to promotion to the higher heavenly planets, understand You, and how can they be described as enjoying a happiness similar to the devotees\u2019 happiness?\u201d"

            "Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation",
            "How much a devotee is seriously attached to the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the statement of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu (\u0100di-r\u0101ja), which is described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Fourth Canto, twentieth chapter, verse 24. He prays to the Supreme Personality of Godhead thus: \u201cMy dear Lord, if after taking liberation I have no chance of hearing the glories of Your Lordship, glories chanted by pure devotees from the core of their hearts in praise of Your lotus feet, and if I have no chance for this honey of transcendental bliss, then I shall never ask for liberation or this so-called spiritual emancipation. I shall simply always pray unto Your Lordship that You may give me millions of tongues and millions of ears, so that I can constantly chant and hear of Your transcendental glories.\u201d",
            "The impersonalists desire to merge into the existence of the Supreme, but without keeping their individuality they have no chance of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord. Because they have no idea of the transcendental form of the Supreme Lord, there is no chance of their chanting and hearing of His transcendental activities. In other words, unless one is already beyond liberation, one cannot relish the transcendental glories of the Lord, nor can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord.",
            "A similar statement is found in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Fifth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 44. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b addresses Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja there and says, \u201cThe great soul King Bharata was so much attached to the service of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he very easily gave up his lordship over the earthly planet and his affection for his children, society, friends, royal opulence and beautiful wife. He was so very lucky that the goddess of fortune was pleased to offer him all kinds of material concessions, but he never accepted any of these material opulences.\u201d \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b praises this behavior of King Bharata very highly. He says, \u201cAny person whose heart is attracted by the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Madhus\u016bdana, does not care even for that liberation which is aspired to by many great sages, what to speak of material opulences.\u201d",
            "In theBh\u0101gavatam,Sixth Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 25, there is a similar statement by V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, who addresses the Lord as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, by leaving Your transcendental service I may be promoted to the planet called Dhruvaloka [the polestar], or I may gain lordship over all the planetary systems of the universe. But I do not aspire to this. Nor do I wish the mystic perfections ofyogapractice, nor do I aspire to spiritual emancipation. All I wish for, my Lord, is Your association and transcendental service eternally.\u201d",
            "This statement is confirmed by Lord \u015aiva in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Sixth Canto, seventeenth chapter, verse 28, wherein Lord \u015aiva addresses Sat\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear Sat\u012b, persons who are devoted to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] are not afraid of anything. If they are elevated to the higher planetary systems, or if they get liberation from material contamination, or if they are pushed down to the hellish condition of life\u00a0\u2013 or, in fact, in any situation whatever\u00a0\u2013 they are not afraid of anything. Simply because they have taken shelter of the lotus feet of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, for them any position in the material world is as good as another.\u201d",
            "There is a similar statement by Indra, the king of heaven, in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Sixth Canto, eighteenth chapter, verse 74. There Indra addresses mother Diti in this manner: \u201cMy dear mother, persons who have given up all kinds of desire and are simply engaged in devotional service to the Lord know what is actually their self-interest. Such persons are actually serving their self-interests and are considered first-class experts in the matter of advancing to the perfectional stage of life.\u201d",
            "In the Seventh Canto of theBh\u0101gavatam,sixth chapter, verse 25, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da says, \u201cMy dear friends born into atheistic families, if you can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then there is nothing more rare in this world. In other words, if the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is pleased with you, then any desire you may have within the core of your heart can be fulfilled without any doubt. As such, what is the use of elevating yourself by the results of fruitive activities, which are automatically achieved in all events by the modes of material nature? And what is the use for you of spiritual emancipation or liberation from material bondage? If you are always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord and always relishing the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord, then there is no necessity for any of these.\u201d By this statement of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja it is clearly understood that one who takes pleasure in chanting and hearing the transcendental glories of the Lord has already surpassed all kinds of material benedictions, including the results of pious fruitive activities, sacrifices and even liberation from material bondage.",
            "Similarly, in the same Seventh Canto, eighth chapter, verse 42, when the demigods are offering prayers to Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Indra the king of heaven says, \u201cO supreme one, these demons talk of our share of participation in the performances of ritualistic sacrifices, but simply by Your appearance as Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva You have saved us from terrible fears. Actually, our shares in the sacrificial performances are due to You only, because You are the supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices. You are the Supersoul of every living entity, and therefore You are the actual owner of everything. Long were our hearts always filled with fear of this demon, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. But You are so kind toward us that by killing him You have removed that fear from within our hearts and have given us the chance to place Your Lordship within our hearts again. For persons who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Your Lordship, all the opulences which were taken away from us by the demons are counted as nothing. Devotees do not care even for liberation, what to speak of these material opulences. Actually, we are not enjoyers of the fruits of sacrifices. Our only duty is to always be engaged in Your service, for You are the enjoyer of everything.\u201d",
            "The purport of this statement by Indra is that beginning from Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant, no living entities are meant for enjoying the material opulences. They are simply meant for offering everything to the supreme proprietor, the Personality of Godhead. By doing so, they automatically enjoy the benefit. The example can be cited again of the different parts of the body collecting foodstuffs and cooking them so that ultimately a meal may be offered to the stomach. After it has gone to the stomach, all the parts of the body equally enjoy the benefit of the meal. So, similarly, everyone\u2019s duty is to satisfy the Supreme Lord, and then automatically everyone will become satisfied.",
            "A similar verse is found in the Eighth Canto, third chapter of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,verse 20. Gajendra says there, \u201cMy dear Lord, I have no experience of the transcendental bliss derived from Your devotional service, so therefore I have asked from You some favor. But I know that persons who are pure devotees and have, by serving the lotus feet of great souls, become freed from all material desires are always merged in the ocean of transcendental bliss and, as such, are always satisfied simply by glorifying Your auspicious characteristics. For them there is nothing else to aspire to or pray for.\u201d",
            "In the Ninth Canto of theBh\u0101gavatam,fourth chapter, verse 67, the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha replies to Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni thus: \u201cMy pure devotees are always satisfied being engaged in devotional service, and therefore they do not aspire even after the five liberated stages, which are (1) to be one with Me, (2) to achieve residence on My planet, (3) to have My opulences, (4) to possess bodily features similar to Mine and (5) to gain personal association with Me. So when they are not interested even in these liberated positions, you can know how little they care for material opulences or material liberation.\u201d",
            "There is a similar prayer by then\u0101ga-patn\u012bs(wives of the K\u0101liya serpent), in the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,sixteenth chapter, verse 37. Then\u0101ga-patn\u012bssay there, \u201cDear Lord, the dust of Your lotus feet is very wonderful. Any person who is fortunate enough to achieve this dust does not care for heavenly planets, lordship over all the planetary systems, the mystic perfections ofyogaor even liberation from material existence. In other words, anyone who adores the dust of Your lotus feet does not care a fig for all other perfectional stages.\u201d",
            "There is a similar statement in the Tenth Canto, eighty-seventh chapter, verse 21, wherein the \u015arutis, theVedaspersonified, pray to the Lord as follows: \u201cDear Lord, it is very difficult to understand spiritual knowledge. Your appearance here, just as You are, is to explain to us this most difficult subject of knowledge of the spirit. As such, Your devotees who have left their domestic comforts to associate with the liberated\u0101c\u0101ryas[teachers] are now fully merged in the devotional service of Your Lordship, and thus they do not care for any so-called liberation.\u201d",
            "In explaining this verse it should be noted that spiritual knowledge means understanding the self and the Supersoul, or Superself. The individual soul and the Supersoul are qualitatively one, and therefore both of them are known as Brahman, or spirit. But knowledge of Brahman is very difficult to understand. There are so many philosophers engaged in the matter of understanding the soul, but they are unable to make any tangible advancement. It is confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that out of many millions of persons, only one may try to understand what is spiritual knowledge, and out of many such persons who are trying to understand, only one or a few may know what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So this verse says that spiritual knowledge is very difficult to achieve, and so in order to make it more easily attainable, the Supreme Lord Himself comes in His original form as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and gives His instruction directly to an associate like Arjuna, just so that the people in general may take advantage of this spiritual knowledge. This verse also explains that liberation means having completely given up all the material comforts of life. Those who are impersonalists are satisfied by simply being liberated from the material circumstances, but those who are devotees can automatically give up material life and also enjoy the transcendental bliss of hearing and chanting the wonderful activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twentieth chapter, verse 34, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Uddhava, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, the devotees who have completely taken shelter of My service are so steadfast in devotional service that they have no other desire. Even if they are offered the four kinds of spiritual opulences* they will refuse to accept them. So what to speak of their desiring anything within the material world!\u201d Similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in another passage of theBh\u0101gavatam,Eleventh Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 14, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, a person whose consciousness is completely absorbed in My thought and activities does not aspire even to occupy the post of Brahm\u0101, or the post of Indra, or the post of lordship over the planets, or the eight kinds of mystic perfections, or even liberation itself.\u201d In the Twelfth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,tenth chapter, verse 6, Lord \u015aiva says to Dev\u012b, \u201cMy dear Dev\u012b, this greatbr\u0101hma\u1e47asage M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya has attained unflinching faith and devotion unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such he does not aspire after any benedictions, including liberation from the material world.\u201d",
            "*\u00a0The fifth kind of liberation, merging with the Supreme, is not considered an opulence in spiritual variegated existence.",
            "Similarly, there is a statement inPadma Pur\u0101\u1e47adescribing the ritualistic function during the month of K\u0101rttika (October-November). During this month, in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana it is the regulative principle to pray daily to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His D\u0101modara form. The D\u0101modara form refers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His childhood when He was tied up with rope by His mother, Ya\u015bod\u0101.D\u0101mameans \u201cropes,\u201d andudarameans \u201cthe abdomen.\u201d So mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, being disturbed by naughty K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, bound Him round the abdomen with a rope. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is named D\u0101modara. During K\u0101rttika, D\u0101modara is prayed to as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, You are the Lord of all, the giver of all benedictions.\u201d There are many demigods, like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who sometimes offer benedictions to their respective devotees. For example, R\u0101va\u1e47a was blessed with many benedictions by Lord \u015aiva, and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was blessed by Lord Brahm\u0101. But even Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 depend upon the benedictions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as the Lord of all benefactors. As such, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can offer His devotees anything they want, but still, the devotee\u2019s prayer continues, \u201cI do not ask You for liberation or any material facility up to the point of liberation. What I want as Your favor is that I may always think of Your form in which I see You now, as D\u0101modara. You are so beautiful and attractive that my mind does not want anything besides this wonderful form.\u201d In this same prayer there is another passage in which it is said, \u201cMy dear Lord D\u0101modara, once when You were playing as a naughty boy in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, You broke the box containing yogurt, and because of that, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 considered You an offender and tied You with rope to the household grinding mortar. At that time You delivered the two sons of Kuvera, Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva, who were staying there as twoarjunatrees in the yard of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. My only request is that by Your merciful pastimes You may similarly deliver me.\u201d",
            "The story behind this verse is that the two sons of Kuvera (the treasurer of the demigods) were puffed up on account of the opulence of their father, and so once on a heavenly planet they were enjoying themselves in a lake with some naked damsels of heaven. At that time the great saint N\u0101rada Muni was passing on the road and was sorry to see the behavior of the sons of Kuvera. Seeing N\u0101rada passing by, the damsels of heaven covered their bodies with cloth, but the two sons, being drunkards, did not have this decency. N\u0101rada became angry with their behavior and cursed them thus: \u201cYou have no sense, so it is better if you become trees instead of the sons of Kuvera.\u201d Upon hearing this, the boys came to their senses and begged N\u0101rada to be pardoned for their offenses. N\u0101rada then said, \u201cYes, you shall become trees,arjunatrees, and you will stand in the courtyard of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself will appear in time as the foster son of Nanda, and He will deliver you.\u201d In other words, the curse of N\u0101rada was a benediction to the sons of Kuvera because indirectly it was foretold that they would be able to receive the favor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. After that, Kuvera\u2019s two sons stood as two bigarjunatrees in the courtyard of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja until Lord D\u0101modara, in order to fulfill the desire of N\u0101rada, dragged the grinding mortar to which He was tied and struck the two trees, violently causing them to fall down. From out of these fallen trees came Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva, who had by then become great devotees of the Lord.",
            "There is a passage in theHaya\u015b\u012br\u1e63a Pa\u00f1car\u0101trathat states, \u201cMy dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, I do not want any resultant benediction from my religious life, nor do I want any economic development, nor do I want to enjoy sense gratification nor liberation. I simply pray to be an eternal servant at Your lotus feet. Kindly oblige me and give me this benediction.\u201d",
            "In the sameHaya\u015b\u012br\u1e63a Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra,after N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva wanted to give benedictions to Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Prahl\u0101da did not accept any material benediction and simply asked the favor of the Lord to remain His eternal devotee. In this connection, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja cited the example of Hanum\u0101n, the eternal servitor of Lord R\u0101macandra, who also set an example by never asking any material favor from the Lord. He always remained engaged in the Lord\u2019s service. That is the ideal character of Hanum\u0101n, for which he is still worshiped by all devotees. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja also offered his respectful obeisances unto Hanum\u0101n. There is a well-known verse spoken by Hanum\u0101n in which he says, \u201cMy dear Lord, if You like You can give me salvation from this material existence, or the privilege of merging into Your existence, but I do not wish any of these things. I do not want anything that diminishes my relationship with You as servant to master, even after liberation.\u201d",
            "In a similar passage in theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trait is stated, \u201cMy dear Lord, I do not wish any perfectional stage by performing the ritualistic religious ceremonies or by economic development or by sense gratification or liberation. I simply pray that You grant me the favor of keeping me under Your lotus feet. I do not wish any kind of liberation such ass\u0101lokya(to reside on Your planet) ors\u0101r\u016bpya(to have the same bodily features as You). I simply pray for Your favor that I may be always engaged in Your loving service.\u201d",
            "Similarly, in the Sixth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 5 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it inquires from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cMy dearbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,I understand that the demon V\u1e5btr\u0101sura was a greatly sinful person and that his mentality was completely absorbed in the modes of passion and ignorance. How did he develop to such a perfectional stage of devotional service to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a? I have heard that even great persons who have undergone severe austerities and who are liberated with full knowledge must strive to become devotees of the Lord. It is understood that such persons are very rare and almost never to be seen, so I am astonished that V\u1e5btr\u0101sura became such a devotee!\u201d",
            "In the above verse, the most important thing to be noted is that there may be many liberated persons who have merged into the existence of the impersonal Brahman, but a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is very, very rare. Even out of millions of liberated persons, only one is fortunate enough to become a devotee.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,First Canto, eighth chapter, verse 20, Queen Kunt\u012b is praying to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of His departure, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are so great that You are inconceivable even to great stalwart scholars andparama-ha\u1e41sas[fully liberated souls]. So if such great sages, who are transcendental to all the reactions of material existence, are unable to know You, then as far as we are concerned, belonging to the less intelligent woman class, how is it possible for us to know Your glories? How can we understand You?\u201d In this verse, the particular thing to be noted is that the Personality of Godhead is not understood by great liberated persons, but only by devotees such as Queen Kunt\u012b in her humbleness. Although she was a woman and was considered less intelligent than a man, still she realized the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the purport of this verse.",
            "Another passage that is very important is in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,First Canto, seventh chapter, verse 10, and is called the \u201c\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101maverse.\u201d In this\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101maverse it is stated that even those who are completely liberated from material contamination are attracted by the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.* The purport of this verse is that a liberated soul has absolutely no desire at all for material enjoyment; he is wholly freed from all kinds of material desires, yet still he is irresistibly attracted by the desire to hear and understand the pastimes of the Lord. We may therefore conclude that the glories and pastimes of the Lord are not material. Otherwise, how could the liberated persons known as\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101masbe attracted by such pastimes? That is the important point in this verse.",
            "*\u00a0This\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101maverse was once nicely explained by Lord Caitanya to San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. There is a detailed explanation of this verse in the author\u2019sTeachings of Lord Caitanya.",
            "From the above statement it is found that a devotee is not after any of the stages of liberation. There are five stages of liberation, already explained as being (1) to become one with the Lord, (2) to live on the same planet as the Lord, (3) to obtain the same bodily features as the Lord, (4) to have the same opulences as the Lord and (5) to have constant association with the Lord. Out of these five liberated stages, the one which is known ass\u0101yujya,or to merge into the existence of the Lord, is the last to be accepted by a devotee. The other four liberations, although not desired by devotees, are still not against the devotional ideals. Some of the liberated persons who have achieved these four stages of liberation may also develop affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be promoted to the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet in the spiritual sky. In other words, those who are already promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets and who possess the four kinds of liberation may also sometimes develop affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and become promoted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka.",
            "So those who are in the four liberated states may still be going through different stages of existence. In the beginning they may want the opulences of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but at the mature stage the dormant love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana becomes prominent in their hearts. As such, the pure devotees never accept the liberation ofs\u0101yujya,to become one with the Supreme, though sometimes they may accept as favorable the other four liberated states.",
            "Out of many kinds of devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the one who is attracted to the original form of the Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is considered to be the foremost, first-class devotee. Such a devotee is never attracted by the opulences of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha or even of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the royal city where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ruled. The conclusion of \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b is that the devotees who are attracted by the pastimes of the Lord in Gokula,* or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, are the topmost devotees.",
            "*\u00a0V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is the transcendental place where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoys His eternal pastimes as a boy, and it is considered the topmost sphere in all existence. When this V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is exhibited in the material world the place is called Gokula, and in the spiritual world it is called Goloka, or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "A devotee who is attached to a particular form of the Lord does not wish to redirect his devotion to other forms. For example, Hanum\u0101n, the devotee of Lord R\u0101macandra, knew that there is no difference between Lord R\u0101macandra and Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and yet he still wanted to render service only unto Lord R\u0101macandra. That is due to the specific attraction of a particular devotee. There are many, many forms of the Lord, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is still the original form. Though all of the devotees of the different forms of the Lord are in the same category, still it is said that those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the topmost in the list of all devotees."

            "CHAPTER FIVE",
            "The Purity of Devotional Service",
            "All of the previous instructions imparted by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his broad statements can be summarized thus: As long as one is materially inclined or desirous of merging into the spiritual effulgence, one cannot enter into the realm of pure devotional service. Next, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that devotional service is transcendental to all material considerations and that it is not limited to any particular country, class, society or circumstance. As stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,devotional service is transcendental and has no cause. Devotional service is executed without any hope for gain, and it cannot be checked by any material circumstances. It is open for all, without any distinction, and it is the constitutional occupation of the living entities.",
            "In the Middle Ages, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya\u2019s great associate Lord Nity\u0101nanda, a class of priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nity\u0101nanda, calling themselves thegosv\u0101m\u012bcaste. They further claimed that the practice and spreading of devotional service belonged only to their particular class, which was known as Nity\u0101nanda-va\u1e41\u015ba. In this way, they exercised their artificial power for some time, until \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the powerful\u0101c\u0101ryaof the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avasamprad\u0101ya,completely smashed their idea. There was a great hard struggle for some time, but it has turned out successfully, and it is now correctly and practically established that devotional service is not restricted to a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in devotional service is already at the status of being a high-classbr\u0101hma\u1e47a.So \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s struggle for this movement has come out successful.",
            "It is on the basis of his position that anyone can now become a Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava from any part of the world or any part of the universe. Anyone who is a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is situated transcendentally, and therefore the highest qualification in the material world, namely, to be in the mode of goodness, has already been achieved by such a person. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in the Western world is based on the above-mentioned proposition of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhup\u0101da, our spiritual master. On his authority, we are claiming members from all sections of the Western countries. The so-calledbr\u0101hma\u1e47asclaim that one who is not born into abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily cannot receive the sacred thread and cannot become a high-grade Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. But we do not accept such a theory because it is not supported by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b or by the strength of the various scriptures.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b specifically mentions herein that every man has the birthright to accept devotional service and to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. He has given many evidences from many scriptures, and he has especially quoted one passage fromPadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,wherein the sage Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha tells King Dil\u012bpa, \u201cMy dear King, everyone has the right to execute devotional service, just as he has the right to take early bath in the month of M\u0101gha [December-January].\u201d There is more evidence in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a,in theK\u0101\u015b\u012b-kha\u1e47\u1e0daportion, where it is said, \u201cIn the country known as May\u016bradhvaja, the lower-caste people, who are considered less than\u015b\u016bdras,are also initiated in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult of devotional service. And when they are properly dressed, withtilakaon their bodies and beads in their hands and on their necks, they appear to be coming from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. In fact, they look so very beautiful that immediately they surpass the ordinarybr\u0101hma\u1e47as.\u201d",
            "Thus a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava automatically becomes abr\u0101hma\u1e47a.This idea is also supported by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his bookHari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa,which is the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava guide. Therein he has clearly stated that any person who is properly initiated into the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult certainly becomes abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,as much as the metal known aska\u1e41sa(bell metal) is turned into gold by the mixture of mercury. A bona fide spiritual master, under the guidance of authorities, can turn anyone to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult so that naturally he may come to the topmost position of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b warns, however, that if a person is properly initiated by a bona fide spiritual master, he should not think that simply by the acceptance of such initiation his business is then finished. One still has to follow the rules and regulations very carefully. If after accepting the spiritual master and being initiated one does not follow the rules and regulations of devotional service, then he is again fallen. One must be very vigilant to remember that he is a part and parcel of the transcendental body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that it is his duty as part and parcel to give service to the whole, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we do not render service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a then again we fall down. In other words, simply becoming initiated does not elevate one to the position of a high-classbr\u0101hma\u1e47a.One also has to discharge the duties and follow the regulative principles very rigidly.",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also says that if one is regularly discharging devotional service, there will be no question of a falldown. But even if circumstantially there is some falldown, the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava need have nothing to do with thepr\u0101ya\u015bcitta,the ritualistic ceremony for purification. If someone falls down from the principles of devotional service, he need not take to thepr\u0101ya\u015bcittaperformances for reformation. He simply has to execute the rules and regulations for discharging devotional service, and this is sufficient for his reinstatement. This is the mystery of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava (devotional) cult.",
            "Practically there are three processes for elevating one to the platform of spiritual consciousness. These processes are calledkarma, j\u00f1\u0101naandbhakti.Ritualistic performances are in the field ofkarma.Speculative processes are in the field ofj\u00f1\u0101na.One who has taken tobhakti,the devotional service of the Lord, need have nothing to do withkarmaorj\u00f1\u0101na.It has been already explained that pure devotional service is without any tinge ofkarmaorj\u00f1\u0101na. Bhaktishould have no tinge of philosophical speculation or ritualistic performances.",
            "In this connection \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives evidence from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Eleventh Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 2, in which Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Uddhava, \u201cThe distinction between qualification and disqualification may be made in this way: persons who are already elevated in discharging devotional service will never again take shelter of the processes of fruitive activity or philosophical speculation. If one sticks to devotional service and is conducted by regulative principles given by the authorities and\u0101c\u0101ryas,that is the best qualification.\u201d",
            "This statement is supported in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,First Canto, fifth chapter, verse 17, wherein \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni advises Vy\u0101sadeva thus: \u201cEven if one does not execute his specific occupational duty but immediately takes direct shelter of the lotus feet of Hari [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], there will be no fault on his part, and in all circumstances his position is secure. Even if, by some bad association, he falls down while executing devotional service, or if he doesn\u2019t finish the complete course of devotional service and dies untimely, still he is not at a loss. A person who is simply discharging his occupational duty invar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015brama,however, with no K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, practically does not gain the true benefit of human life.\u201d The purport is that all conditioned souls who are engaged very frantically in activities for sense gratification, without knowing that this process will never help them get out of material contamination, are awarded only with repeated births and deaths.",
            "In the Fifth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is clearly stated by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva to His sons, \u201cPersons engaged in fruitive activities are repeatedly accepting birth and death, and until they develop a loving feeling for V\u0101sudeva, there will be no question of getting out from these stringent laws of material nature.\u201d As such, any person who is very seriously engaged in his occupational duties in thevar\u1e47asand\u0101\u015bramas,and who does not develop love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, should be understood to be simply spoiling his human form of life.",
            "This is confirmed also in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eleventh chapter, verse 32, in which the Lord says to Uddhava, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, any person who takes shelter of Me in complete surrender and follows My instructions, giving up all occupational duties, is to be considered the first-class man.\u201d In this statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is understood that people who are generally attracted to philanthropic, ethical, moral, altruistic, political and social welfare activities may be considered nice men only in the calculation of the material world. From\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamand other authentic Vedic scriptures we learn further that if a person simply acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and discharges devotional service, he is considered to be far, far better situated than all of those persons engaged in philanthropic, ethical, moral, altruistic and social welfare activities.",
            "The same thing is still more emphatically confirmed in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Eleventh Canto, fifth chapter, verse 41, in which Karabh\u0101jana Muni addresses Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi as follows: \u201cMy dear King, if someone gives up his occupational duties as they are prescribed for the differentvar\u1e47asand\u0101\u015bramas,but takes complete shelter, surrendering himself unto the lotus feet of the Lord, such a person is no more a debtor, nor has he any obligation to perform the different kinds of activities we render to the great sages, ancestors, living entities and family and society members. Nor has he any need to bother executing the five kinds ofyaj\u00f1\u0101s[sacrifices] for becoming free from sinful contamination. Simply by discharging devotional service, he is freed from all kinds of obligations.\u201d The purport is that as soon as a man takes his birth he is immediately indebted to so many sources. He is indebted to the great sages because he profits by reading their authoritative scriptures and books. For example, we take advantage of the books written by Vy\u0101sadeva. Vy\u0101sadeva has left for us all theVedas.Before Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s writing, the Vedic literature was simply heard and the disciples would learn themantrasquickly by hearing and not by reading. Later on, Vy\u0101sadeva thought it wise to write down theVedas,because in this age people are short-memoried and unable to remember all the instructions given by the spiritual master. Therefore, he left all the Vedic knowledge in the form of books, such as thePur\u0101\u1e47as, Ved\u0101nta, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rataand\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.",
            "There are many other sages, like \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, Gautama Muni and N\u0101rada Muni, to whom we are indebted because we take advantage of their knowledge. Similarly, we are obliged to our forefathers because we take our birth in a particular family, where we take all advantages and inherit property. Therefore, we are indebted to the forefathers and have to offer thempi\u1e47\u1e0da(pras\u0101da) after they are dead. Similarly, to the people in general we are also indebted, as well as to our relatives, friends and even animals such as cows and dogs who render us so much service.",
            "In this way, we are indebted to the demigods, to the forefathers, to the sages, to the animals and to society in general. It is our duty to repay them all by proper discharge of service. But by the one stroke of devotional service, if someone gives up all obligations and simply surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is no longer a debtor nor obliged to any other source of benefit.",
            "InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101also the Lord says, \u201cGive up all your occupations and just become surrendered unto Me. I give you assurance that I shall give you protection from all sinful reactions.\u201d One may think that because he is surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead he will not be able to perform all of his other obligations. But the Lord says repeatedly, \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t consider that because you are giving up all other engagements there will be some flaw in your life. Don\u2019t think like that. I will give you all protection.\u201d That is the assurance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "There is additional evidence in theAgastya-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:\u201cAs the regulative principles of scripture are not required by a liberated person, so the ritualistic principles indicated in the Vedic supplements are also not required for a person duly engaged in the service of Lord R\u0101macandra.\u201d In other words, the devotees of Lord R\u0101macandra, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are already liberated persons and are not required to follow all the regulative principles mentioned in the ritualistic portions of the Vedic literature.",
            "Similarly, in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,fifth chapter, verse 42, Karabh\u0101jana Muni addresses King Nimi and says, \u201cMy dear King, a person who has given up the worship of the demigods and has completely concentrated his energy in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has become very, very dear to the Lord. As such, if by chance or mistake he does something that is forbidden, there is no need for him to perform any purificatory ceremonies. Because the Lord is situated within his heart, He takes compassion for the devotee\u2019s accidental mistake and corrects him from within.\u201d It is also confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in many places that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, takes a special interest in His devotees and declares emphatically that nothing can cause His devotees to fall down. He is always protecting them."

            "CHAPTER SIX",
            "How to Discharge Devotional Service",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that his elder brother (San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b) has compiledHari-bhakti-vil\u0101safor the guidance of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and therein has mentioned many rules and regulations to be followed by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Some of them are very important and prominent, and \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b will now mention these very important items for our benefit. The purport of this statement is that \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b proposes to mention only basic principles, not details. For example, a basic principle is that one has to accept a spiritual master. Exactly how one follows the instructions of his spiritual master is considered a detail. For example, if one is following the instruction of his spiritual master and that instruction is different from the instructions of another spiritual master, this is called detailed information. But the basic principle of acceptance of a spiritual master is good everywhere, although the details may be different. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b does not wish to enter into details here, but wants to place before us only the principles.",
            "He mentions the basic principles as follows: (1) accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, (2) becoming initiated by the spiritual master and learning how to discharge devotional service from him, (3) obeying the orders of the spiritual master with faith and devotion, (4) following in the footsteps of great\u0101c\u0101ryas(teachers) under the direction of the spiritual master, (5) inquiring from the spiritual master how to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, (6) being prepared to give up anything material for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (this means that when we are engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we must be prepared to give up something that we may not like to give up, and also we have to accept something that we may not like to accept), (7) residing in a sacred place of pilgrimage like Dv\u0101rak\u0101 or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, (8) accepting only what is necessary, or dealing with the material world only as far as necessary, (9) observing the fasting day on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b and (10) worshiping sacred trees like the banyan tree.",
            "These ten items are preliminary necessities for beginning the discharge of devotional service in regulative principles. In the beginning, if a neophyte devotee observes the above-mentioned ten principles, surely he will quickly make good advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "The next set of instructions is listed as follows: (1) One should rigidly give up the company of nondevotees. (2) One should not instruct a person who is not desirous of accepting devotional service. (3) One should not be very enthusiastic about constructing costly temples or monasteries. (4) One should not try to read too many books, nor should one develop the idea of earning his livelihood by lecturing on or professionally reciting\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamorBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.(5) One should not be neglectful in ordinary dealings. (6) One should not be under the spell of lamentation in loss or jubilation in gain. (7) One should not disrespect the demigods. (8) One should not give unnecessary trouble to any living entity. (9) One should carefully avoid the various offenses in chanting the holy name of the Lord or in worshiping the Deity in the temple. (10) One should be very intolerant toward the blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His devotees.",
            "Without following the above-mentioned ten principles, one cannot properly elevate himself to the platform ofs\u0101dhana-bhakti,or devotional service in practice. Altogether, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions twenty items, and all of them are very important. Out of the twenty, the first three\u00a0\u2013 namely, accepting the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, taking initiation from him and serving him with respect and reverence\u00a0\u2013 are the most important.",
            "The next important items are as follows: (1) One should decorate the body withtilaka,which is the sign of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. (The idea is that as soon as a person sees these marks on the body of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he will immediately remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya said that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is he who, when seen, reminds one of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, it is essential that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava mark his body withtilakato remind others of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.) (2) In marking suchtilaka,sometimes one may write Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the body. (3) One should accept flowers and garlands that have been offered to the Deity and the spiritual master and put them on one\u2019s body. (4) One should learn to dance before the Deity. (5) One should learn to bow down immediately upon seeing the Deity or the spiritual master. (6) As soon as one visits a temple of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one must stand up. (7) When the Deity is being borne for a stroll in the street, a devotee should immediately follow the procession. (In this connection it may be noted that in India, especially in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temples, the system is that apart from the big Deity who is permanently situated in the main area of the temple, there is a set of smaller Deities that are taken in procession in the evening. In some temples it is the custom to hold a big procession in the evening with a band playing and a nice big umbrella over the Deities, who sit on decorated thrones on the cart or palanquin, which is carried by devotees. The Deities come out onto the street and travel in the neighborhood while the people of the neighborhood come out to offerpras\u0101da.The residents of the neighborhood all follow the procession, so it is a very nice scene. When the Deity is coming out, the servitors in the temple put forward the daily accounts before Them: so much was the collection, so much was the expenditure. The whole idea is that the Deity is considered to be the proprietor of the whole establishment, and all the priests and other people taking care of the temple are considered to be the servants of the Deity. This system is very, very old and is still followed. So therefore it is mentioned here that when the Deity is on stroll the people should follow behind.) (8) A devotee must visit a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temple at least once or twice every day, morning and evening. (In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana this system is followed very strictly. All the devotees in town go every morning and evening to visit different temples. Therefore during these times there are considerable crowds all over the city. There are about five thousand temples in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana city. Of course it is not possible to visit all the temples, but there are at least one dozen very big and important temples, which were started by the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs and which should be visited.)",
            "(9) One must circumambulate the temple building at least three times. (In every temple there is an arrangement to go around the temple at least three times. Some devotees go around more than three times\u00a0\u2013 ten times, fifteen times\u00a0\u2013 according to their vows. The Gosv\u0101m\u012bs used to circumambulate Govardhana Hill.) One should also circumambulate the whole V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana area. (10) One must worship the Deity in the temple according to the regulative principles. (Offering\u0101ratiandpras\u0101da,decorating the Deity, etc.\u00a0\u2013 these things must be observed regularly.) (11) One must render personal service to the Deities. (12) One must sing. (13) One must performsa\u1e45k\u012brtana.(14) One must chant. (15) One must offer prayers. (16) One must recite notable prayers. (17) One must tastemah\u0101-pras\u0101da(food from the very plate offered before the Deities). (18) One must drinkcara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta(water from the bathing of the Deities, which is offered to guests). (19) One must smell the incense and flowers offered to the Deity. (20) One must touch the lotus feet of the Deity. (21) One must see the Deity with great devotion. (22) One must offer\u0101rati(\u0101r\u0101trika) at different times. (23) One must hear about the Lord and His pastimes from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and similar books. (24) One must pray to the Deity for His mercy. (25) One should remember the Deity. (26) One should meditate upon the Deity. (27) One should render some voluntary service. (28) One should think of the Lord as one\u2019s friend. (29) One should offer everything to the Lord. (30) One should offer a favorite article (such as food or a garment). (31) One should take all kinds of risks and perform all endeavors for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s benefit. (32) In every condition, one should be a surrendered soul. (33) One should pour water on thetulas\u012btree. (34) One should regularly hear\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamand similar literature. (35) One should live in a sacred place like Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Dv\u0101rak\u0101. (36) One should offer service to Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas (devotees). (37) One should arrange one\u2019s devotional service according to one\u2019s means. (38) In the month of K\u0101rttika (October and November), one should make arrangements for special services. (39) During Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b (the time of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance in this world) one should observe a special service. (40) One should do whatever is done with great care and devotion for the Deity. (41) One should relish the pleasure ofBh\u0101gavatamreading among devotees and not among outsiders. (42) One should associate with devotees who are considered more advanced. (43) One should chant the holy name of the Lord. (44) One should live in the jurisdiction of Mathur\u0101.",
            "Now the total regulative principles come to an aggregate of sixty-four items. As we have mentioned, the first are the primary ten regulative principles. Then come the secondary ten regulative principles, and added to these are forty-four other activities. So all together there are sixty-four items for discharging the regulative practice of devotional service. Out of these sixty-four items, five items\u00a0\u2013 namely, worshiping the Deity, hearing\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,associating among the devotees,sa\u1e45k\u012brtana,and living in Mathur\u0101\u00a0\u2013 are very important.",
            "The sixty-four items of devotional service should include all of our activities of body, mind and speech. As stated in the beginning, the regulative principle of devotional service enjoins that all of our senses must be employed in the service of the Lord. Exactly how they can be thus employed is described in the above sixty-four items. Now \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b will give evidence from different scriptures supporting the authenticity of many of these points."

            "Evidence Regarding Devotional Principles",
            "ACCEPTING THE SHELTER OF A BONA FIDE SPIRITUAL MASTER",
            "In the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,third chapter, verse 21, Prabuddha tells Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi, \u201cMy dear King, please know for certain that in the material world there is no happiness. It is simply a mistake to think that there is happiness here, because this place is full of nothing but miserable conditions. Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters. Everyone should try to find such a bona fide spiritual master in order to fulfill his mission of life, which is to transfer himself to the plane of spiritual bliss.\u201d",
            "The purport is that one should not accept as a spiritual master someone who is fool number one, who has no direction according to the scriptural injunctions, whose character is doubtful, who does not follow the principles of devotional service, or who has not conquered the influence of the six sense-gratifying agents. The six agents of sense gratification are the tongue, the genitals, the belly, anger, the mind and words. Anyone who has practiced controlling these six is permitted to make disciples all over the world. To accept such a spiritual master is the crucial point for advancement in spiritual life. One who is fortunate enough to come under the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master is sure to traverse the path of spiritual salvation without any doubt.",
            "ACCEPTING INITIATION FROM THE SPIRITUAL MASTER AND RECEIVINGINSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM",
            "Sage Prabuddha continued to speak to the king as follows: \u201cMy dear king, a disciple has to accept the spiritual master not only as spiritual master, but also as the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supersoul. In other words, the disciple should accept the spiritual master as God, because he is the external manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in every scripture, and a disciple should accept the spiritual master as such. One should learn\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamseriously and with all respect and veneration for the spiritual master. Hearing and speaking\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis the religious process that elevates one to the platform of serving and loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d",
            "The attitude of the disciple should be to satisfy the bona fide spiritual master. Then it will be very easy for him to understand spiritual knowledge. This is confirmed in theVedas,and R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b will further explain that for a person who has unflinching faith in God and the spiritual master, everything becomes revealed very easily.",
            "SERVING THE SPIRITUAL MASTER WITH FAITH AND CONFIDENCE",
            "Regarding accepting initiation from the spiritual master, in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,seventeenth chapter, verse 27, it is stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, the spiritual master must be accepted not only as My representative, but as My very self. He must never be considered on the same level with an ordinary human being. One should never be envious of the spiritual master, as one may be envious of an ordinary man. The spiritual master should always be seen as the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by serving the spiritual master one is able to serve all the demigods.\u201d",
            "FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF SAINTLY PERSONS",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is advised that a devotee follow the past\u0101c\u0101ryasand saintly persons because by such following one can achieve the desired results, with no chance of lamenting or being baffled in his progress.",
            "The scripture known asBrahma-y\u0101malastates as follows: \u201cIf someone wants to pose himself as a great devotee without following the authorities of the revealed scriptures, then his activities will never help him to make progress in devotional service. Instead, he will simply create disturbances for the sincere students of devotional service.\u201d Those who do not strictly follow the principles of revealed scriptures are generally calledsahajiy\u0101s\u00a0\u2013those who have imagined everything to be cheap, who have their own concocted ideas, and who do not follow the scriptural injunctions. Such persons are simply creating disturbances in the discharge of devotional service.",
            "In this connection, an objection may be raised by those who are not in devotional service and who do not care for the revealed scriptures. An example of this is seen in Buddhist philosophy. Lord Buddha appeared in the family of a high-gradek\u1e63atriyaking, but his philosophy was not in accord with the Vedic conclusions and therefore was rejected. Under the patronage of a Hindu king, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja A\u015boka, the Buddhist religion was spread all over India and the adjoining countries. However, after the appearance of the great stalwart teacher \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, this Buddhism was driven out beyond the borders of India.",
            "The Buddhists or other religionists who do not care for revealed scriptures sometimes say that there are many devotees of Lord Buddha who show devotional service to Lord Buddha and who therefore should be considered devotees. In answer to this argument, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the followers of Buddha cannot be accepted as devotees. Although Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the followers of such incarnations are not very advanced in their knowledge of theVedas.To study theVedasmeans to come to the conclusion of the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore any religious principle that denies the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead is not accepted and is called atheism. Atheism means defying the authority of theVedasand decrying the great\u0101c\u0101ryaswho teach Vedic scriptures for the benefit of the people in general.",
            "Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,but in the same\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated that Lord Buddha appeared in order to bewilder the atheistic class of men. Therefore his philosophy is meant for bewildering the atheists and should not be accepted. If someone asks, \u201cWhy should K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a propagate atheistic principles?\u201d the answer is that it was the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to end the violence which was then being committed in the name of theVedas.The so-called religionists were falsely using theVedasto justify such violent acts as meat-eating, and Lord Buddha came to lead the fallen people away from such a false interpretation of theVedas.Also, for the atheists Lord Buddha preached atheism so that they would follow him and thus be tricked into devotional service to Lord Buddha, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "INQUIRING ABOUT ETERNAL RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES",
            "In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said, \u201cIf one is actually very serious about devotional service, then all of his purposes will be served without any delay.\u201d",
            "BEING PREPARED TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING MATERIAL FOR K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A\u2019S SATISFACTION",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cFor one who has given up his material sense enjoyment and has accepted the principles of devotional service, the opulence of Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka [the kingdom of God] is awaiting.\u201d",
            "RESIDING IN A SACRED PLACE",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is also said that for a person who has lived in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 for six months, for one month, or even for one fortnight, there is awaiting elevation to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-lokas and all the profits ofs\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti(the privilege of having the same four-handed bodily features as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a).",
            "In theBrahm\u0101 Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said, \u201cThe transcendental significance of Puru\u1e63ottama-k\u1e63etra, which is the eighty-square-mile field of Lord Jagann\u0101tha, cannot be properly described. Even the demigods from the higher planetary systems see the inhabitants of this Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b as having exactly the same bodily features possessed by one in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. That is, the demigods see the inhabitants of Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b as being four-handed.\u201d",
            "When there was a meeting of great sages at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya, S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b was reciting\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,and the importance of the Ganges was stated as follows: \u201cThe waters of the Ganges are always carrying the flavor oftulas\u012boffered at the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as such the waters of the Ganges are ever flowing, spreading the glories of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Wherever the waters of the Ganges are flowing, all will be sanctified, both externally and internally.\u201d",
            "ACCEPTING ONLY WHAT IS NECESSARY",
            "In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is directed, \u201cOne should not accept more than necessary if he is serious about discharging devotional service.\u201d The purport is that one should not neglect following the principles of devotional service, nor should one accept the rulings of devotional service that are more than what he can easily perform. For example, it may be said that one should chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantraat least one hundred thousand times daily on his beads. But if this is not possible, then one must minimize his chanting according to his own capacity. Generally, we recommend our disciples to chant at least sixteen rounds on theirjapabeads daily, and this should be completed. But if one is not even able to chant sixteen rounds, then he must make it up the next day. He must be sure to keep his vow. If he does not strictly follow this out, then he is sure to be negligent. That is offensive in the service of the Lord. If we encourage offenses, we shall not be able to make progress in devotional service. It is better if one fixes up a regulative principle according to his own ability and then follows that vow without fail. That will make him advanced in spiritual life.",
            "OBSERVING FASTING ON EK\u0100DA\u015a\u012a",
            "In theBrahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said that one who observes fasting on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is freed from all kinds of reactions to sinful activities and advances in pious life. The basic principle is not just to fast but to increase one\u2019s faith and love for Govinda, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The real reason for observing fasting on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is to minimize the demands of the body and to engage our time in the service of the Lord by chanting or performing similar service. The best thing to do on fasting days is to remember the pastimes of Govinda and to hear His holy name constantly.",
            "OFFERING RESPECT TO THE BANYAN TREES",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is directed that a devotee should offer water to thetulas\u012bplant and\u0101malakatrees. He should offer respect to the cows and to thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asand should serve the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by offering them respectful obeisances and meditating upon them. All of these processes will help the devotee to diminish the reactions to his past sinful activities.",
            "GIVING UP THE COMPANY OF NONDEVOTEES",
            "Lord Caitanya was once asked by one of His householder devotees what the general behavior of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should be. In this connection, Lord Caitanya replied that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should always give up the company of nondevotees. Then He explained that there are two kinds of nondevotees: one class is against the supremacy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and another class is too materialistic. In other words, those who are after material enjoyment and those who are against the supremacy of the Lord are calledavai\u1e63\u1e47ava,and their company should be strictly avoided.",
            "In theK\u0101ty\u0101yana-sa\u1e41hit\u0101it is stated that even if one is forced to live in a cage of iron or in the midst of a blazing fire, he should accept this position rather than live with nondevotees who are through and through against the supremacy of the Lord. Similarly, in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-rahasyathere is a statement to the effect that one should prefer to embrace a snake, a tiger or an alligator rather than associate with persons who are worshipers of various demigods and who are impelled by material desire.",
            "In the scriptures it is instructed that one may worship a certain demigod if he is desirous of achieving some material gain. For example, one is advised to worship the sun-god if he is desirous of getting rid of a diseased condition. For a beautiful wife, one may worship Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, and for advanced education one may worship Sarasvat\u012b. Similarly, there is a list in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamfor worshipers of all demigods according to different material desires. But all of these worshipers, although they appear to be very good devotees of the demigods, are still considered to be nondevotees. They cannot be accepted as devotees.",
            "The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs (impersonalists) say that one may worship any form of the Lord and that it doesn\u2019t matter, because one reaches the same destination anyway. But it is clearly stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that those who are worshipers of the demigods will ultimately reach only the planets of those demigods, while those who are devotees of the Lord Himself will be promoted to the Lord\u2019s abode, the kingdom of God. So actually these persons who are worshipers of demigods have been condemned in theG\u012bt\u0101.It is described that due to their lusty desires they have lost their intelligence and have therefore taken to worshiping the different demigods. So in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-rahasyathese demigod worshipers are forcefully condemned by the statement that it is better to live with the most dangerous animals than to associate with these persons.",
            "NOT ACCEPTING UNFIT DISCIPLES, CONSTRUCTING MANY TEMPLES OR READING MANY BOOKS",
            "Another stricture is that a person may have many disciples, but he should not act in such a way that he will be obliged to any of them for some particular action or some favor. And one should also not be very enthusiastic about constructing new temples, nor should one be enthusiastic about reading various types of books save and except the ones that lead to the advancement of devotional service. Practically, if one very carefully readsBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanyaand thisNectar of Devotion,that will give him sufficient knowledge to understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One need not take the trouble of reading other books.",
            "In the Seventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,thirteenth chapter, verse 8, N\u0101rada Muni, while discussing with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira the various functions of the different orders in society, especially mentions rules for thesanny\u0101s\u012bs,those persons who have renounced this material world. One who has accepted thesanny\u0101saorder of life is forbidden to accept as a disciple anyone who is not fit. Asanny\u0101s\u012bshould first of all examine whether a prospective student is sincerely seeking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If he is not, he should not be accepted. However, Lord Caitanya\u2019s causeless mercy is such that He advised all bona fide spiritual masters to speak about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Therefore, in the line of Lord Caitanya even thesanny\u0101s\u012bscan speak about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere, and if someone is seriously inclined to become a disciple, thesanny\u0101s\u012balways accepts him.",
            "The one point is that without increasing the number of disciples, there is no propagation of the cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, sometimes even at a risk, asanny\u0101s\u012bin the line of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu may accept even a person who is not thoroughly fit to become a disciple. Later on, by the mercy of such a bona fide spiritual master, the disciple is gradually elevated. However, if one increases the number of disciples simply for some prestige or false honor, he will surely fall down in the matter of executing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Similarly, a bona fide spiritual master has no business reading many books simply to show his proficiency or to get popularity by lecturing in different places. One should avoid all these things. It is also stated that asanny\u0101s\u012bshould not be enthusiastic about constructing temples. We can see in the lives of various\u0101c\u0101ryasin the line of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu that they are not very enthusiastic about constructing temples. However, if somebody comes forward to offer some service, the same reluctant\u0101c\u0101ryaswill encourage the building of costly temples by such servitors. For example, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b was offered a favor by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja M\u0101nsi\u1e45gh, the commander-in-chief of Emperor Akhbar, and R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b instructed him to construct a large temple for Govindaj\u012b, which cost vast amounts of money.",
            "So a bona fide spiritual master should not personally take any responsibility for constructing temples, but if someone has money and wants to spend it in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, an\u0101c\u0101ryalike R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b may utilize the devotee\u2019s money to construct a nice, costly temple for the service of the Lord. Unfortunately, it happens that someone who is not fit to become a spiritual master may approach wealthy persons to contribute for temple constructions. If such money is utilized by unqualified spiritual masters for living comfortably in costly temples without actually doing any preaching work, this is not acceptable. In other words, a spiritual master needn\u2019t be very enthusiastic for constructing temple buildings simply in the name of so-called spiritual advancement. Rather, his first and foremost activity should be to preach. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommended that a spiritual master print books. If one has money, instead of constructing costly temples, one should spend his money for the publication of authorized books in different languages for propagating the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement.",
            "STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS IN ORDINARY DEALINGS AND EQUILIBRIUM IN LOSS AND GAIN",
            "There is a statement in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a:\u201cPersons who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should never be disturbed by some material gain or loss. Even if there is some material loss, one should not be perturbed, but should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself.\u201d The purport is that every conditioned soul is always absorbed in thinking of materialistic activities; he has to free himself from such thoughts and transfer himself completely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As we have already explained, the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not be disturbed in material loss, but, rather, should concentrate his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord.",
            "A devotee should not be subjected to lamentation or illusion. There is the following statement in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a:\u201cWithin the heart of a person who is overpowered by lamentation or anger, there is no possibility of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being manifested.\u201d",
            "THE DEMIGODS",
            "One should not neglect to offer due respect to the demigods. One may not be a devotee of demigods, but that does not mean that he should be disrespectful to them. For example, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is not a devotee of Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101, but he is duty-bound to offer all respects to such highly positioned demigods. According to Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, one should offer respect even to an ant, so then what is there to speak of such exalted persons as Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101?",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Hari, is the master of all demigods, and therefore He is always worshipable. But this does not mean that one should not offer respect to the demigods.\u201d",
            "NOT GIVING PAIN TO ANY LIVING ENTITY",
            "This is the statement ofMah\u0101bh\u0101rata:\u201cA person who does not disturb or cause painful action in the mind of any living entity, who treats everyone just like a loving father does his children, whose heart is so pure, certainly very soon becomes favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d",
            "In so-called civilized society there is sometimes agitation against cruelty to animals, but at the same time regular slaughterhouses are always maintained. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is not like that. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava can never support animal slaughter or even give pain to any living entity."

            "Offenses to Be Avoided",
            "In the supplementary Vedic literature, there is the following list of thirty-two offenses in the matter of serving the Lord: (1) One should not enter the temple of the Deity in a car or palanquin or with shoes on the feet. (2) One should not fail to observe the various festivals for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such as Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b and Ratha-y\u0101tr\u0101. (3) One should not avoid bowing down before the Deity. (4) One should not enter the temple to worship the Lord without having washed one\u2019s hands and feet after eating. (5) One should not enter the temple in a contaminated state. (According to Vedic scripture, if someone dies in the family the whole family becomes contaminated for some time, according to its status. For example, if the family isbr\u0101hma\u1e47atheir contamination period is twelve days, for thek\u1e63atriyasandvai\u015byasit is fifteen days, and for\u015b\u016bdrasthirty days.) (6) One should not bow down on one hand. (7) One should not circumambulate in front of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (The process of circumambulating the temple is that one should begin circumambulating from the Deity\u2019s right-hand side of the temple and come round. Such circumambulation should be performed outside the temple structure at least three times daily.) (8) One should not spread his legs before the Deity. (9) One should not sit before the Deity holding the ankles, elbows or knees with one\u2019s hands. (10) One should not lie down before the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (11) One should not acceptpras\u0101dabefore the Deity. (12) One should never speak a lie before the Deity. (13) One should not talk very loudly before the Deity. (14) One should not talk with others before the Deity. (15) One should not cry or howl before the Deity. (16) One should not quarrel or fight before the Deity. (17) One should not chastise anyone before the Deity. (18) One should not be charitable to beggars before the Deity. (19) One should not speak very harshly to others before the Deity. (20) One should not wear a fur blanket before the Deity. (21) One should not eulogize or praise anyone else before the Deity. (22) One should not speak any ill names before the Deity. (23) One should not pass air before the Deity. (24) One should not fail to worship the Deity according to one\u2019s means. (InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is stated that the Lord is satisfied if some devotee offers Him even a leaf or a little water. This formula prescribed by the Lord is universally applicable, even for the poorest man. But that does not mean that one who has sufficient means to worship the Lord very nicely should also adopt this method and try to satisfy the Lord simply by offering water and a leaf. If he has sufficient means, he should offer nice decorations, nice flowers and nice foodstuffs and observe all ceremonies. It is not that one should try to satisfy the Supreme Lord with a little water and a leaf, and for himself spend all his money in sense gratification.) (25) One should not eat anything that is not offered first to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (26) One should not fail to offer fresh fruit and grains to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a according to the season. (27) After food has been cooked, no one should be offered any foodstuff unless it is first offered to the Deity. (28) One should not sit with his back toward the Deity. (29) One should not offer obeisances silently to the spiritual master, or in other words, one should recitealoudthe prayers to the spiritual master while offering obeisances. (30) One should not fail to offer some praise in the presence of the spiritual master. (31) One should not praise himself before the spiritual master. (32) One should not deride the demigods before the Deity.",
            "This is a list of thirty-two offenses. Besides these there are a number of offenses which are mentioned in theVar\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a.They are as follows: (1) One should not touch the Deity in a dark room. (2) One should not fail to strictly follow the rules and regulations in worshiping the Deity. (3) One should not enter the temple of the Deity without first making some sound. (4) One should not offer any foodstuff to the Deity which has been seen by dogs or other lower animals. (5) One should not break silence while worshiping. (6) One should not pass urine or evacuate while engaged in worshiping. (7) One should not offer incense without offering some flower. (8) Useless flowers without any fragrance should not be offered. (9) One should not fail to wash his teeth very carefully every day. (10) One should not enter the temple directly after sexual intercourse. (11) One should not enter the temple after touching a woman during her menstrual period. (12) One should not enter the temple after touching a dead body. (13) One should not enter the temple wearing garments of red or blue color or garments which are unwashed. (14) One should not enter the temple after seeing a dead body. (15) One should not pass air within the temple. (16) One should not be angry within the temple. (17) One should not enter the temple after visiting a crematorium. (18) One should not belch before the Deity. So, until one has fully digested his food, he should not enter the temple. (19) One should not smoke marijuana, orga\u00f1j\u0101.(20) One should not take opium or similar intoxicants. (21) One should not enter the Deity room or touch the body of the Deity after having smeared oil over his body. (22) One should not show disrespect to a scripture teaching about the supremacy of the Lord. (23) One should not introduce any opposing scripture. (24) One should not chew betel before the Deity. (25) One should not offer a flower that was kept in an unclean pot. (26) One should not worship the Lord while sitting on the bare floor; one must have a sitting place or carpet. (27) One should not touch the Deity before one has completed taking bath. (28) One should not decorate his forehead with the three-linedtilaka.(29) One should not enter the temple without washing his hands and feet.",
            "Other rules are that one should not offer foodstuff which is cooked by a non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one should not worship the Deity before a nondevotee, and one should not engage himself in the worship of the Lord while seeing a nondevotee. One should not worship the Deity without first worshiping the demigod Ga\u1e47apati, who drives away all impediments in the execution of devotional service. In theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101it is stated that Ga\u1e47apati worships the lotus feet of Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva and in that way has become auspicious for the devotees in clearing out all impediments. Therefore, all devotees should worship Ga\u1e47apati. The Deities should not be bathed in water that has been touched by the nails or fingers. When a devotee is perspiring, he should not engage himself in worshiping the Deity. Similarly, there are many other prohibitions. For example, one should not cross or step over the flowers offered to the Deities, nor should one take a vow in the name of God. These are all different kinds of offenses in the matter of executing devotional service, and one should be careful to avoid them.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated that even a person whose life is completely sinful will be completely protected by the Lord if he simply surrenders unto Him. So it is accepted that one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes free from all sinful reactions. And even when a person becomes an offender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, he can still be delivered simply by taking shelter of the holy names of the Lord: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. In other words, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is beneficial for eradicating all sins, but if one becomes an offender to the holy names of the Lord, then he has no chance of being delivered.",
            "The offenses against the chanting of the holy name are as follows: (1) To blaspheme the devotees who have dedicated their lives for propagating the holy name of the Lord. (2) To consider the names of demigods like Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101 to be equal to, or independent of, the name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. (Sometimes the atheistic class of men take it that any demigod is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. But one who is a devotee knows that no demigod, however great he may be, is independently as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, if someone thinks that he can chant \u201cK\u0101l\u012b, K\u0101l\u012b!\u201d or \u201cDurg\u0101, Durg\u0101!\u201dand it is the same as Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is the greatest offense.) (3) To disobey the orders of the spiritual master. (4) To blaspheme the Vedic literature or literature in pursuance of the Vedic version. (5) To consider the glories of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be imagination. (6) To give some interpretation on the holy name of the Lord. (7) To commit sinful activities on the strength of the holy name of the Lord. (It should not be taken that because by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can be freed from all kinds of sinful reaction, one may continue to act sinfully and after that chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to neutralize his sins. Such a dangerous mentality is very offensive and should be avoided.) (8) To consider the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one of the auspicious ritualistic activities offered in theVedasas fruitive activities (karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da). (9) To instruct a faithless person about the glories of the holy name. (Anyone can take part in chanting the holy name of the Lord, but in the beginning one should not be instructed about the transcendental potency of the Lord. Those who are too sinful cannot appreciate the transcendental glories of the Lord, and therefore it is better not to instruct them in this matter.) (10) To not have complete faith in the chanting of the holy names and to maintain material attachments, even after understanding so many instructions on this matter.",
            "Every devotee who claims to be a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava must guard against these offenses in order to quickly achieve the desired success."

            "Further Consideration of Devotional Principles",
            "BLASPHEMY",
            "One should not tolerate blasphemy of the Lord or His devotees. In this connection, in the Tenth Canto, seventy-fourth chapter, verse 40 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cMy dear King, if a person, after hearing blasphemous propaganda against the Lord and His devotees, does not go away from that place, he becomes bereft of the effect of all pious activities.\u201d",
            "In one of Lord Caitanya\u2019s\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dakaverses it is stated, \u201cThe devotee should be more tolerant than the tree and more submissive than the grass. He should offer all honor to others but may not accept any honor for himself.\u201d In spite of Lord Caitanya\u2019s being so humble and meek as a devotee, when He was informed about injuries inflicted on the body of \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda, He immediately ran to the spot and wanted to kill the offenders, Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i. This behavior of Lord Caitanya\u2019s is very significant. It shows that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava may be very tolerant and meek, foregoing everything for his personal honor, but when it is a question of the honor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His devotee, he will not tolerate any insult.",
            "There are three ways of dealing with such insults. If someone is heard blaspheming by words, one should be so expert that he can defeat the opposing party by argument. If he is unable to defeat the opposing party, then the next step is that he should not just stand there meekly but should give up his life. The third process is followed if he is unable to execute the above-mentioned two processes, and this is that he must leave the place and go away. If a devotee does not follow any of the above-mentioned three processes, he falls down from his position of devotion.",
            "TILAKA AND TULAS\u012a BEADS",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement describing how a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should decorate his body withtilakaand beads: \u201cPersons who puttulas\u012bbeads on the neck, who mark twelve places of their bodies as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temples with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s symbolic representations [the four items held in the four hands of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u00a0\u2013 conch, mace, disc and lotus], and who havevi\u1e63\u1e47u-tilakaon their foreheads, are to be understood as the devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in this world. Their presence makes the world purified, and anywhere they remain, they make that place as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.\u201d",
            "A similar statement is in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a,which says, \u201cPersons who are decorated withtilakaorgop\u012b-candana[a kind of clay resembling fuller\u2019s earth that is produced in certain quarters of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana], and who mark their bodies all over with the holy names of the Lord, and on whose necks and breasts there aretulas\u012bbeads, are never approached by the Yama-d\u016btas.\u201d The Yama-d\u016btas are the constables of King Yama (the lord of death), who punishes all sinful men. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are never called for by such constables of Yamar\u0101ja. In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,in the narration of Aj\u0101mila\u2019s deliverance, it is said that Yamar\u0101ja gave clear instructions to his assistants not to approach the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are beyond the jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja\u2019s activities.",
            "ThePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aalso mentions, \u201cA person whose body is decorated with the pulp of sandalwood with paintings of the holy name of the Lord is delivered from all sinful reactions, and after his death he goes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka to live in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d",
            "ACCEPTING FLOWER GARLANDS",
            "The next instruction is that one should put on flower garlands that are offered to the Deity. In this connection, in the Eleventh Canto, sixth chapter, verse 46 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Uddhava says to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I have taken things that You have used and enjoyed, such as garlands of flowers, scented oils, garments and ornaments, and I eat only the remnants of Your foodstuff, because I am Your menial servant. So therefore I am sure that I shall not be attacked by the spell of the material energy.\u201d The purport of this verse is that for any person who simply follows these rules and regulations of decorating the body with the marks oftilakamade fromgop\u012b-candanaor sandalwood pulp, and who puts on the garlands that were offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no question of being conquered by the spell of the material energy. At the time of death, there is no question of such a person\u2019s being called by the constables of Yamar\u0101ja. Even if one does not accept all the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles but still takes the remnants of foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ork\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da,he will gradually become qualified to rise to the platform of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.",
            "Similarly, in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47aLord Brahm\u0101 tells N\u0101rada, \u201cMy dear N\u0101rada, anyone who puts on his neck the flower garland which was formerly used by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes relieved from all disease and reactions to sinful activities, and gradually he is liberated from the contamination of matter.\u201d",
            "DANCING BEFORE THE DEITY",
            "In theDv\u0101rak\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmyathe importance of dancing before the Deity is stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cA person who is in a jubilant spirit, who feels profound devotional ecstasy while dancing before Me, and who manifests different features of bodily expression can burn away all the accumulated sinful reactions he has stocked up for many, many thousands of years.\u201d In the same book there is a statement by N\u0101rada wherein he asserts, \u201cFrom the body of any person who claps and dances before the Deity, showing manifestations of ecstasy, all the birds of sinful activities fly away upward.\u201d Just as by clapping the hands one can cause many birds to fly away, similarly the birds of all sinful activities, which are sitting on the body, can be made to fly away simply by dancing and clapping before the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "BOWING DOWN IN HONOR OF THE DEITY",
            "In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about bowing down and offering respect to the Deity. It is said there, \u201cA person who has performed a great ritualistic sacrifice and a person who has simply offered his respectful obeisances by bowing down before the Lord cannot be held as equals.\u201d The person who has executed many great sacrifices will attain the result of his pious activities, but when such results are finished, he has to take birth again on the earthly planet; however, the person who has once offered respects, bowing down before the Deity, will not come back to this world, because he will go directly to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "STANDING UP TO RECEIVE THE LORD",
            "In theBrahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said, \u201cA person who sees the Lord\u2019s Ratha-y\u0101tr\u0101 car festival and then stands up to receive the Lord can purge all kinds of sinful results from his body.\u201d",
            "FOLLOWING THE DEITY",
            "A similar statement is there in theBhavi\u1e63ya Pur\u0101\u1e47a,in which it is said, \u201cEven if born of a lowly family, a person who follows the Ratha-y\u0101tr\u0101 car when the Deities pass in front or from behind will surely be elevated to the position of achieving equal opulence with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d",
            "GOING TO THE TEMPLE OF VI\u1e62\u1e46U OR TO PLACES OF PILGRIMAGE",
            "It is stated in thePur\u0101\u1e47as,\u201cPersons who attempt to visit the holy places of pilgrimage, like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 or Dv\u0101rak\u0101, are actually glorified. By such traveling activities, they can pass over the desert of material existence.\u201d",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayathere is a statement about the benefit of visiting the temples of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As we have explained previously, in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101 the system is that all the devotees take advantage of visiting various temples situated in those holy places. It is stated in theHari-bhakti-sudhodaya,\u201cPersons who are impelled by pure devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and who therefore go to see the Deities of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the temple will surely get relief from entering again into the prison house of a mother\u2019s womb.\u201d The conditioned soul forgets the trouble of living within the mother\u2019s womb during birth, but it is a very painful and terrible experience. In order to make an escape from this material condition, one is advised to visit a temple of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u with devotional consciousness. Then one can very easily get out of the miserable condition of material birth.",
            "CIRCUMAMBULATING THE TEMPLE OF VI\u1e62\u1e46U",
            "It is said in theHari-bhakti-sudhodaya,\u201cA person who is circumambulating the Deity of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can counteract the circumambulation of repeated birth and death in this material world.\u201d The conditioned soul is circumambulating through repeated births and deaths on account of his material existence, and this can be counteracted simply by circumambulating the Deity in the temple.",
            "The C\u0101turm\u0101sya ceremony is observed during the four months of the rainy season in India (approximately July, August, September and October), beginning from \u015ar\u0101va\u1e47a. During these four months, saintly persons who are accustomed to travel from one place to another to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness remain at one place, usually a holy place of pilgrimage. During these times, there are certain special rules and regulations that are strictly followed. It is stated in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athat during this period, if someone circumambulates the temple of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at least four times, it is understood that he has traveled all over the universe. By such circumambulation, one is understood to have seen all the holy places where the Ganges water is flowing, and by following the regulative principles of C\u0101turm\u0101sya one can very quickly be raised to the platform of devotional service.",
            "ARCAN\u0100",
            "Arcan\u0101means worship of the Deity in the temple. By executing this process one confirms himself to be not the body but spirit soul. In the Tenth Canto, eighty-first chapter, verse 19 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,it is told how Sud\u0101m\u0101, an intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, while going to the house of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,murmured to himself, \u201cSimply by worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one can easily achieve all the results of heavenly opulence, liberation, supremacy over the planetary systems of the universe, all the opulences of this material world and the mystic power of performing theyogasystem.\u201d",
            "The events leading to Sud\u0101m\u0101\u2019s murmuring this statement are as follows. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had ordered His friend Sud\u0101m\u0101 to go to abr\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019shouse and ask for some food. Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere performing a great sacrifice, and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Sud\u0101m\u0101 to plead with them that He and Balar\u0101ma were feeling hungry and needed some food. When Sud\u0101m\u0101 went there, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asrefused to offer anything, but the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,upon hearing that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted some foodstuff, immediately took many palatable dishes and went to offer them to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-rahasya,also, it is stated, \u201cAny person within this world who is engaged in the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can very easily achieve the ever-blissful kingdom of God, known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka.\u201d",
            "RENDERING SERVICE TO THE LORD",
            "It is stated in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-rahasya,\u201cAny person who can arrange for service to the Lord in the same way that a king is given service by his attendants is surely elevated to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after death.\u201d Actually, in India the temples are just like royal palaces. They are not ordinary buildings, because the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be performed in just the way that a king is worshiped in his palace. So in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there are many hundreds of temples wherein the Deity is worshiped exactly like a king. In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cIf a person stays in the Lord\u2019s temple even for a few moments, he can surely achieve the transcendental kingdom of God.\u201d",
            "The conclusion is that those who are rich men in society should construct beautiful temples and arrange for the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that people may be attracted to visit such temples and thereby be offered the opportunity of dancing before the Lord or chanting the holy name of the Lord, or else of hearing the holy name of the Lord. In this way, everyone will be given the chance to elevate himself to the kingdom of God. In other words, even a common man, simply by visiting such a temple, will be able to attain the highest benedictions, not to mention the devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In this connection, there is a statement in the Fourth Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 31 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,wherein King P\u1e5bthu says to his subjects, \u201cMy dear citizens, please note that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is actually the deliverer of all fallen, conditioned souls. No demigod can perform this act of delivering the conditioned souls because the demigods themselves are conditioned. A conditioned soul cannot deliver another conditioned soul. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His bona fide representative can deliver him. The Ganges water, which is flowing down from the toe of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, falls upon the earthly planet and other planets and thereby delivers all the conditioned sinful living entities. So what need is there to speak of the deliverance of persons who are always engaged in the service of the Lord? There is no doubt about their liberation, even if they have stocks of sinful activities from many, many births.\u201d In other words, a person who is engaged in the worship of the Deities can minimize his stock of sinful reactions coming from many, many previous births. This process of worshiping the Deity has already been described, and one should try to follow these rules and regulations seriously.",
            "SINGING",
            "In theLi\u1e45ga Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about glorifying and singing about the Lord. It is said there, \u201cAbr\u0101hma\u1e47awho is constantly engaged in singing the glories of the Lord is surely elevated to the same planet as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appreciates this singing even more than the prayers offered by Lord \u015aiva.\u201d",
            "SA\u1e44K\u012aRTANA",
            "When a person loudly chants the glories of the Lord\u2019s activities, qualities, form, etc., his chanting is calledsa\u1e45k\u012brtana. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtanaalso refers to the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord.",
            "In theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmathere is a statement glorifying this process of congregational chanting: \u201cMy dear King, this wordk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ais so auspicious that anyone who chants this holy name immediately gets rid of the resultant actions of sinful activities from many, many births.\u201d That is a fact. There is the following statement inCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta:\u201cA person who chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once can counteract the resultant actions of more sinful activities than he is able to perform.\u201d A sinful man can perform many, many sinful activities, but he is unable to perform so many that they cannot be wiped out by one single uttering ofk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In the Seventh Canto, ninth chapter, verse 18 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da offers the following prayers to the Lord: \u201cMy dear Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, if I can be elevated to the position of Your servant, then it will be possible for me to hear about Your activities. You are the supreme friend, the supreme worshipable Deity. Your pastimes are transcendental, and simply by hearing of them one can counteract all his sinful activities. Therefore, I shall not care for all those sinful activities, because simply by hearing about Your pastimes I shall get out of all the contamination of material attachment.\u201d",
            "There are many songs about the Lord\u2019s activities. For example, there is theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,sung by Lord Brahm\u0101;N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra,sung by N\u0101rada Muni; and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,sung by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. If these songs are heard by any person, he can easily get out of the clutches of material contamination. There should be no difficulty in hearing these songs of God. They are coming down from many, many millions of years ago, and people are still taking advantage of them. So why, at this time, should one not take full advantage and thus become liberated?",
            "In the First Canto, fifth chapter, verse 22 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,N\u0101rada Muni tells his disciple Vy\u0101sadeva, \u201cMy dear Vy\u0101sa, you should know that persons who are engaged in executing austerities and penances, studying theVedas,performing big sacrifices, chanting the hymns of theVedas,speculating on transcendental knowledge and performing charitable functions have for all their auspicious activities simply to gain a place in the association of devotees and chant the glories of the Lord.\u201d It is indicated here that chanting about and glorifying the Lord is the ultimate activity of the living entity.",
            "JAPA",
            "Chanting amantraor hymn softly and slowly is calledjapa,and chanting the samemantraloudly is calledk\u012brtana.For example, uttering themah\u0101-mantra(Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare) very softly, only for one\u2019s own hearing, is calledjapa.Chanting the samemantraloudly for being heard by all others is calledk\u012brtana.Themah\u0101-mantracan be used forjapaandk\u012brtanaalso. Whenjapais practiced it is for the personal benefit of the chanter, but whenk\u012brtanais performed it is for the benefit of all others who may hear.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement: \u201cFor any person who is chanting the holy name either softly or loudly, the paths to liberation and even heavenly happiness are at once open.\u201d",
            "SUBMISSION",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about submission unto the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said there that those who are sober devotees can offer their submission to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the following three ways: (1)sampr\u0101rthan\u0101tmik\u0101,very feelingly offering prayers; (2)dainya-bodhik\u0101,humbly submitting oneself; (3)l\u0101las\u0101-may\u012b,desiring some perfectional stage. This desiring some perfectional stage in spiritual life is not sense gratification. When one realizes something of his constitutional relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he understands his original position and wants to be reinstated in this position, either as friend, servant, parent or conjugal lover of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is calledl\u0101las\u0101-may\u012b,or very eagerly desiring to go to one\u2019s natural position. Thisl\u0101las\u0101-may\u012bstage of submission comes in the stage of perfect liberation, which is technically calledsvar\u016bpa-siddhi,when the living entity understands, by perfect spiritual advancement and revelation, his original relationship with the Lord.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement of submission in feeling by devotees praying to the Lord: \u201cMy Lord, I know that young girls have natural affection for young boys, and that young boys have natural affection for young girls. I am praying at Your lotus feet that my mind may become attracted unto You in the same spontaneous way.\u201d The example is very appropriate. When a young boy or girl sees a member of the opposite sex there is a natural attraction, without the need for any introduction. Without any training there is a natural attraction due to the sex impulse. This is a material example, but the devotee is praying that he may develop a similar spontaneous attachment for the Supreme Lord, free from any desire for profit and without any other cause. This natural attraction for the Lord is the perfectional stage of self-realization.",
            "In the samePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about submission in humbleness. It is stated there, \u201cMy dear Lord, there is no sinful living entity who is more of a sinner than myself. Nor is there a greater offender than myself. I am so greatly sinful and offensive that when I come to confess my sinful activities before You, I am ashamed.\u201d This is a natural position for a devotee. As far as the conditioned soul is concerned, there is no wonder that he has some sinful activities in his past life, and this should be admitted and confessed before the Lord. As soon as this is done, the Lord excuses the sincere devotee. But that does not mean that one should take advantage of the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy and expect to be excused over and over again, while he commits the same sinful activities. Such a mentality is only for shameless persons. Here it is clearly said, \u201cWhen I come to confess my sinful activities I become ashamed.\u201d So if a person is not ashamed of his sinful activities and continues to commit the same sinful activities with the knowledge that the Lord will excuse him, that is a most nonsensical proposition. Such an idea is not accepted in any part of the Vedic literature. It is a fact that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes washed clean of all sinful activities from his past life. But that does not mean that after being washed off, one should again begin sinful activities and expect to be washed again. These are nonsensical propositions and are not admitted in devotional service. Someone may think, \u201cFor a whole week I may commit sinful activities, and for one day I will go to the temple or church and admit my sinful activities so that I can become washed off and again begin my sinning.\u201d This is most nonsensical and offensive and is not acceptable to the author ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.",
            "In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trathere is a statement of submission accompanied by the desire for perfection. The devotee says, \u201cMy dear Lord, when shall that day come when You will ask me to fan Your body, and according to Your pleasure, You will say, \u2018You just fan Me in this way\u2019?\u201d The idea in this verse is that the devotee is desiring to personally fan the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That means that he is desiring to become the personal associate of the Supreme Lord. Of course, any devotee in any capacity, either as servant, friend or conjugal lover, always has direct association with the Lord. But according to his different individual taste, a person desires for just one of these relationships. Here the devotee is desiring to become a servant of the Lord and desires to fan the Lord, as does His internal energy, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune. He also wishes that the Personality of Godhead will be pleased to give him directions as to how to fan. This submission with transcendental desire, orl\u0101las\u0101-may\u012b vij\u00f1apti,is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual realization.",
            "In the sameN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra,there is another expression of submission, wherein the devotee says, \u201cMy dear Lord, O lotus-eyed one, when will that day come when on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 I shall become just like a madman and continue to chant Your holy name while incessant tears flow from my eyes?\u201d This is another perfectional stage. Lord Caitanya also desired that \u201ca moment will appear unto me as twelve years of time, and the whole world will appear to me as vacant on account of not seeing You, my dear Lord.\u201d One should feelingly pray and become eager to render his particular type of service to the Lord. This is the teaching of all great devotees, especially Lord Caitanya.",
            "In other words, one should learn how to cry for the Lord. One should learn this small technique, and he should be very eager and actually cry to become engaged in some particular type of service. This is calledlaulya,and such tears are the price for the highest perfection. If one develops thislaulya,or excessive eagerness for meeting and serving the Lord in a particular way, that is the price to enter into the kingdom of God. Otherwise, there is no material calculation for the value of the ticket by which one can enter the kingdom of God. The only price for such entrance is thislaulya-l\u0101las\u0101-may\u012b,or desire and great eagerness.",
            "RECITING NOTABLE PRAYERS",
            "According to great learned scholars, the wholeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101contains many authorized prayers, especially in the eleventh chapter, where Arjuna prays to the universal form of the Lord. Similarly, in theGautam\u012bya-tantraall the verses are called prayers. Again, in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere are hundreds of prayers to the Lord. So a devotee should select some of these prayers for his recitation. In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athe glories of these prayers are stated as follows: \u201cDevotees whose tongues are decorated always with prayers to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are always given respect even by the great saintly persons and sages, and such devotees are actually worshipable by the demigods.\u201d",
            "Those who are less intelligent want to worship different demigods for some material gain rather than worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But here it is stated that a devotee who is always engaged in offering prayers to the Lord is worshipable even by the demigods themselves. The pure devotees have nothing to ask from any demigod; rather, the demigods are anxious to offer prayers to the pure devotees.",
            "In theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cAny person who comes before the Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and begins to chant different prayers is immediately relieved from all the reactions of sinful activities and becomes eligible, without any doubt, to enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka.\u201d",
            "PARTAKING OF PRAS\u0100DA",
            "There is this specific statement in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a:\u201cA person who honors thepras\u0101daand regularly eats it, not exactly in front of the Deity, along withcara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta[the water offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, which is mixed with seeds of thetulas\u012btree], immediately can achieve the results of the pious activities that are obtained through ten thousand performances of sacrificial rites.\u201d",
            "DRINKING CARA\u1e46\u0100M\u1e5aTA",
            "Cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btais obtained in the morning while the Lord is being washed before dressing. Scented with perfumes and flowers, the water comes gliding down through His lotus feet and is collected and mixed with yogurt. In this way thiscara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btanot only becomes very tastefully flavored, but also has tremendous spiritual value. As described in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,even a person who has never been able to give in charity, who has never been able to perform a great sacrifice, who has never been able to study theVedas,who has never been able to worship the Lord\u00a0\u2013 or, in other words, even one who has never done any pious activities\u00a0\u2013 will become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God if he simply drinks thecara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btathat is kept in the temple. In the temple it is the custom that thecara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btabe kept in a big pot. The devotees who come to visit and offer respects to the Deity take three drops ofcara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btavery submissively and feel themselves happy in transcendental bliss.",
            "SMELLING THE INCENSE OR FLOWERS OFFERED TO THE DEITY",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayathere is a statement about the incense which is offered in the temple: \u201cWhen the devotees smell the good flavor of the incense which is offered to the Deity, they thus become cured of the poisonous effects of material contamination, as much as one becomes cured of a snakebite by smelling the prescribed medicinal herbs.\u201d The explanation of this verse is that there is an herb found in the jungles that expert persons know how to use to revive the consciousness of one who is bitten by a snake. Simply by smelling that herb one becomes immediately relieved of the poisonous effects of the snakebite. The same example is applicable: When a person comes to visit the temple and smells the incense offered to the Deity, he is cured at that time from all his material contamination.",
            "Any devotee coming into the temple should always offer something to the Deity\u00a0\u2013 fruit, flowers, incense, etc. If one cannot offer anything in cash, something else must be offered. In India the system is that all the ladies and gentlemen who come in the morning to visit the temple bring so many things. Even one morsel of rice or one morsel of flour can be offered. It is a regulative principle that one should not go to see a saintly person or the Deity in the temple without any offering. The offering may be very humble, or it may be priceless. Even a flower, a little fruit, a little water\u00a0\u2013 whatever is possible\u00a0\u2013 must be offered. So when a devotee comes to offer something to the Deity in the morning, he is sure to smell the good flavor of the incense, and then at once he will become cleansed of the poisonous effect of material existence.",
            "It is stated in theTantra-\u015b\u0101stra,\u201cIf the smell of the garland that was offered to the Deity in the temple enters into a person\u2019s nostrils, immediately his bondage to sinful activities becomes cleared. And even if one has no sinful activities, still, by smelling such remnants of flowers, one can advance from M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b [impersonalist] to devotee.\u201d There are several instances of this, a prime one being the advancement of the four Kum\u0101ras. They were impersonalist M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, but after smelling the remnants of flowers and incense in the temple, they turned to become devotees. From the above verse it appears that the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, or impersonalists, are more or less contaminated. They are not pure.",
            "It is confirmed in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u201cOne who has not washed off all reactions of sinful activities cannot be a pure devotee. A pure devotee has no more doubts about the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead, and thus he engages himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service.\u201d A similar statement is in theAgastya-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:Just to purify the impurities of our nostrils, we should try to smell the remnants of flowers offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the temple.",
            "TOUCHING THE DEITY",
            "In theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmottarathere is a statement about touching the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said, \u201cOnly a person who is initiated as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and is executing devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has the right to touch the body of the Deity.\u201d In India there was agitation during Gandhi\u2019s political movement because the lowborn classes of men like street-sweepers andca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101lasare prohibited, according to the Vedic system, from entering the temple. Due to their unclean habits they are prohibited, but at the same time they are given other facilities so they may be elevated to the highest grade of devotional service by association with pure devotees. A man born in any family is not barred, but he must be cleansed. That cleansing process must be adopted. Gandhi wanted to make them clean simply by stamping them with a fictitious name,hari-jana(\u201cchildren of God\u201d), and so there was a great tug-of-war between the temple owners and Gandhi\u2019s followers.",
            "But anyway, the present law is the law of all scripture\u00a0\u2013 that if anyone is purified he can enter into the temple. Actually, that is the position. Only one who is properly initiated, who is properly following the rules and regulations, can enter and touch the Deity\u00a0\u2013 not all. And one who touches the body of the Deity, following such regulative principles, is immediately delivered from the contamination of material sins, and all of his desires become fulfilled without delay.",
            "SEEING THE DEITY",
            "In theVar\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement praising the seeing of the Deity of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the temple. A devotee says there, \u201cMy dear Vasundhar\u0101, any person who goes to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and sees the Deity of Govinda-deva is free from the courthouse of Yamar\u0101ja and is allowed to enter into the highest planetary system, in which reside the demigods.\u201d This means that even an ordinary person who goes to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana out of inquisitiveness and by chance sees the temple, especially that of Govinda-deva, even if he is not elevated to the spiritual kingdom, is still assured promotion to the higher planetary systems. This means that simply by visiting the Deity of Govinda in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana one becomes highly elevated in pious life.",
            "OBSERVING \u0100RATI AND CELEBRATIONS OF THE LORD",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is the following description of the result of seeing\u0101rati(worship) of the Deity: \u201cIf someone sees the face of the Lord while\u0101ratiis going on, he can be relieved of all sinful reactions coming from many, many thousands and millions of years past. He is even excused from the killing of abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor similar prohibited activities.\u201d",
            "As we have already explained, there are different ceremonies to be observed, such as the birthday of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the birthday of Lord R\u0101macandra, the birthday of some prominent Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the ceremony of Jhulana-y\u0101tr\u0101 with the Lord sitting on a swing, and Dola-y\u0101tr\u0101 (the Lord\u2019s activities in the month of March). In all festivals the Lord is seated on a car, and the car moves through different streets of the city so that people may take advantage of visiting the Lord. In theBhavi\u1e63ya Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said, \u201cIn such a ceremony, if even aca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la[dog-eater], simply out of curiosity, sees the Lord on the cart, he becomes counted as one of the associates of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d",
            "In theAgni Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cAny person who in gladness sees the worship of the Deity in the temple will obtain the results ofkriy\u0101-yoga,which are described in thePa\u00f1car\u0101trascripture.\u201dKriy\u0101-yogais a system of practice much like practical devotional service, but it is especially meant for the mysticyog\u012bs.In other words, by this gradual process the mysticyog\u012bsare eventually elevated to the devotional service of the Lord."

            "HEARING",
            "The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service is hearing, in Sanskrit called\u015brava\u1e47am.All people should be given the chance to come and join devotional parties so that they may hear. This hearing is very important for progressing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who links his ears to the transcendental vibrations through aural reception quickly becomes purified and cleansed in the heart. Lord Caitanya has affirmed that this hearing is very important. It cleanses the heart of the contaminated soul so that he becomes quickly qualified to enter into devotional service and understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In theGaru\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47athe stress on hearing is expressed very nicely. It is said there, \u201cThe state of conditioned life in the material world is just like that of a man lying unconscious, having been bitten by a snake. This is because both such unconscious states can be ended by the sound of amantra.\u201d When a man is snake-bitten he does not die immediately but first becomes unconscious and remains in a comatose condition. Anyone who is in the material world is also sleeping, as he is ignorant of his actual self or his actual duty and his relationship with God. So materialistic life means that one is bitten by the snake ofm\u0101y\u0101,illusion, and thus, without any K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is almost dead. Now, the so-called dead man bitten by a snake can be brought back to life by the chanting of somemantra.There are expert chanters of thesemantraswho can perform this feat. Similarly, one can be brought back into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the deadly unconscious state of material life by hearing of themah\u0101-mantra:Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.",
            "In the Fourth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twenty-ninth chapter, verse 40, the importance of hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is stated by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it: \u201cMy dear King, one should stay at a place where the great\u0101c\u0101ryas[holy teachers] speak about the transcendental activities of the Lord, and one should give aural reception to the nectarean river flowing from the moonlike faces of such great personalities. If someone eagerly continues to hear such transcendental sounds, then certainly he will become freed from all material hunger, thirst, fear and lamentation, as well as all illusions of material existence.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also recommended this process of hearing as a means of self-realization in the present age of Kali. In this age it is very difficult to follow thoroughly the regulative principles and studies of theVedaswhich were formerly recommended. However, if one gives aural reception to the sound vibrated by great devotees and\u0101c\u0101ryas,that alone will give him relief from all material contamination. Therefore it is the recommendation of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu that one should simply hear from authorities who are actually devotees of the Lord. Hearing from professional men will not help. If we hear from those who are actually self-realized, then the nectarean rivers, like those which are flowing on the moon planet, will flow into our ears. This is the metaphor used in the above verse.",
            "As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u201cA materialistic person can give up his material hankerings only by becoming situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d Unless one finds a superior engagement, he will not be able to give up his inferior engagement. In the material world everyone is engaged in the illusory activities of the inferior energy, but when one is given the opportunity to relish the activities of the superior energy performed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he forgets all his lesser pleasures. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, to the materialistic person it appears that this is simply talk between two friends, but actually it is a river of nectar flowing down from the mouth of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna gave aural reception to such vibrations, and thus he became freed from all the illusions of material problems.",
            "In the Twelfth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,third chapter, verse 15, it is stated, \u201cA person who desires unalloyed devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is praised by transcendental sound vibrations, should always hear about His glorification and transcendental qualities. This will surely kill all kinds of inauspiciousness in the heart.\u201d",
            "EXPECTING THE LORD\u2019S MERCY",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 8, it is said, \u201cMy dear Lord, any person who is constantly awaiting Your causeless mercy to be bestowed upon him, and who goes on suffering the resultant actions of his past misdeeds, offering You respectful obeisances from the core of his heart, is surely eligible to become liberated, for it has become his rightful claim.\u201d",
            "This statement of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamshould be the guide of all devotees. A devotee should not expect immediate relief from the reactions of his past misdeeds. No conditioned soul is free from such reactionary experiences, because material existence means continued suffering or enjoying of past activities. If one has finished his material activities then there is no more birth. This is possible only when one begins K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, because such activities do not produce reaction. Therefore, as soon as one becomes perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, he is not going to take birth again in this material world. A devotee who is not perfectly freed from the resultant actions should therefore continue to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness seriously, even though there may be so many impediments. When such impediments arise he should simply think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and expect His mercy. That is the only solace. If the devotee passes his days in that spirit, it is certain that he is going to be promoted to the abode of the Lord. By such activities, he earns his claim to enter into the kingdom of God. The exact word used in this verse isd\u0101ya-bh\u0101k. D\u0101ya-bh\u0101krefers to a son\u2019s becoming the lawful inheritor of the property of the father. In a similar way, a pure devotee who is prepared to undergo all kinds of tribulations in executing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious duties becomes lawfully qualified to enter into the transcendental abode.",
            "REMEMBRANCE",
            "Some way or other, if someone establishes in his mind his continuous relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, this relationship is called remembrance. About this remembrance there is a nice statement in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a,where it is said, \u201cSimply by remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead all living entities become eligible for all kinds of auspiciousness. Therefore let me always remember the Lord, who is unborn and eternal.\u201d In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athe same remembrance is explained as follows: \u201cLet me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because if someone remembers Him, either at the time of death or during his span of life, he becomes freed from all sinful reactions.\u201d",
            "MEDITATION",
            "To meditate means to engage the mind in thinking of the form of the Lord, the qualities of the Lord, the activities of the Lord and the service of the Lord. Meditation does not mean anything impersonal or void. According to Vedic literature, meditation is always on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
            "In theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about meditation on the form of the Lord. It is said there, \u201cMeditation focusing on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been accepted as transcendental and beyond the experience of material pain and pleasure. By such meditation, even one who is grossly miscreant can be delivered from the sinful reactions of his life.\u201d",
            "In theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmathere is a statement about meditation on the transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said, \u201cPersons who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and who remember the transcendental qualities of the Lord, become free from all reactions to sinful activities, and after being so cleansed they become fit to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d In other words, no one can enter into the kingdom of God without being freed from all sinful reactions. One can avoid sinful reactions simply by remembering the Lord\u2019s form, qualities, pastimes, etc.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about remembering the activities of the Lord: \u201cA person who is always engaged in meditation on the sweet pastimes and wonderful activities of the Lord surely becomes freed from all material contamination.\u201d",
            "In some of thePur\u0101\u1e47asthe evidence is given that if someone is simply meditating on devotional activities, he has achieved the desired result and has seen face to face the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this connection, there is a story in theBrahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47athat in the city of Prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na-pura in South India there was once abr\u0101hma\u1e47awho was not very well-to-do, but who was nevertheless satisfied in himself, thinking that it was because of his past misdeeds and by the desire of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he did not get sufficient money and opulence. So he was not at all sorry for his poor material position, and he used to live very peacefully. He was very openhearted, and sometimes he went to hear some lectures delivered by great realized souls. At one such meeting, while he was very faithfully hearing about Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava activities, he was informed that these activities can be performed even by meditation. In other words, if a person is unable to actually perform Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava activities physically, he can meditate upon the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava activities and thereby acquire all of the same results. Because thebr\u0101hma\u1e47awas not very well-to-do financially, he decided that he would simply meditate on grand, royal devotional activities, and he began this business thus:",
            "Sometimes he would take his bath in the River God\u0101var\u012b. After taking his bath he would sit in a secluded place on the bank of the river, and by practicing theyogaexercises ofpr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma,the usual breathing exercises, he would concentrate his mind. These breathing exercises are meant to mechanically fix the mind upon a particular subject. That is the result of the breathing exercises and also of the different sitting postures ofyoga.Formerly, even quite ordinary persons used to know how to fix the mind upon the remembrance of the Lord, and so thebr\u0101hma\u1e47awas doing this. When he had fixed the form of the Lord in his mind, he began to imagine in his meditations that he was dressing the Lord very nicely in costly clothing, with ornaments, helmets and other paraphernalia. Then he offered his respectful obeisances by bowing down before the Lord. After finishing the dressing, he began to imagine that he was cleaning the temple very nicely. After cleansing the temple, he imagined that he had many water jugs made of gold and silver, and he took all those jugs to the river and filled them with the holy water. Not only did he collect water from the God\u0101var\u012b, but he collected from the Ganges, Yamun\u0101, Narmad\u0101 and K\u0101ver\u012b. Generally a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, while worshiping the Lord, collects water from all these rivers bymantrachanting. Thisbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,instead of chanting somemantra,imagined that he was physically securing water from all these rivers in golden and silver water pots. Then he collected all kinds of paraphernalia for worship\u00a0\u2013 flowers, fruits, incense and sandalwood pulp. He collected everything to place before the Deity. All these waters, flowers and scented articles were then very nicely offered to the Deities to Their satisfaction. Then he offered\u0101rati,and with the regulative principles he finished all these activities in the correct worshiping method.",
            "He would daily execute similar performances as his routine work, and he continued to do so for many, many years. Then one day thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aimagined in his meditations that he had prepared some sweet rice with milk and sugar and offered the preparation to the Deity. However, he was not very satisfied with the offering because the sweet rice had been prepared recently and it was still very hot. (This preparation, sweet rice, should not be taken hot. The cooler the sweet rice, the better its taste.) So because the sweet rice had been prepared by thebr\u0101hma\u1e47avery recently, he wanted to touch it so that he could know whether it was fit for eating by the Lord. As soon as he touched the sweet rice pot with his finger, he immediately was burnt by the heat of the pot. In this way, his meditation broke. Now, when he looked at his finger, he saw that it was burnt, and he was wondering in astonishment how this could have happened. Because he was simply meditating on touching the hot sweet rice, he never thought that his finger would actually become burnt.",
            "While he was thinking like this, in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, seated with the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, began to smile humorously. On seeing this smiling of the Lord, all the goddesses of fortune attending the Lord became very curious and asked Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a why He was smiling. The Lord, however, did not reply to their inquisitiveness, but instead immediately sent for thebr\u0101hma\u1e47a.An airplane sent from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha immediately brought thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ainto Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s presence. When thebr\u0101hma\u1e47awas thus present before the Lord and the goddesses of fortune, the Lord explained the whole story. Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47awas then fortunate enough to get an eternal place in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha in the association of the Lord and His Lak\u1e63m\u012bs. This shows how the Lord is all-pervading, in spite of His being locally situated in His abode. Although the Lord was present in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, He was present also in the heart of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47awhen he was meditating on the worshiping process. Thus, we can understand that things offered by the devotees even in meditation are accepted by the Lord, and they help one achieve the desired result."

            "Aspects of Transcendental Service",
            "SERVITORSHIP",
            "In the opinion of thekarm\u012bs(fruitive workers), offering the results ofkarmais called servitorship. But according to Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u0101c\u0101ryaslike R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, servitorship means constant engagement in some kind of service to the Lord.",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said that those who are attached to ritualistic activities, the four orders of social life and the four orders of spiritual life, are considered devotees. But when devotees are actually engaged in offering service to the Lord directly, these must bebh\u0101gavatas,or pure devotees. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities, or prescribed duties according to the four orders of social and spiritual life, are not actually pure devotees. But still, because they are offering the result to the Lord, they are accepted as devotees. When one has no such desire but acts spontaneously out of love of God, such a person must be accepted as a pure devotee. The conditioned souls who have come into contact with the material world are all more or less desirous of lording it over material nature. The system ofvar\u1e47\u0101\u015bramaand the prescribed duties under this system are so designed that the conditioned soul may enjoy in the material world according to his desire for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become elevated to spiritual understanding. Under these prescribed duties ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramathere are many activities which belong to devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those devotees who are householders accept Vedic ritualistic performances as well as the prescribed duties of devotional service, because both are meant for satisfying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When householder devotees perform some Vedic ritualistic duties, they do so to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As we have previously discussed, any activity aiming at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead is considered devotional service.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes one who is fit for becoming engaged in devotional service. He says that persons who are neophytes and who have developed a little love of Godhead are not interested in the activities of sense gratification, in proportion to their devotion. But if there is still some attraction for sense gratifying activities, then the result of such activities should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is also called engagement in the service of the Lord, with the Lord as the master and the worker as the servant.",
            "In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement of how this servitorship is transcendental. It is said there that a person who is constantly engaged in devotional service by his body, mind and words, or even a person who is not practically engaged but is simply desiring to be so, is considered to be liberated.",
            "DEVOTIONAL SERVICE IN FRIENDSHIP",
            "Devotional service in friendship can be divided into two categories: the first is to act as the confidential servant of the Lord, and the other is to act as the well-wisher of the Lord. The devotee who has confidence in devotional service to the Lord systematically follows the rules and regulations, with the faith that he will achieve the platform of transcendental life. The second type of devotional friendship is to become a well-wisher of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is said that the Lord accepts a preacher as the most dear servant. Anyone who is preaching the confidential message of theG\u012bt\u0101to the people in general is so dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that no one can be equal to him in human society.",
            "In theMah\u0101bh\u0101rata,Draupad\u012b says, \u201cMy dear Govinda, Your promise is that Your devotee can never be vanquished. I believe in that statement, and therefore in all kinds of tribulations I simply remember Your promise, and thus I live.\u201d The purport is that Draupad\u012b and her five husbands, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, were put into severe tribulations by their cousin-brother Duryodhana as well as by others. The tribulations were so severe that even Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, who was both a lifelongbrahmac\u0101r\u012band a great warrior, would sometimes shed tears thinking of them. He was always surprised that although the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were so righteous and Draupad\u012b was practically the goddess of fortune, and although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was their friend, still they had to undergo such severe tribulations. Though their tribulations were not ordinary, Draupad\u012b was not discouraged. She knew that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was their friend, ultimately they would be saved.",
            "A similar statement is there in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,second chapter, verse 53, where Havis, the son of King \u1e5a\u1e63abha, addresses Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi: \u201cMy dear King, a person who never deviates even for a moment from engagement in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Person (engagement which is sought even by great demigods like Indra), with firm conviction that there is nothing more worshipable or desirable than this, is called the first-class devotee.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that a neophyte devotee who has simply developed a slight love of Godhead is certainly a prospective candidate for devotional service. When he becomes firmly fixed in such devotional service, that assured status becomes a confidential part of his devotional service.",
            "Sometimes it is found that a pure devotee lies down in the temple of the Lord in order to serve Him as a confidential friend. Such friendly behavior of a devotee may be accepted asr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101,or spontaneous. Although, according to regulative principles, no one can lie down in the temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this spontaneous love of Godhead may be grouped under devotional service in friendship.",
            "SURRENDERING EVERYTHING TO THE LORD",
            "Regarding complete self-surrender, there is a nice description in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twenty-ninth chapter, verse 34, where the Lord says, \u201cA person who has completely surrendered unto Me and has completely given up all other activities is protected by Me personally, both in this life and in the next. In other words, I wish to help him become more and more advanced in spiritual life. Such a person is to be understood as having already achieveds\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di[having equal opulences with the Supreme].\u201d It is also confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that as soon as a person surrenders unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes charge of him and gives him a guarantee of protection from all sinful reactions. He also instructs from within so that the devotee may very quickly make advancement toward spiritual perfection.",
            "This self-surrender is called\u0101tma-nivedana.According to different authorities,selfis differently defined.Selfis sometimes considered to refer to the spirit self, or soul, andselfis sometimes considered to refer to the mind or to the body. Full self-surrender, therefore, means not only surrendering one\u2019s self as spirit soul, but also surrendering one\u2019s mind and body to the service of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung a nice song in this connection. While offering himself as a fully surrendered soul, he said, \u201cMy mind, my household affairs, my body, whatever is in my possession, my dear Lord, I offer to You for Your service. Now You can do with them as You like. You are the supreme possessor of everything, so if You like You can kill me, or if You like You can give me protection. All authority belongs to You. I have nothing to claim as my own.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, in his prayers to the Lord, has expressed a similar idea in the following words: \u201cMy dear Lord, I may be living within some body as a human being or as a demigod, but whatever mode of life, I do not mind, because these bodies are simply by-products of the three modes of material nature, and I, who am in possession of these bodies, am surrendering myself unto You.\u201d",
            "In theHari-bhakti-viveka,there is a statement regarding how one can offer his body in self-surrender. There the devotee says, \u201cMy dear Lord, as a sold animal has no need to think about his maintenance and sustenance, so, because I have given up my body and soul unto You, I am no longer concerned with my maintenance and sustenance.\u201d In other words, one should not bother about his personal or family maintenance or sustenance. If one is actually surrendered in body and soul, he should always remember that his only concern is to be engaged in the service of the Lord.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that devotional service in friendship and devotional service in self-surrender are two difficult processes. Therefore such relationships with the Lord can very rarely be seen. Only for the advanced devotees are these two processes easily executed. The purport is that it is very rare to see surrender that is mixed with sincere ecstatic devotion. One must give himself completely to the will of the Lord.",
            "OFFERING A FAVORITE ARTICLE",
            "In the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eleventh chapter, verse 41, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Uddhava, \u201cMy dear friend, if someone offers Me the best thing in his possession, or anything which is very pleasing to him, he will be eternally benefited.\u201d",
            "PERFORMING ALL ENDEAVORS FOR K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A",
            "In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trathere is a statement of how one can act in all spheres of life for the satisfaction of the Lord. It is stated there that a person who is actually in devotional service must be engaged in all kinds of activities\u00a0\u2013 those prescribed in the revealed scriptures and also those that are accepted for livelihood. In other words, not only should a devotee engage himself in the prescribed duties of devotional service that are mentioned in the revealed scriptures, but he should also perform the duties of his practical life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, a devotee who has a great establishment or factory may offer the fruits of such a material possession for the service of the Lord.",
            "BEING A SURRENDERED SOUL",
            "In theHari-bhakti-vil\u0101sathere is the following statement about self-surrender: \u201cMy dear Lord, a person who has surrendered himself unto You, who is in firm conviction that he is Yours, and who actually acts in that way by his body, mind and words, can actually relish transcendental bliss.\u201d",
            "In theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a,Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva says, \u201cAnyone who prays unto Me and takes shelter from Me becomes My ward, and I protect him always from all sorts of calamities.\u201d",
            "SERVING TREES SUCH AS THE TULAS\u012a",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement praising thetulas\u012btree as follows: \u201cLet me offer my respectful obeisances unto thetulas\u012btree, which can immediately vanquish volumes of sinful activities. Simply by seeing or touching this tree one can become relieved from all distresses and diseases. Simply by offering obeisances to and pouring water on thetulas\u012btree, one can become freed from the fear of being sent to the court of Yamar\u0101ja [the king of death, who punishes the sinful]. If someone sows atulas\u012btree somewhere, certainly he becomes devoted to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And when thetulas\u012bleaves are offered in devotion at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is the full development of love of Godhead.\u201d",
            "In India all Hindus, even those not belonging to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava group, take special care of thetulas\u012btree. Even in great cities where it is very difficult to keep atulas\u012btree, people are to be found very carefully keeping this plant. They water it and offer obeisances to it, because worship of thetulas\u012btree is very important in devotional service.",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is another statement abouttulas\u012bas follows: \u201cTulas\u012bis auspicious in all respects. Simply by seeing, simply by touching, simply by remembering, simply by praying to, simply by bowing before, simply by hearing about or simply by sowing this tree, there is always auspiciousness. Anyone who comes in touch with thetulas\u012btree in the above-mentioned ways lives eternally in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world.\u201d"

            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,there is a nice statement praising the service of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or devotees. In that scripture Lord \u015aiva tells P\u0101rvat\u012b, \u201cMy dear P\u0101rvat\u012b, there are different methods of worship, and out of all such methods the worship of the Supreme Person is considered to be the highest.

The normal condition of every living entity is to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. From the statement of the\u0100di Pur\u0101\u1e47ait appears that a devotee is satisfied simply with being engaged in devotional service.

In other words, those who are attached to\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamdo not care for any kind of benefit derived from elevation to the higher planetary kingdoms, or for the liberation which is conceived of by the impersonalists.

It acts just like a crystal stone, which will reflect anything which is put before it.\u201d Similarly, if we associate with the flowerlike devotees of the Lord, and if our hearts are crystal clear, then certainly the same action will be there. Another example given in this connection is that if a man is potent and if a woman is not diseased, then by their conjugation there will be conception. In the same way, if the recipient of spiritual knowledge and the deliverer of spiritual knowledge are sincere and bona fide, there will be good results.",

So \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b especially stresses that it has already been concluded that one who has come to the stage of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantrawith determination and steadiness must be considered to have already passed the trials of fruitive activities, mental speculation and mysticyoga.",

The holy name is not a material sound vibration, nor has it any material contamination.\u201d The holy name cannot, therefore, be chanted offenselessly by one who has failed to purify his senses. In other words, materialistic senses cannot properly chant the holy names of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra.But by adopting this chanting process, one is given a chance to actually purify himself, so that he may very soon chant offenselessly.",

For persons who are not inclined to clean the dust from their hearts and who want to keep things as they are, it is not possible to derive the transcendental result of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.One should, therefore, be encouraged to develop his service attitude toward the Lord, because this will help him to chant without any offense. And so, under the guidance of a spiritual master, the disciple is trained to render service and at the same time chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.As soon as one develops his spontaneous service attitude, he can immediately understand the transcendental nature of the holy names of themah\u0101-mantra.",

            "Regarding worship of the form of the Lord, or Deity, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has written the following verse: \u201cMy dear friend, if you still have any desire to enjoy the company of your friends within this material world, then don\u2019t look upon the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is standing on the bank of Ke\u015b\u012b-gh\u0101\u1e6da [a bathing place in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana]. He is known as Govinda, and His eyes are very enchanting. He is playing upon His flute, and on His head there is a peacock feather. And His whole body is illuminated by the moonlight in the sky.\u201d",
            "The purport of this verse is that if someone becomes attached to the\u015br\u012b-m\u016brti,or Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by worshiping at home, then he will forget his relationships of so-called friendship, love and society. Thus it is the duty of every householder to install Deities of the Lord at home and to begin the process of worshiping along with all of his family members. This will save everyone from such unwanted activities as going to clubs, cinemas and dancing parties, and smoking, drinking, etc. All such nonsense will be forgotten if one stresses the worship of the Deities at home.",
            "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b further writes, \u201cMy dear foolish friend, I think that you have already heard some of the auspicious\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,which decries seeking the results of fruitive activities, economic development and liberation. I think that now it is certain that gradually the verses of the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,describing the pastimes of the Lord, will enter your ears and go into your heart.\u201d",
            "In the beginning of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that unless one has the ability to throw out, just like garbage, the fruitive results of ritualistic ceremonies, economic development and becoming one with the Supreme (or salvation), one cannot understand\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.TheBh\u0101gavatamdeals exclusively with devotional service. Only one who studies\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin the spirit of renunciation can understand the pastimes of the Lord that are described in the Tenth Canto. In other words, one should not try to understand the topics of the Tenth Canto, such as ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101(love dance), unless he has spontaneous attraction for\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.One must be situated in pure devotional service before he can relish\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamas it is.",
            "In the above two verses of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b there are some metaphorical analogies that indirectly condemn the association of materialistic society, friendship and love. People are generally attracted to society, friendship and love, and they make elaborate arrangements and strong endeavors to develop these material contaminations. But to see the\u015br\u012b-m\u016brtisof R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to forget such endeavors for material association. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b composed his verse in such a way that he was seemingly praising the material association of friendship and love and was condemning the audience of\u015br\u012b-m\u016brtior Govinda. This metaphorical analogy is constructed in such a way that things that seem to be praised are condemned, and things that are to be condemned are praised. The actual import of the verse is that one must see the form of Govinda if one at all wants to forget the nonsense of material friendship, love and society.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has similarly described the transcendental nature of relishing topics that concern K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A devotee once said, \u201cIt is very astonishing that since I have seen this Personality of Godhead, who is washed by the tears of my eyes, there is shivering of my body and He has made me a failure in executing my material duties. Since seeing Him, I cannot remain silently at home. I wish to go out to Him always.\u201d The purport of this statement is that as soon as one is fortunate enough to contact a pure devotee, one must be anxious immediately to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to learn about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or, in other words, to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
            "Similarly, there is a statement about hearing and chanting themah\u0101-mantra:\u201cIt is said that saints have been able to hear the vibrating strings of thev\u012b\u1e47\u0101in the hands of N\u0101rada, who is always singing the glories of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Now this same sound vibration has entered my ears, and I am always feeling the presence of the Supreme Personality. Gradually I am becoming bereft of all attachment for material enjoyment.\u201d",
            "Again, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described Mathur\u0101-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala: \u201cI remember the Lord standing by the banks of the Yamun\u0101 River, so beautiful amid thekadambatrees, where many birds are chirping in the gardens. And these impressions are always giving me transcendental realization of beauty and bliss.\u201d This feeling about Mathur\u0101-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b can actually be felt even by nondevotees. The places in the eighty-four-square-mile district of Mathur\u0101 are so beautifully situated on the banks of the river Yamun\u0101 that anyone who goes there will never want to return to this material world. These statements by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b are factually realized descriptions of Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. All these qualities prove that Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are situated transcendentally. Otherwise, there would be no possibility of invoking our transcendental sentiments in these places. Such transcendental feelings are aroused immediately and without fail after one arrives in Mathur\u0101 or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "In these statements about devotional service, sometimes it may appear that the results have been overestimated, but actually there is no overestimation. Some devotees, as revealed scriptures give evidence, have had immediate results by such association, although this is not possible for all. For example, the Kum\u0101ras immediately became devotees simply by smelling the incense in the temple. Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura simply heard about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then immediately gave up his beautiful girlfriend and started out for Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where he became a perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. So these statements are not overestimations, nor are they stories. They are actual facts, but are true for certain devotees and do not necessarily apply to all. These descriptions, even if considered overestimations, must be taken as they are in order to divert our attention from the fleeting material beauty to the eternal beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And for a person who is already in contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the described results are not unusual.",
            "Some scholars argue that simply by following the principles ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramaone can gradually rise to the perfections reached by practicing devotional service, but this argument is not accepted by the great authorities. Lord Caitanya also condemned this idea while He was talking with R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya about the gradual development of devotional service. He rejected the idea of the importance ofvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharmawhen it was put forward by R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya. He said that this advancement ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramais merely external. There is a higher principle. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101also the Lord says that one has to give up all other principles of elevation and take simply to the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will help one in achieving the highest perfection of life.",
            "In the Eleventh Canto, twentieth chapter, verse 9 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,the Lord Himself says, \u201cOne should execute the prescribed duties ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramaas long as he has not developed spontaneous attachment for hearing about My pastimes and activities.\u201d In other words, the prescribed forms ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramaare ritualistic ceremonies of religion intended for economic development, sense gratification or salvation. All of these things are recommended for persons who have not developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; in fact, all such activities are recommended in the revealed scriptures only to bring one to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But one who has already developed spontaneous attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not require to execute the duties prescribed in the scriptures."

            "CHAPTER FOURTEEN",
            "Devotional Qualifications",
            "Some scholars recommend that knowledge and renunciation are important factors for elevating oneself to devotional service. But actually that is not a fact. Actually, the cultivation of knowledge or renunciation, which are favorable for achieving a footing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, may be accepted in the beginning, but ultimately they may also come to be rejected, for devotional service is dependent on nothing other than the sentiment or desire for such service. It requires nothing more than sincerity.",
            "It is the opinion of expert devotees that mental speculation and the artificial austerities ofyogapractice may be favorable for becoming liberated from material contamination, but they will also make one\u2019s heart harder and harder. They will not help at all in the progress of devotional service. These processes are therefore not favorable for entering into the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Actually, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u00a0\u2013 devotional service itself\u00a0\u2013 is the only way of advancing in devotional life. Devotional service is absolute; it is both the cause and the effect. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause and effect of all that be, and to approach Him, the Absolute, the process of devotional service\u00a0\u2013 which is also absolute\u00a0\u2013 has to be adopted.",
            "This is confirmed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101by the Lord Himself: \u201cOne can understand Me only through devotional service.\u201d In beginning His teaching of theG\u012bt\u0101the Lord said to Arjuna, \u201cBecause you are My devotee, I shall teach these secrets to you.\u201d Vedic knowledge means ultimately to understand the Supreme Lord, and the process of entering into His kingdom is devotional service. That is accepted by all authentic scriptures. Mental speculators neglect the process of devotional service, and by simply trying to defeat others in philosophical research they fail to develop the ecstasy of devotion.",
            "In the Eleventh Canto, twentieth chapter, verse 31 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, for persons who are seriously engaged in My service, the cultivation of philosophical speculation and artificial renunciation are not very favorable. When a person becomes My devotee he automatically attains the fruits of the renunciation of material enjoyment, and he gets sufficient knowledge to understand the Absolute Truth.\u201d That is the test of advancement in devotional service. A devotee cannot be in darkness, because the Lord shows him special favor and enlightens him from within.",
            "In the Eleventh Canto, twentieth chapter, verses 32 and 33 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthe Lord further instructs Uddhava, \u201cMy dear friend, the profits derived from fruitive activities, austerities, the culture of philosophical knowledge, renunciation, the practice of mysticyoga,charity and all similar auspicious activities are automatically achieved by My devotees\u00a0\u2013 those who are simply attached to Me by loving service. These devotees have everything at their disposal, but they desire nothing outside of My devotional service. If ever a devotee should desire some material profit, like promotion to the heavenly planets, or some spiritual profit\u00a0\u2013 to go to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas\u00a0\u2013 by My causeless mercy his desires are very easily fulfilled.\u201d",
            "Actually, a person who is developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and still has some attachment to material enjoyment will soon be freed from such a tendency by regularly discharging devotional service under the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, then, recommends that one should not be attached to material sense enjoyment but should accept everything enjoyable that is in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, eating is necessary, and one wants some palatable dishes to satisfy his sense of taste. So in that case, for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rather than for the satisfaction of the tongue, some palatable dishes may be prepared and offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then it is renunciation. Let the palatable dishes be prepared, but unless they are offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one should not accept them for eating. This vow of rejecting anything that is not offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually renunciation. And by such renunciation one is able to satisfy the demands of the senses.",
            "The impersonalists, who try to avoid everything material, may undergo severe austerities, but they miss the opportunity of being engaged in the service of the Lord. Thus their renunciation is not sufficient for perfection. There are many instances where, following such artificial renunciation without any contact with devotional service, the impersonalist again fell down and became attracted to material contamination. There are many supposed renouncers even at the present moment who officially becomesanny\u0101s\u012bs,or renouncers, and outwardly claim that spiritual existence is truth and material existence untruth. In this way, artificially they make a show of renunciation of the material world. However, because they cannot reach the point of devotional service, they fail to achieve the goal, and they again come back to material activities, such as philanthropic work and political agitation. There are many examples of so-calledsanny\u0101s\u012bswho gave up the world as untruth but again came to the material world because they were not seeking their real repose at the lotus feet of the Lord.",
            "One should not give up anything that can be utilized in the service of the Lord. That is a secret of devotional service. Anything that can be utilized in advancing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service should be accepted. For instance, we are using many machines for the advancement of our present K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, machines like typewriters, dictating machines, tape recorders, microphones and airplanes. Sometimes people ask us, \u201cWhy are you utilizing material products if you condemn the advancement of material civilization?\u201d But actually we do not condemn. We simply ask people to do whatever they are doing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the same principle on which, inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna to utilize his fighting abilities in devotional service. Similarly, we are utilizing these machines for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. With such sentiment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we can accept everything. If the typewriter can be utilized for advancing our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we must accept it. Similarly, the dictating machine or any other machine must be used. Our vision is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause and effect, and nothing belongs to us. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s things must be used in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is our vision.",
            "This does not mean, however, that we should give up the principles of discharging devotional service or neglect abiding by the rules and regulations prescribed therein. In the neophyte stage of devotion one must follow all the principles, regulated by the authority of the spiritual master. The acceptance and rejection of things should always be in pursuance of the devotional principles; not that one can independently manufacture some idea of what should be accepted or rejected. The spiritual master as the visible manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is necessary, therefore, to direct the devotee on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "The spiritual master must never be carried away by an accumulation of wealth or a large number of followers. A bona fide spiritual master will never become like that. But sometimes, if a spiritual master is not properly authorized and only on his own initiative becomes a spiritual master, he may be carried away by an accumulation of wealth and large numbers of disciples. His is not a very high grade of devotional service. If a person is carried away by such achievements, then his devotional service becomes slackened. One should therefore strictly adhere to the principles of disciplic succession.",
            "A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, being naturally purified, has no need of developing any other purificatory process of thought or action. On account of his being highly elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he has already acquired all the good qualities and is following the rules and regulations prescribed for the mystic yogic process. Such rules are automatically practiced by the devotees. A concrete example is the quality of nonviolence, which is considered a good qualification. A devotee is naturally nonviolent and therefore doesn\u2019t have to practice nonviolence separately. Some people seek purification by joining a vegetarian movement, but a devotee is automatically a vegetarian. He doesn\u2019t need to practice separately in this matter or to join any society for vegetarians. He is automatically a vegetarian.",
            "There are many other instances showing that a devotee needn\u2019t practice anything but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; all the good qualities of the demigods automatically develop within him. Those who are intentionally practicing to be vegetarians or to become nonviolent may have good qualifications by a material estimation, but these qualifications are not sufficient to make them devotees. A vegetarian is not necessarily a devotee, nor is a nonviolent person. But a devotee is automatically both vegetarian and nonviolent. We must conclude, therefore, that vegetarianism or nonviolence is not the cause of devotion.",
            "In this connection, there is a story in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47aabout a hunter who was converted into a great devotee under the instruction of N\u0101rada Muni. When the hunter became a perfect devotee he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Parvata Muni, a friend of N\u0101rada\u2019s, saw the wonderful transformation of the hunter by devotional service and remarked, \u201cMy dear hunter, your unwillingness to kill even an ant is not very astonishing. Any person who develops the devotional attitude hasallthe good qualities automatically manifested in his person. A devotee is never a cause of distress to anyone.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b affirms herein that purification of consciousness, purification of bodily activities, austerities, peace of mind, etc., all become automatically manifest in the person who is engaged in devotional service.",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b affirms herein that there are nine different kinds of devotional service, which are listed as hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity in the temple, praying, carrying out orders, serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a friend and sacrificing everything for Him. Each and every one of these processes is so powerful that if anyone follows even a single one of them he can achieve the desired perfection without fail. For example, if one is attached simply to hearing about the Lord and another is attached to chanting the glories of the name, both will achieve their desired goal in devotional service. In theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5btathis has been explained. One may execute one, two, three or all the different processes of devotional service, and at the ultimate end he will achieve the desired goal of being established in devotional service.",
            "There are concrete examples of how a devotee discharged one of these services and achieved perfection. King Par\u012bk\u1e63it achieved the desired goal of life simply by hearing\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b achieved the desired goal of life simply by reciting\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became successful in his devotional service by always remembering the Lord. Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, was successful by engaging herself in massaging the lotus feet of the Lord. King P\u1e5bthu became successful by worshiping in the temple. Akr\u016bra became successful by offering prayers. Hanum\u0101n became successful by rendering personal service to Lord R\u0101macandra. Arjuna became successful by being a friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became successful simply by offering all of his possessions to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There are also examples of devotees who discharged all the different items together. In the Ninth Canto, fourth chapter, verses 18, 19 and 20 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is a statement about Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, who followed every one of the devotional processes. In these verses, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cKing Ambar\u012b\u1e63a first of all concentrated his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then engaged his speech in describing the pastimes and activities of the Lord. He engaged his hands in washing the temple of the Lord. He engaged his ears in hearing of the transcendental glories of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the beautiful Deity in the temple. He engaged his body in associating with the pure devotees of the Lord. [When you associate with someone you have to sit down together, eat together, etc.\u00a0\u2013 and in this way the touch of your body with his body is inevitable. Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja made his association only with pure devotees and did not allow his body to be touched by anyone else.] He engaged his nostrils in smelling the flowers andtulas\u012boffered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he engaged his tongue in tastingk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da[food prepared specifically for offering to the Lord, the remnants of which are taken by the devotees]. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was able to offer very nicepras\u0101dato K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he was a king and had no scarcity of finances. He used to offer K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the most royal dishes and would then taste the remnants ask\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da.There was no scarcity in his royal style, because he had a very beautiful temple wherein the Deity of the Lord was decorated with costly paraphernalia and offered high-grade food. So everything was available, and his engagement was always completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d The idea is that we should follow in the footsteps of great devotees. If we are unable to execute all the different items of devotional service, we must try to execute at least one of them, as exemplified by previous\u0101c\u0101ryas.If we are engaged in the execution of all the items of devotional service, as was Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, then the perfection of devotional service is guaranteed from each one of these items. With the first complete engagement, one becomes automatically detached from material contamination, and liberation becomes the maidservant of the devotee. This idea is confirmed by Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura. If one develops unalloyed devotion to the Lord, liberation will follow the devotee as his maidservant.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the regulative principles of devotional service are sometimes described by authorities as the path of serving the Lord in opulence."

            "CHAPTER FIFTEEN",
            "Spontaneous Devotional Service",
            "Examples of spontaneous devotional service can easily be seen in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s direct associates in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The spontaneous dealings of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101.These beings don\u2019t have to learn anything about devotional service; they are already perfect in all regulative principles and have achieved the spontaneous loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For example, the cowherd boys who are playing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a do not have to learn by austerities or penances or yogic practice how to play with Him. They have passed all tests of regulative principles in their previous lives, and as a result they are now elevated to the position of direct association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His dear friends. Their spontaneous attitude is calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101-bhakti.",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has definedr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101-bhaktias spontaneous attraction for something while completely absorbed in thoughts of it, with an intense desire of love. Devotional service executed with such feelings of spontaneous love is calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101-bhakti.Devotional service under the heading ofr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101can be further divided into two categories: one category is called \u201csensual attraction,\u201d and the other is called \u201crelationship.\u201d",
            "In this connection, there is a statement by N\u0101rada Muni to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira in the Seventh Canto, first chapter, verse 30 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.There N\u0101rada says, \u201cMy dear King, there are many devotees who first become attracted to the Personality of Godhead for purposes of sense gratification, from being envious of Him, out of fear of Him or from desiring to associate affectionately with Him. Ultimately these attractions become freed from all material contamination, and gradually the worshiper develops spiritual love and achieves that ultimate goal of life desired by the pure devotee.\u201d",
            "Thegop\u012bsmay be considered to be examples of spontaneous love in sensual attraction. Thegop\u012bsare young girls and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a young boy. Superficially it seems that thegop\u012bsare attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on grounds of sex. Similarly, King Ka\u1e41sa was attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of fear. Ka\u1e41sa was always fearful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because it had been foretold that his sister\u2019s son, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, would kill him. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was also always envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And the descendants of King Yadu, due to their family relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, were always thinking of Him as one of their members. All of these different kinds of devotees have a spontaneous attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in different categories, and they achieve the same desired goal of life.",
            "The attraction of thegop\u012bsfor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the affection of the members of the Yadu dynasty are both accepted as spontaneous, orr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101.The attraction of Ka\u1e41sa to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in fear and the attraction of \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la in envy are not accepted as devotional service, however, because their attitudes are not favorable. Devotional service should be executed only in a favorable frame of mind. Therefore, according to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, such attractions are not considered to be in devotional service. Again, he analyzes the affection of the Yadus. If it is on the platform of friendship, then it is spontaneous love, but if it is on the platform of regulative principles, then it is not. And only when affection comes to the platform of spontaneous love is it counted in the category of pure devotional service.",
            "There may be some difficulty in understanding that both thegop\u012bsand Ka\u1e41sa achieved the same goal, so this point should be clearly understood, because the attitudes of Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la were different from that of thegop\u012bs.Although in all these cases the focus is on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all of the devotees are elevated to the spiritual world, there is still a distinction between these two classes of souls. In the First Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that the Absolute Truth is one and that He is manifested as impersonal Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 (Supersoul) and Bhagav\u0101n (the Supreme Personality of Godhead). Here is a spiritual distinction. Although Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n are the same-and-one Absolute Truth, devotees like Ka\u1e41sa or \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la could attain only to the Brahman effulgence. They could not have realization of Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n. That is the distinction.",
            "An analogy can be given with the sun globe and the sunshine: to remain in the sunshine does not mean one has gone to the sun globe. The temperature of the sun globe is different from the temperature of the sunshine. One who has gone through the sunshine in jet planes or in spaceships has not necessarily gone to the sun globe. Although the sunshine and the sun globe are actually one and the same, still there is a distinction, for one is the energy and one is the energetic source. The Absolute Truth and His bodily effulgence are in the same way simultaneously one and different. Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la attained to the Absolute Truth, but they were not allowed to enter into the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana abode. Impersonalists and the enemies of the Lord are, because of attraction to God, allowed to enter into His kingdom, but they are not allowed to enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet of the Supreme Lord. To enter the kingdom and to enter the king\u2019s palace are not the same thing.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b is trying here to describe the different achievements of the impersonalists and the personalists. Generally, those who are impersonalists and are inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead get entrance only into the impersonal Brahman, when and if they reach spiritual perfection. The impersonalist philosophers are in one sense like the enemies of the Lord because the out-and-out enemies of the Lord and the impersonalists are both allowed to enter only into the impersonal effulgence of thebrahma-jyotir.So it is to be understood that they are of similar classification. And actually the impersonalists are enemies of God because they cannot tolerate the unparalleled opulence of the Lord. They try always to place themselves on the same level with the Lord. That is due to their envious attitude. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has proclaimed the impersonalists to be offenders of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even though they are His enemies, they are still allowed to enter into the spiritual kingdom and remain in the impersonalbrahma-jyotir,the undifferentiated light of the Absolute.",
            "Sometimes an impersonalist may gradually elevate himself to the personal conception of the Lord.Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101confirms this: \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me.\u201d By such surrender, an impersonalist can be elevated to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka (spiritual planet) where, as a surrendered soul, he attains bodily features like those of the Lord.",
            "In theBrahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cThose who have achieved liberation from material contamination and those who are demons and are killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead become absorbed in the Brahman concept of life and reside in the spiritual sky of thebrahma-jyotir.\u201d That spiritual sky is far beyond the material sky, and it is confirmed also inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that beyond this material sky there is another, eternal sky. The enemies and the impersonalists may be allowed to enter into this Brahman effulgence, but the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are promoted all the way to the spiritual planets. Because the pure devotees have developed their spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are allowed to enter into the spiritual planets to enjoy spiritual bliss in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, eighty-seventh chapter, verse 23 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,theVedaspersonified address the Lord in this way: \u201cMy dear Lord,yog\u012bsmeditate upon Your localized feature, and thus they achieve the spiritual perfection of being merged in the impersonalbrahma-jyotir.Persons who treat You as an enemy achieve the same perfection without meditating. Thegop\u012bs,who are embraced by Your serpentine hands and who have such lusty attitudes, also achieve the same perfection. And as far as we are concerned, being different demigods in charge of the different parts of Vedic knowledge, we are always following in the footsteps of thegop\u012bs.Thus we hope to attain the same perfection.\u201d By \u201cthe same perfection\u201d we must always remember the example of the sun and the sunshine. Those who are impersonalists can merge into the sunshinelikebrahma-jyotir,whereas those who are in love with the Supreme Person enter into the supreme abode of the Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "The \u201clusty attitude\u201d of thegop\u012bsdoes not refer to any sort of sex indulgence. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that this \u201clusty desire\u201d refers to the devotee\u2019s particular attitude of association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Every devotee in his perfectional stage has a spontaneous attraction to the Lord. This attraction is sometimes called the \u201clusty desire\u201d of the devotee. The lust is the devotee\u2019s excessive desire to serve the Lord in a particular capacity. Such a desire may seem to be a desire for enjoying the Lord, but actually the endeavor is to serve the Lord in that capacity. For example, a devotee may be desiring to associate with the Personality of Godhead as His cowherd friend. He will want to serve the Lord by assisting Him in controlling the cows in the pasturing ground. This may appear to be a desire to enjoy the company of the Lord, but actually it is spontaneous love, serving Him by assisting in managing the transcendental cows.",
            "SENSUAL ATTRACTION",
            "This extreme desire to serve the Lord is manifest in the transcendental land of Vraja. And it is specifically manifested among thegop\u012bs.Thegop\u012bs\u2019 love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so elevated that for our understanding it is sometimes explained as being \u201clusty desire.\u201d",
            "The author of\u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta,Kavir\u0101ja K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa, has explained the distinction between lusty desire and the service attitude in this statement: \u201c\u2009\u2018Lusty desire\u2019 refers to the desire to gratify one\u2019s personal senses, and \u2018transcendental desire\u2019 refers to the desire for serving the senses of the Lord.\u201d In the material world there is no such thing as a lover\u2019s wanting to please the senses of his beloved. Actually, in the material world, everyone wants mainly to gratify his own personal senses. Thegop\u012bs,however, wanted nothing at all but to gratify the senses of the Lord, and there is no instance of this in the material world. Therefore thegop\u012bs\u2019 ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes described by scholars as being like the \u201clusty desire\u201d of the material world, but actually this should not be taken as a literal fact. It is simply a way of trying to understand the transcendental situation.",
            "Great devotees up to the standard of Uddhava are very dear friends of the Lord, and they desire to follow in the footsteps of thegop\u012bs.So thegop\u012bs\u2019 love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly not material lusty desire. Otherwise, how could Uddhava aspire to follow in their footsteps? Another instance is Lord Caitanya Himself. After accepting thesanny\u0101saorder of life, He was very, very strict about avoiding association with women, but still He taught that there is no better method of worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a than that conceived by thegop\u012bs.Thus thegop\u012bs\u2019 method of worshiping the Lord as if impelled by lusty desire was praised very highly even by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. This very fact means that although the attraction of thegop\u012bsfor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears to be lusty, it is not in the least bit material. Unless one is fully situated in the transcendental position, the relationship of thegop\u012bswith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very difficult to understand. But because it appears to be just like ordinary dealings of young boys and girls, it is sometimes misinterpreted to be like the ordinary sex of this material world. Unfortunately, persons who cannot understand the transcendental nature of the love affairs of thegop\u012bsand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a take it for granted that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s love affairs with thegop\u012bsare mundane transactions, and therefore they sometimes indulge in painting licentious pictures in some modernistic style.",
            "On the other hand, the lusty desire of Kubj\u0101 is described by learned scholars as being \u201calmost lusty desire.\u201d Kubj\u0101 was a hunchbacked woman who also wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with a great ecstatic love. But her desire for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was almost mundane, and so her love cannot be compared to the love of thegop\u012bs.Her loving affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is calledk\u0101ma-pr\u0101y\u0101,or almost like thegop\u012bs\u2019 love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "Spontaneous Devotion Further Described",
            "RELATIONSHIP",
            "In the attitude of the denizens of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, such as Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, is to be found the ideal transcendental concept of being the father and mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original Personality of Godhead. Factually, no one can become the father or mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but a devotee\u2019s possession of such transcendental feelings is called love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a parental relationship. The V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s relatives at Dv\u0101rak\u0101) also felt like that. So spontaneous love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the parental relationship is found both among those denizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 who belonged to the dynasty of V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i and among the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "Spontaneous love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as exhibited by the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is and the denizens of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is eternally existing in them. In the stage of devotional service where regulative principles are followed, there is no necessity of discussing this love, for it must develop of itself at a more advanced stage.",
            "ELIGIBILITY FOR SPONTANEOUS DEVOTIONAL SERVICE",
            "Persons desiring to follow in the footsteps of such eternal devotees of the Lord as the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana denizens are calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101devotees, which means that they are trying to attain to the perfection of those devotees. Theser\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101devotees do not follow the regulative principles of devotional service very strictly, but by spontaneous nature they become attracted to some of the eternal devotees such as Nanda or Ya\u015bod\u0101, and they try to follow in their footsteps spontaneously. There is a gradual development of the ambition to become like a particular devotee, and this activity is calledr\u0101g\u0101nug\u0101.",
            "We must always remember, however, that such eagerness to follow in the footsteps of the denizens of Vraja (V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) is not possible unless one is freed from material contamination. In following the regulative principles of devotional service, there is a stage calledanartha-niv\u1e5btti,which means the disappearance of all material contamination. Sometimes someone is found imitating such devotional love, but factually he is not freed fromanarthas,or unwanted habits. It has been seen that a so-called devotee proclaims himself a follower of Nanda, Ya\u015bod\u0101 or thegop\u012bs,while at the same time his abominable attraction for mundane sex life is visible. Such a manifestation of divine love is mere imitation and has no value. When one is actually spontaneously attracted to the loving principles of thegop\u012bs,there will be found no trace of any mundane contamination in his character.",
            "Therefore, in the beginning, everyone should strictly follow the regulative principles of devotional service according to the injunctions of the scriptures and the spiritual master. Only after the stage of liberation from material contamination can one actually aspire to follow in the footsteps of the devotees in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "It is said by \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cWhen one is actually liberated from material contamination, he can always remember an eternal devotee in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in order to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same capacity. And developing such an aptitude, one will always live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, even within his mind.\u201d The purport is that if it is possible one should go and physically be present at Vraja-bh\u016bmi, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and be engaged always in the service of the Lord, following the devotees in Vraja-dh\u0101ma, the spiritual realm of Vraja. If it is not possible, however, to be physically present at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, one can meditate anywhere on living in that situation. Wherever he may be, one must always think about life in Vraja-dh\u0101ma and about following in the footsteps of a particular devotee in the service of the Lord.",
            "A devotee who is actually advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who is constantly engaged in devotional service, should not manifest himself, even though he has attained perfection. The idea is that he should always continue to act as a neophyte devotee as long as his material body is there. Activities in devotional service under regulative principles must be followed even by the pure devotee. But when he realizes his actual position in relationship with the Lord, he can, along with the discharging of regulative service, think within himself of the Lord under the guidance of a particular associate of the Lord, and develop his transcendental sentiments in following that associate.",
            "In this connection, we should be careful about the so-calledsiddha-pra\u1e47\u0101l\u012b.Thesiddha-pra\u1e47\u0101l\u012bprocess is followed by a class of men who are not very authorized and who have manufactured their own way of devotional service. They imagine that they have become associates of the Lord simply by thinking of themselves like that. This external behavior is not at all according to the regulative principles. The so-calledsiddha-pra\u1e47\u0101l\u012bprocess is followed by thepr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101,a pseudosect of so-called Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In the opinion of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, such activities are simply disturbances to the standard way of devotional service.",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that learned\u0101c\u0101ryasrecommend that we follow the regulative principles even after the development of spontaneous love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to the regulative principles, there are nine departmental activities, as described above, and one should specifically engage himself in the type of devotional service for which he has a natural aptitude. For example, one person may have a particular interest in hearing, another may have a particular interest in chanting, and another may have a particular interest in serving in the temple. So these, or any of the other six different types of devotional service (remembering, serving, praying, engaging in some particular service, being in a friendly relationship or offering everything in one\u2019s possession), should be executed in full earnestness. In this way, everyone should act according to his particular taste.",
            "CONJUGAL LOVE",
            "Devotional service following in the footsteps of thegop\u012bsof V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or the queens at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 is called devotional service in conjugal love. This devotional service in conjugal love can be divided into two categories. One is indirect conjugal love, the other direct. In both of these categories, one has to follow the particulargop\u012bwho is engaged in such service in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. To be directly attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in conjugal love is technically calledkeli.Thiskeliperformance means to directly join with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are other devotees who do not wish direct contact with the Supreme Person, but who relish the conjugal love affairs of the Lord with thegop\u012bs.Such devotees enjoy simply by hearing of the activities of the Lord with thegop\u012bs.",
            "This development of conjugal love can be possible only with those who are already engaged in following the regulative principles of devotional service, specifically in the worship of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the temple. Such devotees gradually develop a spontaneous love for the Deity, and by hearing of the Lord\u2019s exchange of loving affairs with thegop\u012bs,they gradually become attracted to these pastimes. After this spontaneous attraction becomes highly developed, the devotee is placed in either of the above-mentioned categories.",
            "This development of conjugal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not manifested in women only. The material body has nothing to do with spiritual loving affairs. A woman may develop an attitude for becoming a friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and, similarly, a man may develop the feature of becoming agop\u012bin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. How a devotee in the form of a man can desire to become agop\u012bis stated in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aas follows: In days gone by there were many sages in Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya. Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya is the name of the forest where Lord R\u0101macandra lived after being banished by His father for fourteen years. At that time there were many advanced sages who were captivated by the beauty of Lord R\u0101macandra and who desired to become women in order to embrace the Lord. Later on, these sages appeared in Gokula V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advented Himself there, and they were born asgop\u012bs,or girlfriends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this way they attained the perfection of spiritual life.",
            "The story of the sages of Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya can be explained as follows. When Lord R\u0101macandra was residing in Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya, the sages who were engaged in devotional service there became attracted by His beauty and immediately thought of thegop\u012bsin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who enjoyed conjugal loving affection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this instance it is clear that the sages of Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya desired conjugal love in the manner of thegop\u012bs,although they were well aware of the Supreme Lord as both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord R\u0101macandra. They knew that although R\u0101macandra was an ideal king and could not accept more than one wife, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the full-fledged Personality of Godhead, could fulfill the desires of all of them in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. These sages also concluded that the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is more attractive than that of Lord R\u0101macandra, and so they prayed to becomegop\u012bsin their future lives to be associated with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Lord R\u0101macandra remained silent, and His silence shows that He accepted the prayers of the sages. Thus they were blessed by Lord R\u0101macandra to have association with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in their future lives. As a result of this benediction, they all took birth as women in the wombs ofgop\u012bsat Gokula, and as they had desired in their previous lives, they enjoyed the company of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was present at that time in Gokula V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The perfection of their human form of life was thus achieved by their generating a transcendental sentiment to share conjugal love with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Conjugal love is divided into two classifications\u00a0\u2013 namely, conjugal love as husband and wife and conjugal love as lover and beloved. One who develops conjugal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a wife is promoted to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where the devotee becomes the queen of the Lord. One who develops conjugal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a lover is promoted to Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to associate with thegop\u012bsand enjoy loving affairs with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there. We should note carefully, however, that this conjugal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, either asgop\u012bor as queen, is not limited only to women. Even men can develop such sentiments, as was evidenced by the sages of Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya. If someone simply desires conjugal love but does not follow in the footsteps of thegop\u012bs,he is promoted to association with the Lord at Dv\u0101rak\u0101.",
            "In theMah\u0101-k\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cGreat sages who were the sons of fire-gods rigidly followed the regulative principles in their desire to have conjugal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As such, in their next lives they were able to associate with the Lord, the origin of all creation, who is known as V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and all of them got Him as their husband.\u201d",
            "PARENTHOOD OR FRIENDSHIP",
            "Devotees who are attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as parents or as friends should follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja or Subala respectively. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the foster father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and out of all of the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Subala is the most intimate in Vraja-bh\u016bmi.",
            "In the development of becoming either the father or friend of the Lord, there are two varieties. One method is that one may try to become the father of the Lord directly, and the other is that one may follow Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and cherish the ideal of being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father. Out of these two, the attempt to directly become the father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not recommended. Such a development can become polluted with M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da (impersonal) philosophy. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, or monists, think that they themselves are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if one thinks that he himself has become Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, then his parental love will become contaminated with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophical way of thinking is offensive, and no offender can enter into the kingdom of God to associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a story of an old man residing in Hastin\u0101pura, capital of the kingdom of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dus, who desired K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his beloved son. This old man was instructed by N\u0101rada to follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and thus he achieved success.",
            "There is a statement in theN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-vy\u016bha-stavaprayers that persons who are always engaged in thinking of the Lord as their husband, friend, father or well-wisher are always worshipable by everyone. This spontaneous love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be developed only by the special mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His pure devotee. This process of devotional service is sometimes calledpu\u1e63\u1e6di-m\u0101rga. Pu\u1e63\u1e6dimeans \u201cnourishing\u201d andm\u0101rgameans \u201cpath.\u201d Such development of sentiment nourishes devotional service to the highest standard. Thus it is called the path of nourishment, orpu\u1e63\u1e6di-m\u0101rga.The Vallabhasamprad\u0101ya,which belongs to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Sv\u0101m\u012b sect of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava religion, worships K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in thispu\u1e63\u1e6di-m\u0101rga.Generally devotees in Gujarat worship B\u0101la K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under this heading ofpu\u1e63\u1e6di-m\u0101rga."

            "Ecstatic Love",
            "By the process of executing regulated devotional service, one is actually elevated to the transcendental stage, beyond the material modes of nature. At that time one\u2019s heart becomes illuminated like the sun. The sun is far above the planetary systems, and there is no possibility of its being covered by any kind of cloud; similarly, when a devotee is purified like the sun, from his pure heart there is a diffusion of ecstatic love which is more glorious than the sunshine. Only at that time is the attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a perfect. Spontaneously, the devotee becomes eager to serve the Lord in his ecstatic love. At this stage the devotee is on the platform ofuttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b,perfect devotion. Such a devotee has no agitation from material affections and is interested only in the service of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "To clarify, in the previous chapters the symptoms of devotional service were explained along with instructions as to how we may execute devotional service with our present senses and gradually rise to the platform of ecstasy in spontaneous love. And the two kinds of devotional service\u00a0\u2013 namely, devotional service through regulative principles and through spontaneous love\u00a0\u2013 were discussed. Within the stage of the regulative principles of devotional service there are two divisions\u00a0\u2013 namely, executive and effective. This effective portion of devotional service is calledbh\u0101va,or ecstasy. In this connection, there is a statement in thetantrasthat ecstasy is the first symptom of pure love for the Personality of Godhead, and in that stage one is sometimes found shedding tears or shivering. Not always are these symptoms manifest, but occasionally. When King Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was put into difficulty by Durv\u0101s\u0101, he began to think of the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus there were some changes in his body, and tears were falling from his eyes. These symptoms are activities of ecstasy. They are visible in the shivering of the body and the shedding of tears. After the outward appearance of these ecstatic symptoms, they stay within the mind, and continuation of the ecstasy is calledsam\u0101dhi.This stage of appreciation becomes the cause of future exchanges of loving affairs with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Elevation to this stage of ecstasy can be possible in two ways. One way is by constant association with pure devotees. The other way is by the special mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or by the mercy of a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Elevation to the ecstatic stage of life is generally attained through association with pure devotees, while elevation to that stage by the special mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His devotee is very rare. The purport is that one should execute devotional service rigidly in the association of devotees so that there will be certainty in raising oneself to that ecstatic position. In special cases, of course, there is special favor from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and although we should always expect that, we should not sit idly and simply wait for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s special mercy; the regular duties must be performed. It is just as when sometimes it is found that a person who never attended school or college may be recognized as a great scholar, or an honorary degree from great universities may be offered to him. But this does not mean that one should avoid school and expect to automatically receive an honorary degree from some university. Similarly, one should devoutly execute the regulative principles of devotional service and at the same time hope for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s favor or for His devotee\u2019s favor.",
            "An example of rising to the stage of ecstatic love by executing the regulative principles of devotional service is given in the life story of N\u0101rada, which is described to Vy\u0101sadeva in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.N\u0101rada tells there of his previous life and how he developed to the stage of ecstatic love. He was engaged in the service of great devotees and used to hear their talks and songs. Because he had the opportunity to hear these pastimes and songs of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the mouths of pure devotees, he became very attracted within his heart. Because he had become so eager to hear these topics, he gradually developed within himself an ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This ecstatic love is prior to the pure love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because in the next verse N\u0101rada confirms that by the gradual process of hearing from the great sages he developed love of Godhead. In that connection, N\u0101rada continues to say in the First Canto, fifth chapter, verse 28 of theBh\u0101gavatam,\u201cFirst I passed my days in the association of the great sages during the rainy autumn season. Every morning and evening I heard them while they were singing and chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra,and thus my heart gradually became purified. As soon as I heard them with great attention, the influence of the modes of material ignorance and passion disappeared, and I became firmly fixed in devotional service to the Lord.\u201d",
            "These are practical examples of how one can develop to the stage of ecstatic love simply by the association of pure devotees. It is essential, therefore, that one constantly associate with pure devotees who are engaged morning and evening in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.In this way one will get the chance to purify his heart and develop this ecstatic pure love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "This statement is also confirmed in the Third Canto, twenty-fifth chapter, verse 25 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,where Lord Kapila says, \u201cMy dear mother, when a person is actually in association with pure devotees, the sublime potency of My devotional service can be experienced.\u201d In other words, when a pure devotee speaks, his words act upon the hearts of the audience. What is the secret of hearing and chanting? A professional speaker cannot impress transcendental ecstasy within the hearts of the listeners. However, when a realized soul who is engaged in the service of the Lord is speaking, he has the potency to inject spiritual life within the audience. One should, therefore, seek the association of such pure, unalloyed devotees, and by such association and service a neophyte devotee will certainly develop attachment, love and devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is the story of a neophyte devotee who, in order to raise herself to the ecstatic platform, danced all night to invoke the Lord\u2019s grace upon her.",
            "Sometimes, however, it is found that without undergoing any devotional process, one all of a sudden develops devotion for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This sudden development of the devotional attitude in a person must be understood as a special mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or of His devotee. This apparently accidental development of ecstatic feelings through the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be divided into three groups: simply by speaking, simply by glancing and simply by good wishes.",
            "In theN\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about development of ecstatic love simply by speaking. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said to N\u0101rada, \u201cO best of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,I wish that you may develop unalloyed devotional service to Me, which is full of transcendental bliss and all auspiciousness.\u201d",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about developing ecstatic love toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply by glancing. It is stated there, \u201cWhen the inhabitants of J\u0101\u1e45gala Province saw the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they were so stricken with feeling that they could not withdraw their glance from Him.\u201d",
            "As far as heartfelt wishes are concerned, there is a statement in the\u015auka-sa\u1e41hit\u0101where N\u0101rada tells \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, \u201cYou have a son who is the greatest devotee of the Personality of Godhead, and I can observe that without any following of the regulative principles of devotional service, he is already enriched with many of the symptoms achieved by the execution of devotional service after many, many births.\u201d",
            "As for ecstatic love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is a statement in the Seventh Canto, fourth chapter, verse 36 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,in which N\u0101rada addresses King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, \u201cMy dear King, it is very difficult to describe the character of Prahl\u0101da. He developed a natural attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and whatever I can explain about his character will simply be an arrangement of words; his actual character is impossible to describe.\u201d This means that N\u0101rada himself admitted that the natural development of Prahl\u0101da\u2019s ecstatic love was by the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "This natural attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the part of Prahl\u0101da was developed simply by the mercy of N\u0101rada. When Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was within the womb of his mother, she was being sympathetically instructed by N\u0101rada about the science of devotional service, and at the same time N\u0101rada was wishing that the child within the womb could also take advantage of the instructions. Because N\u0101rada, an authorized devotee and great associate of the Personality of Godhead, was desiring auspiciousness for Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he developed all the characteristics of a high-grade devotee. This is called natural attraction. It is caused by the special grace of the Personality of Godhead or by the special grace of a great devotee like N\u0101rada.",
            "There is a statement in theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47awherein Parvata Muni tells N\u0101rada, \u201cMy dear N\u0101rada, of all saintly persons you are so great and glorious that simply by your good wishes a lowborn hunter also has become a great, elevated devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "This ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be divided into five divisions, which will be described by \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b later on."

            "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN",
            "Character of One In Ecstatic Love",
            "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b next describes the characteristics of a person who has actually developed his ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The characteristics are as follows:",
            "1.\u2009\u2009He is always anxious to utilize his time in the devotional service of the Lord. He does not like to be idle. He wants service always, twenty-four hours a day, without deviation.",
            "2.\u2009\u2009He is always reserved and perseverant.",
            "3.\u2009\u2009He is always detached from all material attraction.",
            "4.\u2009\u2009He does not long for any material respect in return for his activities.",
            "5.\u2009\u2009He is always certain that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will bestow His mercy upon him.",
            "6.\u2009\u2009He is always very eager to serve the Lord faithfully.",
            "7.\u2009\u2009He is very much attached to the chanting of the holy names of the Lord.",
            "8.\u2009\u2009He is always eager to describe the transcendental qualities of the Lord.",
            "9.\u2009\u2009He is very pleased to live in a place where the Lord\u2019s pastimes are performed, e.g., Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Dv\u0101rak\u0101.",
            "UTILIZATION OF TIME",
            "An unalloyed devotee who has developed ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always engaging his words in reciting prayers to the Lord. Within the mind he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and with his body he either offers obeisances by bowing down before the Deity or engages in some other service. During these ecstatic activities he sometimes sheds tears. In this way his whole life is engaged in the service of the Lord, with not a moment wasted on any other engagement.",
            "PERSEVERANCE",
            "When a person is undisturbed even in the presence of various causes of disturbance, he is called reserved and perseverant. An example of this perseverance and reservation is found in the behavior of King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, as described in the First Canto, nineteenth chapter, verse 15 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.The king says there to all the sages present before him at the time of his death, \u201cMy dearbr\u0101hma\u1e47as,you should always accept me as your surrendered servant. I have come to the bank of the Ganges just to devote my heart and soul unto the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So please bless me that mother Ganges may also be pleased with me. Let the curse of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019sson fall upon me\u00a0\u2013 I do not mind. I only request that at the last moment of my life all of you will kindly chant the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u so that I may realize His transcendental qualities.\u201d",
            "This example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s behavior, his remaining patient even at the last point of his life, his undisturbed condition of mind, is an example of reservation. This is one of the characteristics of a devotee who has developed ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "DETACHMENT",
            "The senses are always desiring sense enjoyment, but when a devotee develops transcendental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a his senses are no longer attracted by material desires. This state of mind is called detachment. There is a nice example of this detachment in connection with the character of King Bharata. In the Fifth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 43 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated, \u201cEmperor Bharata was so attracted by the beauty of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that even in his youthful life he gave up all kinds of attachments to family, children, friends, kingdom, etc., as though they were untouchable stools.\u201d",
            "Emperor Bharata provides a typical example of detachment. He had everything enjoyable in the material world, but he left it. This means that detachment does not mean artificially keeping oneself aloof and apart from the allurements of attachment. Even in the presence of such allurements, if one can remain unattracted by material attachments, he is called detached. In the beginning, of course, a neophyte devotee must try to keep himself apart from all kinds of alluring attachments, but the real position of a mature devotee is that even in the presence of all allurements, he is not at all attracted. This is the actual criterion of detachment.",
            "PRIDELESSNESS",
            "When a devotee, in spite of possessing all the qualities of pure realization, is not proud of his position, he is called prideless. In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated that King Bhag\u012bratha was the emperor above all other kings, yet he developed such ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he became a mendicant and went out begging even to the homes of his political enemies and untouchables. He was so humble that he respectfully bowed down before them.",
            "There are many similar instances in the history of India. Even very recently, about two hundred years ago or less, one big landlord known as Lal Babu, a Calcutta landholder, became a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and lived in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He was also begging from door to door, even at the homes of his political enemies. Begging involves being ready to be insulted by persons to whose home one has come. That is natural. But one has to tolerate such insults for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can accept any position in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "GREAT HOPE",
            "The strong conviction that one will certainly receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called in Sanskrit\u0101\u015b\u0101-bandha. \u0100\u015b\u0101-bandhameans to continue to think, \u201cBecause I\u2019m trying my best to follow the routine principles of devotional service, I am sure that I will go back to Godhead, back to home.\u201d",
            "In this connection, one prayer by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b is sufficient to exemplify this hopefulness. He says, \u201cI have no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor for the causes of developing love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 namely, hearing and chanting. And the process ofbhakti-yoga,by which one is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fixing His lotus feet in the heart, is also lacking in me. As far as philosophical knowledge or pious works are concerned, I don\u2019t see any opportunity for me to execute such activities. But above all, I am not even born of a nice family. Therefore I must simply pray to You, Gop\u012bjana-vallabha [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, maintainer and beloved of thegop\u012bs]. I simply wish and hope that some way or other I may be able to approach Your lotus feet, and this hope is giving me pain, because I think myself quite incompetent to approach that transcendental goal of life.\u201d The purport is that under this heading of\u0101\u015b\u0101-bandha,one should continue to hope against hope that some way or other he will be able to approach the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.",
            "EAGERNESS FOR ACHIEVING THE DESIRED SUCCESS",
            "When one is sufficiently eager to achieve success in devotional service, that eagerness is calledsamutka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101.This means \u201ccomplete eagerness.\u201d Actually this eagerness is the price for achieving success in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Everything has some value, and one has to pay the value before obtaining or possessing it. It is stated in the Vedic literature that to purchase the most valuable thing, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to develop intense eagerness for achieving success. This intense eagerness is very nicely expressed by Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura in his bookK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta.He says, \u201cI am eagerly waiting to see that boy of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana whose bodily beauty is captivating the whole universe, whose eyes are always bounded by black eyebrows and expanded like lotus petals, and who is always eagerly glancing over His devotees and therefore moving slightly here and there. His eyes are always moist, His lips are colored like copper, and through those lips there comes a sound vibration which drives one madder than a mad elephant. I want so much to see Him at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana!\u201d",
            "ATTACHMENT TO CHANTING THE HOLY NAMES OF THE LORD",
            "In the sameK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btathere is another statement about the chanting of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. It is said by one of the associates of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, \u201cO Lord Govinda, the girl who is the daughter of King V\u1e5b\u1e63abh\u0101nu is now shedding tears, and She is anxiously chanting Your holy name\u00a0\u2013 \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!

            "EAGERNESS TO DESCRIBE THE LORD\u2019S TRANSCENDENTAL QUALITIES",
            "Attachment for chanting the glories of the Lord is also expressed in theK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btaas follows: \u201cWhat shall I do for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is pleasing beyond all pleasurable conceptions, and who is naughtier than all restless boys? The idea of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s beautiful activities is attracting my heart, and I do not know what I can do!\u201d",
            "ATTRACTION FOR LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A HAS HIS PASTIMES",
            "In the bookPady\u0101val\u012bby R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b there is the following statement about V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana: \u201cIn this place the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda used to live with His father, who was king of all cowherd men. In this place Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a broke the cart in which the \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura demon was concealed. At this place D\u0101modara, who can cut the knot of our material existence, was tied up by His mother, Ya\u015bod\u0101.\u201d",
            "A pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resides in the district of Mathur\u0101 or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and visits all the places where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes were performed. At these sacred places K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a displayed His childhood activities with the cowherd boys and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. The system of circumambulating all these places is still current among devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and those coming to Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana always feel transcendental pleasure. Actually, if someone goes to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he will immediately feel separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who performed such nice activities when He was present there.",
            "Such attraction for remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities is known as attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are impersonalist philosophers and mystics, however, who by a show of devotional service want ultimately to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord. They sometimes try to imitate a pure devotee\u2019s sentiment for visiting the holy places where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had His pastimes, but they simply have a view for salvation, and so their activities cannot be considered attachment.",
            "It is said by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b that the attachment exhibited by pure devotees for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot possibly be perfected in the hearts of fruitive workers (karm\u012bs) or mental speculators because such attachment in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very rare and not possible to achieve even for many liberated persons. As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,liberation from material contamination is the stage at which devotional service can be achieved. For a person who simply wants to have liberation and to merge into the impersonalbrahma-jyotir,attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not possible to acquire. This attachment is very confidentially kept by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is bestowed only upon pure devotees. Even ordinary devotees cannot have such pure attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, how is it possible for success to be achieved by persons whose hearts are contaminated by the actions and reactions of fruitive activities and who are entangled by various types of mental speculation?",
            "There are many so-called devotees who artificially think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes known asa\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101l\u012bya-l\u012bl\u0101.Sometimes one may artificially imitate these, pretending that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is talking with him in the form of a boy, or else one may pretend that R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a both have come to him and are talking with him. Such characteristics are sometimes exhibited by the impersonalist class of men, and they may captivate some innocent persons who have no knowledge in the science of devotional service. However, as soon as an experienced devotee sees all of these caricatures, he can immediately evaluate such rascaldom. If such a pretender is sometimes seen possessing imitative attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that will not be accepted as real attachment. It may be said, however, that such attachment gives the pretender hope that he may eventually rise onto the actual platform of pure devotional service.",
            "This imitative attachment can be divided into two headings\u00a0\u2013 namely, shadow attachment andpar\u0101(transcendental) attachment. If someone, without undergoing the regulative principles of devotional service or without being guided by a bona fide spiritual master, shows such imitative attachment, this is called shadow attachment. Sometimes it is found that a person actually attached to material enjoyment or salvation has the good fortune to associate with pure devotees while they are engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord. By the good grace of the Lord one may also cooperate and join in the chanting. At that time, simply by the association of such pure devotees, the moonlike rays from their hearts reflect on him, and by the influence of the pure devotees he may show some likeness of attachment caused by inquisitiveness, but this is very flickering. And if by the manifestation of such shadow attachment one feels the disappearance of all material pangs, then it is calledpar\u0101attachment.",
            "Such shadow attachment orpar\u0101attachment can develop if one associates with a pure devotee or visits holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Mathur\u0101, and if an ordinary man develops such attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fortunately performs devotional activities in the association of pure devotees, he can also rise to the platform of pure devotional service. The conclusion is that transcendental attachment is so powerful that if such attachment is seen manifested even in some common man, by the association of a pure devotee it can bring one to the perfectional stage. But such attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be invoked in a person without his being sufficiently blessed by the association of pure devotees.",
            "As attachment can be invoked by the association of pure devotees, so attachment can also be extinguished by offenses committed at the lotus feet of pure devotees. To be more clear, by the association of pure devotees attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be aroused, but if one commits offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee, one\u2019s shadow attachment orpar\u0101attachment can be extinguished. This extinguishing is like the waning of the full moon, which gradually decreases and at last becomes dark. One should therefore be very careful while associating with pure devotees to guard against committing an offense at their lotus feet.",
            "Transcendental attachment, either shadow orpar\u0101,can be nullified by different degrees of offenses at the lotus feet of pure devotees. If the offense is very serious, then one\u2019s attachment becomes almost nil, and if the offense is not very serious, one\u2019s attachment can become second class or third class.",
            "If someone becomes attached to the principles of salvation or to merging into the existence of thebrahma-jyotir,his ecstasies gradually diminish into shadow andpar\u0101attachment or else transform into the principles ofaha\u1e45grahop\u0101san\u0101.Thisaha\u1e45grahop\u0101san\u0101describes a living entity when he begins spiritual realization by identifying himself with the Supreme Lord. This state of self-realization is technically known as monism. The monist thinks himself one with the Supreme Lord. Thus, because he does not differentiate between himself and the Supreme Lord, it is his view that by worshiping himself he is worshiping the supreme whole.",
            "Sometimes it is found that a neophyte is taking part in chanting and dancing very enthusiastically, but within himself he is under the impression that he has become one with the supreme whole. This conception of monism is completely different from pure, transcendental devotional service. If, however, it is seen that a person has developed a high standard of devotion without having undergone even the regulative principles, it is to be understood that his status of devotional service was achieved in a former life. For some reason or another it had been temporarily stopped, most probably by an offense committed at the lotus feet of a devotee. Now, with a good second chance, it has again begun to develop. The conclusion is that steady progress in devotional service can be attained only in the association of pure devotees.",
            "If one can gradually advance his status in devotional service, this is understood to be due to the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. If a person is completely detached from material enjoyment and has developed pure ecstatic devotion, even if he is sometimes accidentally found not living up to the standard of devotional service, one should not be envious of him. It is confirmed also inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that a devotee who has unflinching faith in and devotion to the Lord, even if sometimes found to be accidentally deviated from pure devotional characteristics, should still be counted among the pure. Unflinching faith in devotional service, in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and in the spiritual master makes one highly elevated in the activities of devotional service.",
            "In theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is stated, \u201cIf a person has completely engaged his mind, body and activities in the service of the Supreme Godhead, but externally he is found to be engaged in some abominable activities, these abominable activities will surely be very quickly vanquished by the influence of his staunch devotional force.\u201d The example is given that on the full moon there are some spots that may appear to be pockmarks. Still, the illumination spread by the full moon cannot be checked. Similarly, a little fault in the midst of volumes of devotional service is not at all to be counted as a fault. Attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental bliss. Amid unlimited volumes of transcendental bliss, a spot of some material defect cannot act in any way."

            "CHAPTER NINETEEN",
            "Devotional Service In Pure Love of God",
            "When one\u2019s desire to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in one\u2019s particular relationship becomes intensified, this is known as pure love of Godhead. In the beginning a devotee is engaged in the regulative principles of devotional service by the order of his spiritual master. When one thereby becomes completely purified of all material contamination, there develops an attachment and taste for devotional service. This taste and attachment, when gradually intensified in the course of time, becomes love. The wordlovecan actually be applied only in relationship with the Personality of Godhead. In the material world, love is not applicable at all. What goes on under the name of love in the material world is nothing but lust. There is a gulf of difference between love and lust, like the difference between gold and iron. In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trait is clearly stated that when lust is completely transferred to the Supreme Godhead and the concept of kinship is completely reposed in Him, such is accepted as pure love of God by great authorities like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Prahl\u0101da, Uddhava and N\u0101rada.",
            "Great authorities like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma have explained that love of Godhead means completely giving up all so-called love for any other person. According to Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, love means reposing one\u2019s affection completely upon one person, withdrawing all affinities for any other person. This pure love can be transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead under two conditions\u00a0\u2013 out of ecstasy and out of the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.",
            "ECSTASY",
            "Ecstatic love of Godhead can be potently invoked simply by following the rules and regulations of devotional service as they are prescribed in scriptures, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In the Eleventh Canto, second chapter, verse 40 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,this ecstatic love, born of the execution of regulative devotional service, is explained: \u201cA devotee, in the course of executing the regulative principles of devotional service, develops his natural K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and being thus softened at heart he chants and dances like a madman. While performing chanting of the holy name of the Lord, he sometimes cries, sometimes talks wildly, sometimes sings and sometimes\u00a0\u2013 without caring for any outsider\u00a0\u2013 dances like a madman.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about ecstatic love born of spontaneous affection. Candrak\u0101nti, a celebrated fair-faced girl, rigidly observed celibacy in order to obtain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as her husband. She always engaged herself in meditating on the transcendental form of the Lord and always chanted the glories of the Lord. She did not desire to accept anyone else as her husband. She had firmly decided that only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would be her husband.",
            "THE LORD\u2019S EXTRAORDINARY MERCY",
            "When a devotee is found to be always associated with the Lord in ecstatic love, it is to be understood that such a position has been awarded by the Lord Himself out of His causeless extraordinary mercy. An example of such extraordinary mercy is given in the Eleventh Canto, twelfth chapter, verse 7 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,wherein Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Uddhava, \u201cThegop\u012bsin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana did not study theVedasto achieve Me. Nor had they ever been to holy places of pilgrimage. Nor did they devoutly execute any regulative principle. Nor did they undergo any kind of austerity. It is simply by My association that they have attained the highest perfection of devotional service.\u201d",
            "From the example of Candrak\u0101nti as found in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aand from the example of thegop\u012bsas found in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,it appears that a devotee who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who always chants His glories in ecstatic love, regardless of his condition, will attain the highest perfection of unalloyed devotional love due to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s extraordinary mercy. This is confirmed in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\u201cIf a person worships, adores and loves Hari, the Supreme Lord, he should be understood to have finished all kinds of austerities, penances and similar processes for self-realization. On the other hand, if after undergoing all types of austerities, penances and mysticyogapractices one does not develop such love for Hari, then all his performances are to be considered a useless waste of time. If someone always sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inside and out, then it is to be understood that he has surpassed all austerities and penances for self-realization. And if, after executing all kinds of penances and austerities, one cannot always see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inside and out, then he has executed his performances uselessly.\u201d",
            "Spontaneous attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is said to be due to the extraordinary mercy of the Lord, can be placed under two headings: one is profound veneration for the greatness of the Lord, and the other is one\u2019s being automatically attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without any extraneous consideration. In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trait is said that if on account of profound veneration for the greatness of the Supreme Lord one attains a great affection and steady love for Him, one is certainly assured of attaining the four kinds of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava liberation\u00a0\u2013 namely, achieving the same bodily features as the Lord, achieving the same opulence as the Lord, dwelling on the planet where the Lord is residing, and attaining eternal association with the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava liberation is completely different from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da liberation, which is simply a matter of being merged into the effulgence of the Lord.",
            "In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101trapure, unalloyed devotional service is explained as being without any motive for personal benefit. If a devotee is continuously in love with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and his mind is always fixed upon Him, that devotional attitude will prove to be the only means of attracting the attention of the Lord. In other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who is incessantly thinking of the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to be known as a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.",
            "Generally, a devotee who has achieved the causeless mercy of the Lord on account of following the strict rules and regulations of devotional service becomes attracted by the supreme greatness of the Lord, by the transcendental beauty of the Lord and by the spontaneous execution of devotional service. To be more clear, by executing the regulative principles of devotional service one can fully appreciate the transcendental beauty of the Lord. In any case, such exalted positions are possible only by the extraordinary mercy of the Lord upon the devotee.",
            "ASSOCIATION WITH PURE DEVOTEES",
            "Although many different processes for developing love of Godhead have been explained so far, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b now gives us a general description of how one can best achieve such a high position. The beginning of ecstatic love of Godhead is basically faith. There are many societies and associations of pure devotees, and if someone with just a little faith begins to associate with such societies, his advancement to pure devotional service is rapid. The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to associate with him with a little faith, one gets the chance of hearing about the Lord from authoritative scriptures likeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Thus, by the mercy of the Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, one gradually develops his faith in the descriptions of such authoritative scriptures. This is the first stage of association with pure devotees. In the second stage, after one becomes a little advanced and mature, he automatically offers to follow the principles of devotional service under the guidance of the pure devotee and accepts him as the spiritual master. In the next stage, under the guidance of the spiritual master, the devotee executes regulative devotional service, and as a result of such activities, he becomes freed from all unwanted occupations. When he is freed from unwanted occupations, his faith becomes steadily fixed, and he develops a transcendental taste for devotional service, then attachment, then ecstasies, and in the last stage there is pure love of Godhead. These are the different stages of the development of pure love.",
            "Only the most fortunate persons can achieve such success in life. Those who are simply academic students of the Vedic scriptures cannot appreciate how such a development takes place. In theN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101traLord \u015aiva therefore tells P\u0101rvat\u012b, \u201cMy dear supreme goddess, you may know from me that any person who has developed the ecstasy of love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who is always merged in transcendental bliss on account of this love, cannot even perceive the material distress or happiness coming from the body or mind.\u201d",
            "The affection and the dealings of love that are different branches of the original tree of love precede many varieties of affectionate manifestations that will not be discussed here. These different manifestations have been described by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in hisBh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta.Although the subject of such affections and dealings of love is very confidential, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described them very explicitly.",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b thus concludes the first division of theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,offering up his treatise for the transcendental pleasure of San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who has established the transcendental beauty, and of Gop\u0101la Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Raghun\u0101tha Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b. It appears from this statement that the great \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was not yet active whenBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuwas written.",
            "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the first division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,up to the descriptions of ecstatic love of Godhead, which are to follow next."

            "CHAPTER TWENTY",
            "Transcendental Mellow",
            "In this second division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuthe author offers his respectful obeisances unto \u201cSan\u0101tana.\u201d This San\u0101tana can be interpreted as either \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself or as San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the elder brother and spiritual master of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b. In the case where \u201cSan\u0101tana\u201d is accepted to mean \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the obeisances are offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is naturally so beautiful and because He is the killer of the demon Agha. If it is interpreted to mean San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, then it is because he is so greatly favored by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, being always served by him, and because he is the annihilator of all kinds of sinful activities. In this division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuthe author wants to describe the general symptoms of the transcendental mellow (loving mood) of discharging devotional service.",
            "In this division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuthere are five general topics: (1)vibh\u0101va\u00a0\u2013special symptoms or causes of ecstasy, (2)anubh\u0101va\u00a0\u2013subsequent ecstasy, (3)s\u0101ttvika-bh\u0101va\u00a0\u2013constitutional or existential ecstasy, (4)vyabhic\u0101r\u012b-bh\u0101va\u00a0\u2013aggressive ecstasy and (5)sth\u0101yi-bh\u0101va\u00a0\u2013fervent or continuous ecstasy.",
            "The wordrasa,used in theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,is understood by different persons differently because the exact English equivalent is very difficult to find. But as we have seen our spiritual master translate this wordrasainto \u201cmellow,\u201d we shall follow in his footsteps and also translate the word in that way.",
            "The particular loving mood or attitude relished in the exchange of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calledrasa,or mellow. The different types ofrasa,when combined together, help one to taste the mellow of devotional service in the highest degree of transcendental ecstasy. Such a position, although entirely transcendental to our experience, will be explained in this section as far as possible, following in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b.",
            "Without relishing some sort of mellow, or loving mood, in one\u2019s activities, no one can continue to perform such activities. Similarly, in the transcendental life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service there must be some mellow, or specific taste, from the service. Generally this mellow is experienced by chanting, hearing, worshiping in the temple and being engaged in the service of the Lord. So when a person feels transcendental bliss, that is called \u201crelishing the mellow.\u201d To be more clear, we may understand that the various feelings of happiness derived from discharging devotional service may be termed the \u201cmellows\u201d of devotional service.",
            "This relishing of transcendental mellow in discharging devotional service cannot be experienced by all classes of men because this sweet loving mood is developed only from one\u2019s previous life\u2019s activities or by the association of unalloyed devotees. As explained above, association with pure devotees is the beginning of faith in devotional service. Only by developing such faith in the association of a pure devotee, or by having in one\u2019s previous life executed devotional activities, can one actually relish the mellow of devotional service. In other words, this transcendental bliss is not to be enjoyed by any common man unless he is so extraordinarily fortunate as to be in association with devotees or to be continuing his previous birth\u2019s devotional activities.",
            "The gradual process of development to the stage of devotional service is explained in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,First Canto: \u201cThe beginning is to hear about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of devotees who have themselves cleansed their hearts by association. Hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord will result in one\u2019s feeling transcendental bliss always.\u201d It is also explained inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that for one who has actually come to the spiritual platform, the first symptom visible will be that he is always joyful. This joyous life is attained by one\u2019s reaction to readingBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101or\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,or else from associating with persons who are very interested in the spiritual life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u00a0\u2013 specifically those who have made the determination to achieve the favor of Govinda by being engaged in transcendental loving service at His lotus feet. Being encouraged by such a feeling, one who is constantly engaged in discharging the regulative principles of devotional service in such a way as to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead develops two principles of compelling force, which come under the heading ofvibh\u0101va.Thus one enjoys transcendental bliss.",
            "There are several origins or causes for this compulsive love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s playing on the flute. The effect is sometimes loving and sometimes stunted.",
            "There are eight transcendental symptoms found in the body during ecstasy, and all of them are possible only by a mixture of the above-mentioned five ecstatic divisions. Without some mixture of these five ecstatic principles, one cannot relish transcendental bliss. The cause or basis for relishing transcendental mellow is exactly what we mean byvibh\u0101va.Thisvibh\u0101vais divided into two\u00a0\u2013 namely, basic and impelling, or impetus-giving. In theAgni Pur\u0101\u1e47athe description ofvibh\u0101vais given as follows: \u201cThe basis from which ecstatic love is born is calledvibh\u0101va,which is divided into two\u00a0\u2013 basic and impelling.\u201d In other words, there are two kinds of ecstatic love. The object of basic ecstatic love is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotee. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of basic ecstatic love, and His pure devotee, a reservoir of such love, is the object of impelling ecstatic love. Impelling ecstatic love, then, is that love which develops when one sees an object that reminds him of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the possessor of inconceivable potencies and qualities of transcendental knowledge and bliss, is the basic cause of ecstatic love. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also becomes the reservoir (impetus) of ecstatic love by His different incarnations and expansions. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere is a statement in connection with thebrahma-vimohana-l\u012bl\u0101which demonstrates something of this impelling or impetus-giving feature of ecstatic love. When Brahm\u0101 was deluded by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who expanded Himself into so many cowherd boys, calves and cows, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s elder brother, \u015ar\u012b Baladeva (a direct expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself), felt astonishment and said, \u201cHow wonderful it is that My ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is again being attracted to so many cowherd boys, calves and cows!\u201d He was struck with wonder by thinking in this way. This is one of the examples in which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself becomes the object and reservoir of ecstatic love in the impelling aspect."

            "Qualities of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a",
            "Personal features can be divided into two: one feature is covered and the other feature is manifested. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is covered by different kinds of dress, His personal feature is covered. There is an example of His covered personal feature in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin connection with Hisdv\u0101rak\u0101-l\u012bl\u0101(His residence in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 as its king). Sometimes Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to play by dressing Himself like a woman. Seeing this form, Uddhava said, \u201cHow wonderful it is that this woman is attracting my ecstatic love exactly as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does. I think she must be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a covered by the dress of a woman!\u201d",
            "One devotee praised the bodily features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when he saw the Lord in His manifested personal feature. He exclaimed, \u201cHow wonderful is the personal feature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! How His neck is just like a conch shell! His eyes are so beautiful, as though they themselves were encountering the beauty of a lotus flower. His body is just like thetam\u0101latree, very blackish. His head is protected with a canopy of hair. There are the marks of \u015ar\u012bvatsa on His chest, and He is holding His conch shell. By such beautiful bodily features, the enemy of the demon Madhu has appeared so pleasing that He can bestow upon me transcendental bliss simply by my seeing His transcendental qualities.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, after consulting various scriptures, has enumerated the transcendental qualities of the Lord as follows: (1) beautiful features of the entire body; (2) marked with all auspicious characteristics; (3) extremely pleasing; (4) effulgent; (5) strong; (6) ever youthful; (7) wonderful linguist; (8) truthful; (9) talks pleasingly; (10) fluent; (11) highly learned; (12) highly intelligent; (13) a genius; (14) artistic; (15) extremely clever; (16) expert; (17) grateful; (18) firmly determined; (19) an expert judge of time and circumstances; (20) sees and speaks on the authority of theVedas,or scriptures; (21) pure; (22) self-controlled; (23) steadfast; (24) forbearing; (25) forgiving; (26) grave; (27) self-satisfied; (28) possessing equilibrium; (29) magnanimous; (30) religious; (31) heroic; (32) compassionate; (33) respectful; (34) gentle; (35) liberal; (36) shy; (37) the protector of surrendered souls; (38) happy; (39) the well-wisher of devotees; (40) controlled by love; (41) all-auspicious; (42) most powerful; (43) all-famous; (44) popular; (45) partial to devotees; (46) very attractive to all women; (47) all-worshipable; (48) all-opulent; (49) all-honorable; (50) the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has all these fifty transcendental qualities in fullness as deep as the ocean. In other words, the extent of His qualities is inconceivable.",
            "As parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the individual living entities can also possess all of these qualities in minute quantities, provided they become pure devotees of the Lord. In other words, all of the above transcendental qualities can be present in the devotees in minute quantity, whereas the qualities in fullness are always present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "Besides these, there are other transcendental qualities, which are described by Lord \u015aiva to P\u0101rvat\u012b in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,and in the First Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin connection with a conversation between the deity of the earth and the king of religion, Yamar\u0101ja. It is said therein, \u201cPersons who are desirous of becoming great personalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverance, renunciation, peacefulness, simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity, equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, detachment, opulence, chivalry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster, patience, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, mannerliness, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, respectfulness and lack of false egotism.\u201d Persons who are desiring to become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so we can know for certain that these qualities are found in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme soul.",
            "Besides all of the above-mentioned fifty qualities, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a possesses five more, which are sometimes partially manifested in the persons of Lord Brahm\u0101 or Lord \u015aiva. These transcendental qualities are as follows: (51) changeless; (52) all-cognizant; (53) ever fresh; (54)sac-cid-\u0101nanda(possessing an eternal blissful body); (55) possessing all mystic perfections.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also possesses five other qualities, which are manifest in the body of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and they are listed as follows: (56) He has inconceivable potency. (57) Uncountable universes generate from His body. (58) He is the original source of all incarnations. (59) He is the giver of salvation to the enemies whom He kills. (60) He is the attractor of liberated souls. All these transcendental qualities are manifest wonderfully in the personal feature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Besides these sixty transcendental qualities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has four more, which are not manifest even in the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form of Godhead, what to speak of the demigods or living entities. They are as follows. (61) He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes (especially His childhood pastimes). (62) He is surrounded by devotees endowed with wonderful love of Godhead. (63) He can attract all living entities all over the universes by playing on His flute. (64) He has a wonderful excellence of beauty that cannot be rivaled anywhere in the creation.",
            "Adding to the list these four exceptional qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is to be understood that the aggregate number of qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sixty-four. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has attempted to give evidences from various scriptures about all sixty-four qualities present in the person of the Supreme Lord.",
            "1.\u2009\u2009BEAUTIFUL BODILY FEATURES",
            "Any comparison of the different parts of the Lord\u2019s body to different material objects cannot factually be a complete comparison. Ordinary persons, who cannot understand how exalted are the bodily features of the Lord, are simply given a chance to understand by a material comparison. It is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s face is as beautiful as the moon, His thighs are powerful just like the trunks of elephants, His arms are just like two pillars, His palms are expanded like lotus flowers, His chest is just like a doorway, His hips are dens, and the middle of His body is a terrace.",
            "2.\u2009\u2009AUSPICIOUS CHARACTERISTICS",
            "There are certain characteristics of different limbs that are considered to be very auspicious and are fully present in the body of the Lord. In this connection, one friend of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, speaking about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s auspicious bodily symptoms, said, \u201cMy dear King of the cowherds, I can find thirty-two auspicious symptoms on the body of your son! I am wondering how this boy could have taken His birth in a family of cowherd men.\u201d Generally, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears He does so in a family ofk\u1e63atriyas(kings), as did Lord R\u0101macandra, and sometimes in a family ofbr\u0101hma\u1e47as.But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepted the role of son to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged to thevai\u015byacommunity. The business of thevai\u015byacommunity is trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend, who may have been born into abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, expressed his wonder at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family ofvai\u015byas.Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the boy\u2019s foster father.",
            "He continued, \u201cThis boy has a reddish luster in seven places\u00a0\u2013 His eyes, the ends of His hands, the ends of His legs, His palate, His lips, His tongue and His nails. A reddish luster in these seven places is considered to be auspicious. Three parts of His body are very broad: His waist, forehead and chest. Three parts of His body are short: His neck, thighs and genitals. Three parts of His body are very deep: His voice, intelligence and navel. There is highness in five parts of His body: His nose, arms, ears, forehead and thighs. In five parts of His body there is fineness: His skin, the hairs on His head and on the other parts of His body, His teeth and His fingertips. The aggregate of all these bodily features is manifest only in the bodies of great personalities.\u201d",
            "The fate lines on the palm are also considered to be auspicious bodily symptoms. In this connection, one oldgop\u012binformed King Nanda, \u201cYour son possesses various wonderful fate lines on His palms. There are the signs of lotus flowers and wheels on His palms, and on His soles there are the signs of a flag, a thunderbolt, a fish, a rod for controlling elephants, and a lotus flower. Please observe how auspicious these signs are!\u201d",
            "3.\u2009\u2009PLEASING",
            "Beautiful bodily features which automatically attract the eyes are calledrucira(pleasing). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a possesses this attractive feature ofrucirain His personal features. In the Third Canto, second chapter, verse 13 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is a statement about this. \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His pleasing dress, appeared at the scene of the sacrificial arena when King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was performing the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice. All important personalities from different parts of the universe had been invited to the sacrificial arena, and all of them, upon beholding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there, considered that the Creator had ended all of His craftsmanship in the creation of this particular body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "It is said that the transcendental body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resembles the lotus flower in eight parts\u00a0\u2013 namely, His face, His two eyes, His two hands, His navel and His two feet. Thegop\u012bsand inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana used to see the luster of lotus flowers everywhere, and they could hardly withdraw their eyes from such a vision.",
            "4.\u2009\u2009EFFULGENT",
            "The effulgence pervading the universe is considered to be the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The supreme abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always throwing off the effulgence known asbrahma-jyotir,and that effulgence is emanating from His body.",
            "The luster of the hosts of jewels fixed on the chest of the Lord can defeat even the luster of the sun, and still, when compared with the bodily luster of the Lord, that crest of jewels appears to be only as bright as one of the stars in the sky. Therefore the transcendental influence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so great that it can defeat anyone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present in the sacrificial arena of His enemy King Ka\u1e41sa, the wrestlers present, although appreciating the softness of the body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, were afraid and perturbed when they thought of engaging with Him in battle.",
            "5.\u2009\u2009STRONG",
            "A person who has extraordinary bodily strength is calledbal\u012by\u0101n.When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura, some of thegop\u012bssaid, \u201cMy dear friends, just see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has killed Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura! Although he was stronger than a mountain, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a plucked him up just like a piece of cotton and threw him away without any difficulty!\u201d There is another passage wherein it is said, \u201cO my dear devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, may the left hand of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which has lifted Govardhana Hill like a ball, save you from all dangers.\u201d",
            "6.\u2009\u2009EVER YOUTHFUL",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is beautiful at His different ages\u00a0\u2013 namely, His childhood, His boyhood and His youth. Out of these three, His youth is the reservoir of all pleasures and is the time when the highest varieties of devotional service are acceptable. At that age, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full with all transcendental qualities and is engaged in His transcendental pastimes. Therefore, devotees have accepted the beginning of His youth as the most attractive feature in ecstatic love.",
            "At this age K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as follows: \u201cThe force of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s youth was combined with His beautiful smile, which defeated even the beauty of the full moon. He was always nicely dressed, in beauty surpassing even Cupid, and He was always attracting the minds of thegop\u012bs,who were thereby always feeling pleasure.\u201d",
            "7.\u2009\u2009WONDERFUL LINGUIST",
            "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that a person who knows the languages of different countries, especially the Sanskrit language, which is spoken in the cities of the demigods\u00a0\u2013 as well as other worldly languages, including those of the animals\u00a0\u2013 is called a wonderful linguist. It appears from this statement that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can also speak and understand the languages of the animals. An old woman in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, present at the time of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes, once stated in surprise, \u201cHow wonderful it is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who owns the hearts of all the young girls of Vraja-bh\u016bmi, can nicely speak the language of Vraja-bh\u016bmi with thegop\u012bs,while in Sanskrit He speaks with the demigods, and in the language of the animals He can even speak with the cows and buffalo! Similarly, in the language of the Kashmir province, and with the parrots and other birds, as well as in most common languages, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expressive!\u201d She inquired from thegop\u012bsas to how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had become so expert in speaking so many different types of languages.",
            "8.\u2009\u2009TRUTHFUL",
            "A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once promised Kunt\u012b, the mother of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, that He would bring her five sons back from the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. After the battle was finished, when all the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas had come home, Kunt\u012b praised K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because His promise was so nicely fulfilled. She said, \u201cEven the sunshine may one day become cool and the moonshine one day become hot, but still Your promise will not fail.\u201d Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, along with Bh\u012bma and Arjuna, went to challenge Jar\u0101sandha, He plainly told Jar\u0101sandha that He was the eternal K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, present along with two of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. The story is that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u00a0\u2013 in this case Bh\u012bma and Arjuna\u00a0\u2013 werek\u1e63atriyas(warrior-kings). Jar\u0101sandha was also ak\u1e63atriyaand was very charitable toward thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as.Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who had planned to fight with Jar\u0101sandha, went to him with Bh\u012bma and Arjuna in the dress ofbr\u0101hma\u1e47as.Jar\u0101sandha, being very charitable toward thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,asked them what they wanted and they expressed their desire to fight with him. Then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, dressed as abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,declared Himself to be the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who was the king\u2019s eternal enemy.",
            "9.\u2009\u2009PLEASING TALKER",
            "A person who can speak sweetly even with his enemy just to pacify him is called a pleasing talker. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was such a pleasing talker that after defeating His enemy K\u0101liya in the water of the Yamun\u0101, He said, \u201cMy dear king of the snakes, although I have given you so much pain, please do not be dissatisfied with Me. It is My duty to protect these cows, which are worshiped even by the demigods. Only in order to save them from the danger of your presence have I been obliged to banish you from this place.\u201d",
            "K\u0101liya was residing within the water of the Yamun\u0101, and as a result the back portion of that river had become poisoned. Thus so many cows who had drunk the water had died. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though He was only four or five years old, dipped Himself into the water, punished K\u0101liya very severely and then asked him to leave the place and go elsewhere.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said at that time that the cows are worshiped even by the demigods, and He practically demonstrated how to protect the cows. At least people who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should follow in His footsteps and give all protection to the cows. Cows are worshiped not only by the demigods. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself worshiped the cows on several occasions, especially on the days of Gop\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b and Govardhana-p\u016bj\u0101.",
            "10.\u2009\u2009FLUENT",
            "A person who can speak meaningful words and with all politeness and good qualities is calledv\u0101vad\u016bka,or fluent. There is a nice statement in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamregarding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s speaking politely. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a politely bade His father, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, to stop the ritualistic offering of sacrifice to the rain-god, Indra, a wife of one village cowherd man became captivated. She later thus described the speaking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to her friends: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking to His father so politely and gently that it was as if He were pouring nectar into the ears of all present there. After hearing such sweet words from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who will not be attracted to Him?\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s speech, which contains all good qualities in the universe, is described in the following statement by Uddhava: \u201cThe words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so attractive that they can immediately change the heart of even His opponent. His words can immediately solve all of the questions and problems of the world. Although He does not speak very long, each and every word from His mouth contains volumes of meaning. These speeches of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very pleasing to my heart.\u201d",
            "11.\u2009\u2009HIGHLY LEARNED",
            "When a person is highly educated and acts strictly on moral principles, he is called highly learned. A person conversant in different departments of knowledge is called educated, and because he acts on moral principles, he is called morally stout. Together, these two factors constitute learning.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s receiving education from S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni is described by \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni as follows: \u201cIn the beginning, Lord Brahm\u0101 and others are like clouds of evaporated water from the great ocean of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, Brahm\u0101 first received the Vedic education from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic education or instruction which was spoken by Brahm\u0101 to the world was then reposed upon the mountain of S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni. S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni\u2019s instructions to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are like a reservoir of water on the mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the source, the ocean of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d To be more clear, the idea is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahm\u0101 received his education from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and from Brahm\u0101, via the disciplic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same original ocean of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka, where all are born with fully developed mystic powers, and the C\u0101ra\u1e47as, the inhabitants of a similar planet, pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cMy Lord Govinda, the goddess of learning is decorated with fourteen kinds of educational ornaments, her intelligence is all-pervading within the four departments of theVedas,her attention is always on the lawbooks given by great sages like Manu, and she is appareled in six kinds of expert knowledge\u00a0\u2013 namely, Vedic evidence, grammar, astrology, rhetoric, vocabulary and logic. Her constant friends are the supplements of theVedas,thePur\u0101\u1e47as,and she is decorated with the final conclusion of all education. And now she has acquired an opportunity to sit with You as a class friend in school, and she is now engaged in Your service.\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not require any education, but He gives a chance to the goddess of learning to serve Him. Being self-sufficient, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not require the service of any living entity, although He has many devotees. It is because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind and merciful that He gives everyone the opportunity to serve Him, as though He required the service of His devotees.",
            "Regarding His moral principles, it is stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ruling over V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as death personified to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and to His opponents He is the annihilating fire generated from Lord \u015aiva. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to exhibit the highest quality of moral principles. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He deals with different kinds of persons according to their dealings with Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dealings with devotees and with nondevotees, although different, are equally good. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-good, His dealings with everyone are always good.",

As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s memory is concerned, it is said that when He was studying in the school of S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni in Avant\u012bpura, He showed such a sharp memory that by once taking instructions from the teacher He immediately became perfect in any subject. Actually, His going to the school of S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni was to show the people of the world that however great or ingenious one may be, he must go to higher authorities for general education. However great one may be, he must accept a teacher or spiritual master.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s fine discretion was exhibited when He was fighting with the untouchable king who attacked the city of Mathur\u0101. According to Vedic rites, those who are untouchable are not to be touched by thek\u1e63atriyakings, not even for killing. Therefore, when the untouchable king seized the city of Mathur\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not think it wise to kill him directly with His own hand. Still the king had to be killed, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a decided with fine discretion that He should flee from the battlefield so that the untouchable king would chase Him. He could then lead the king to the mountain where Mucukunda was lying asleep. Mucukunda had received a benediction from K\u0101rttikeya to the effect that when he awoke from his sleep, whomever he might see would at once be burnt to ashes. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought it wise to lead the untouchable king to that cave so that the king\u2019s presence would awaken Mucukunda and he would at once be burnt to ashes.",

About the expertise of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is a statement in the Tenth Canto, fifty-ninth chapter, verse 17 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,wherein \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cO best of the Kurus, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cut to pieces all the different weapons used by different fighters.\u201d Formerly, fighting was done by releasing different kinds of arrows. One party would release a certain arrow, and the other party had to defeat it by counteracting it with another arrow. For example, one party might release an arrow that would cause water to pour from the sky, and to counteract this the opposing party would have to release an arrow that could immediately turn the water into clouds. So from this statement it appears that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was very expert in counteracting the enemy\u2019s arrows. Similarly, at ther\u0101sadance, each and everygop\u012brequested that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a individually become her partner, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately expanded Himself into so many K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as in order to be coupled with each and everygop\u012b.The result was that eachgop\u012bfound K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by her side.",

So to anyone who is constantly engaged in addressing the Lord and His energy, we can imagine how much the Supreme Lord is obliged. It is impossible for the Lord to ever forget such a devotee. It is clearly stated in this verse that anyone who addresses the Lord immediately attracts the attention of the Lord, who always remains obliged to him.",

As far as the Lord\u2019s determination is concerned, there is an example in His dealings in theHari-va\u1e41\u015ba.This is in connection with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s fighting the king of heaven, Indra, who was forcibly deprived of thep\u0101rij\u0101taflower.P\u0101rij\u0101tais a kind of lotus flower grown on the heavenly planets. Once, Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, one of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s queens, wanted that lotus flower, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a promised to deliver it; but Indra refused to part with hisp\u0101rij\u0101taflower. Therefore there was a great fight, with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas on one side and all of the demigods on the other. Ultimately, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a defeated all of them and took thep\u0101rij\u0101taflower, which He presented to His queen. So, in regard to that occurrence, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told N\u0101rada Muni, \u201cMy dear great sage of the demigods, now you can declare to the devotees in general, and to the nondevotees in particular, that in this matter of taking thep\u0101rij\u0101taflower, all the demigods\u00a0\u2013 the Gandharvas, the N\u0101gas, the demon R\u0101k\u1e63asas, the Yak\u1e63as, the Pannagas\u00a0\u2013 tried to defeat Me, but none could make Me break My promise to My queen.\u201d",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, protected all of the citizens and animals of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by lifting Govardhana Hill, which served as an umbrella. After the incident was over, Indra surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with many prayers, in which he admitted, \u201cBy Your lifting Govardhana Hill and protecting the citizens of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, You have kept Your promise that Your devotees are never to be vanquished.\u201d",

Actually, any man of knowledge and experience should see everything through these books. For example, with our naked eye we perceive the sun globe simply as some glaring substance, but when we see through authorized books of science and other literature, we can understand how much greater the sun globe is than this earth and how powerful it is. So seeing things through the naked eye is not actually seeing. Seeing things through the authorized books or authorized teachers is the correct way to see. So, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can see all that is past, present and future, to teach the people in general He used to always refer to the scriptures. For example, inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking as the supreme authority, He still mentioned and quotedVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraas authority.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme deliverer among all deliverers.

This was certainly an insult to the universal mother, S\u012bt\u0101, and Lord R\u0101macandra was immediately prepared to kill the crow. But because later on the crow bowed down before the Lord, the Lord excused his offense. \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya further says in his prayer that the forgiving power of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is even greater than that of Lord R\u0101macandra, because \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was always in the habit of insulting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 not only in one lifetime but continually throughout three lives. Still, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was so kind that He gave \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la the salvation of merging into His existence. From this we can understand that the goal of the monist to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme is not a very difficult problem. Persons like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la who are consistently inimical to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can also get this liberation.",
            "26.\u2009\u2009GRAVE",
            "A person who does not express his mind to everyone, or whose mental activity and plan of action are very difficult to understand, is called grave. After Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been offended by Brahm\u0101, Brahm\u0101 prayed to Him to be excused. But in spite of his offering nice prayers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 could not understand whether K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was satisfied or still dissatisfied. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was so grave that He did not take the prayers of Brahm\u0101 very seriously. Another instance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s gravity is found in connection with His love affairs with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was always very silent about His love affairs with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, so much so that Baladeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s elder brother and constant companion, could not understand the transformations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on account of His gravity.",

            "An example of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s self-satisfaction was exhibited when He, Arjuna and Bh\u012bma went to challenge Jar\u0101sandha, the formidable king of Magadha, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave all credit to Bh\u012bma for the killing of Jar\u0101sandha. From this we can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never cares at all for fame, although no one can be more famous.",
            "An example of His not being disturbed was shown when \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la began to call Him ill names.

            "An example of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s equilibrium is given in the Tenth Canto, sixteenth chapter, verse 33 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin connection with His chastising K\u0101liya, the hundred-headed serpent. While K\u0101liya was being severely punished, all of his wives appeared before the Lord and prayed as follows: \u201cDear Lord, You have descended to punish all kinds of demoniac living creatures. Our husband, this K\u0101liya, is a greatly sinful creature, and so Your punishment of him is quite appropriate. We know that Your punishment of Your enemies and Your dealings with Your sons are both the same. We know that it is in thinking of the future welfare of this condemned creature that You have chastised him.\u201d",
            "In another prayer it is said, \u201cMy dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, best of all the Kuru dynasty, You are so impartial that if even Your enemy is qualified, You will reward him; and if one of Your sons is a culprit, You will chastise him. This is Your business, because You are the supreme author of the universes. You have no partiality. If anyone finds any partiality in Your characteristics, he is surely mistaken.\u201d",

            "Any person who is very charitably disposed is called magnanimous.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was reigning over Dv\u0101rak\u0101, He was so magnanimous and charitably disposed that there was no limit to His charity. In fact, so great was His charity in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 that even the spiritual kingdom, with all of its opulence ofcint\u0101ma\u1e47i(touchstone), desire trees andsurabhicows, was surpassed. In the spiritual kingdom of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, named Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, there aresurabhicows that give unlimited quantities of milk. There are desire trees from which anyone can take all kinds of fruits, as much as he may desire. The land is made of touchstone, which when touched to iron will transform it into gold. In other words, although in the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything is wonderfully opulent, still when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 His charity exceeded the opulences of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Wherever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present, the limitless opulence of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is automatically present.",
            "It is also stated that while Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was living in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 He expanded Himself into 16,108 forms, and each and every expansion resided in a palace with a queen. Not only was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a happily living with His queens in those palaces, but He was giving in charity from each palace an aggregate number of 13,054 cows completely decorated with nice clothing and ornaments. From each of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s 16,108 palaces, these cows were given daily. This means that 13,054 multiplied by 16,108 cows were being given in charity by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a every day. No one can estimate the value of such a large number of cows given in charity, but that was the system of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s daily affairs while He was reigning in Dv\u0101rak\u0101.",

Simply professing a kind of faith is not a sign of religiousness. One must act according to religious principles, and by his personal example he should teach others. Such a person is to be understood as religious.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this planet, there was no irreligion. In this connection, N\u0101rada Muni once addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a jokingly, \u201cMy dear Lord of the cowherd boys, Your bulls [bulls are the representation of religion], while eating grass from the pasturing ground and moving on their four legs, have certainly eaten up all the grass of irreligion!\u201d In other words, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, religious principles were so well cared for that hardly any irreligious activities could be found.",
            "It is said that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was constantly performing various types of sacrifices and was inviting the demigods from the higher planetary systems, the demigods were almost always absent from their consorts. Therefore the wives of the demigods, regretting the absence of their husbands, began to pray for the appearance of Lord Buddha, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s ninth incarnation, who appears in the age of Kali. In other words, instead of being pleased that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had come, they began to pray for Lord Buddha, who is the ninth incarnation, because Lord Buddha stopped the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices recommended in theVedasin order to discourage animal-killing. The demigods\u2019 wives thought that if Lord Buddha appeared, all kinds of sacrifices would be stopped and thus their husbands would not be invited to such ceremonies and would not be separated from them.",
            "Sometimes it is inquired, \u201cWhy don\u2019t the demigods from higher planetary systems come to this earth planet nowadays?\u201d The plain answer is that since Lord Buddha appeared and began to deprecate the performance of sacrifice in order to stop animal-killing on this planet, the process of offering sacrifices has been stopped, and the demigods do not care to come here anymore."

            "A person who is very enthusiastic in military activities and expert in releasing different kinds of weapons is called heroic.",
            "Regarding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s heroism in fighting, there is the following statement: \u201cMy dear killer of the enemy, just as the elephant while taking bath in the lake destroys all the lotus stems within the water by swinging its trunk, so simply by moving Your arms, which are compared to the trunks of elephants, You have killed so many lotuslike enemies.\u201d",
            "Regarding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expertise in releasing weapons, when Jar\u0101sandha and thirteen divisions of soldiers attacked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s army, they were unable to hurt even one soldier on the side of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This was due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expert military training. This is unique in the history of military art.",
            "32.\u2009\u2009COMPASSIONATE",
            "A person who is unable to bear another\u2019s distress is called compassionate.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion for distressed persons was exhibited when He released all of the kings imprisoned by Magadhendra. While dying, Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and described Him as the sun that eradicated darkness. The kings imprisoned by Magadhendra were put into dark cells, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared there the darkness immediately disappeared, just as if the sun had risen. In other words, although Magadhendra was able to imprison so many kings, upon the appearance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they were all released. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a released the kings out of His sincere compassion for them.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion was also exhibited when Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma was lying on the bed of arrows which had been shot through his body. While lying in this position, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma was very anxious to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared there. Upon seeing the pitiable condition of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began speaking with tears in His eyes. Not only was He shedding tears, but He also forgot Himself in His compassion. Therefore, instead of offering obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, devotees offer obeisances to His compassionate nature. Actually, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is very difficult to approach Him. But the devotees, taking advantage of His compassionate nature, which is represented by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, always pray to R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion.",

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he was attempting to get down from his chariot to receive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But before Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira could get down, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a got down from His own chariot and immediately fell at the feet of the king.

All of thegop\u012bswere observing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s wonderful achievement, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was also smiling at seeing thegop\u012bs.When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance went over the breasts of thegop\u012bs,His hand began to shake, and upon seeing His hand shake, all of the cowherd men underneath the hill became a little disturbed. Then there was a tumultuous roaring sound, and they all began to pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for safety. At this time Lord Balar\u0101ma was smiling, thinking that these cowherd men had been frightened by the shaking of Govardhana Hill. But, seeing Balar\u0101ma smile, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought that Balar\u0101ma had understood His mind in observing the breasts of thegop\u012bs,and He immediately became bashful.",

The constant dancing before the doors of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s palaces was not to be imagined even by the demigods in the heavenly kingdom. In the heavenly kingdom, Indra always sees the dancing of the society girls. But even Indra could not imagine how beautiful were the dances being performed at the gates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s palaces.Gaur\u012bmeans \u201cwhite woman,\u201d and Lord \u015aiva\u2019s wife is called Gaur\u012b. The beautiful women residing within the palaces of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were so much whiter than Gaur\u012b that they were compared to the moonshine, and they were constantly visible to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, no one can be enjoying more than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conception of enjoyment is beautiful women, ornaments and riches. And all of these were fabulously present in the palaces of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, defeating even the imagination of Kuvera, Lord Indra or Lord \u015aiva.",
            "Not even a slight distress can touch K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Once some of thegop\u012bswent to the place where thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere performing sacrifices and said, \u201cDear wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,you must know that not even a slight smell of distress can touch K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He knows no loss, He knows no defamation, He has no fear, He has no anxiety, and He does not know calamity.

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s favoritism toward His devotees was exhibited in His fight with Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. When Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma was lying at the point of death on the bed of arrows, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present before him and Bh\u012b\u1e63ma was remembering how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been kind to him on the battlefield. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had promised that in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra He would not even touch a weapon to help either side; He would remain neutral. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was Arjuna\u2019s charioteer, He had promised that He would not help Arjuna by using any weapons. But one day Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, in order to nullify K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s promise, exhibited his fighting spirit so magnificently against Arjuna that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was obliged to get down from His chariot. Taking up a broken chariot wheel, He ran toward Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma as a lion runs toward an elephant to kill it. Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma remembered this scene, and He later praised K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for His glorious favoritism toward His devotee, Arjuna, even at the risk of breaking His own promise.",

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes obliged to the loving spirit of the devotee and not exactly to the service rendered. No one can serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely. He is so complete and self-sufficient that He has no need of any service from the devotee. It is the devotee\u2019s attitude of love and affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that makes Him obliged. A very nice example of this obligatory behavior was manifested when Sud\u0101m\u0101 Vipra went to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s palace. Sud\u0101m\u0101 Vipra had been a class friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, and due to his poverty he was induced by his wife to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to request some aid.

Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 brought some rope from the house and tried to tie up the child, but she could not tie a knot due to the shortness of the rope. She tied together many ropes, but when she finished still the rope was too short. After a while she felt very tired and began to perspire. At that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a agreed to be bound up by His mother. In other words, no one can bind K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by any means other than love.

In the First Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 38 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated that the special prerogative of the supreme controller is that He is not at all affected by the modes of nature. The practical example of this is that devotees who are under the protection of the Lord are also not affected by material nature. To overcome the influence of the material nature is very difficult, but the devotees or the saintly persons who are under the protection of the Lord are not affected.

Knowing Duryodhana\u2019s plan, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and asked their wife, Draupad\u012b, if there were any remnants of food that she could offer to Him. Draupad\u012b offered Him a container in which there was only a little fragment of some vegetable preparation, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once ate it. At that moment all of the sages accompanying Durv\u0101s\u0101 were taking bath in the river, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a felt satisfaction from eating Draupad\u012b\u2019s offering, they also felt satisfaction, and their hunger was gone. Because Durv\u0101s\u0101 and his men were unable to eat anything more, they went away without coming into the house of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. In this way the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were saved from the wrath of Durv\u0101s\u0101.

While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was talking with Kunt\u012b, He simultaneously entered the womb of Uttar\u0101, who was in danger due to the atomic weapon of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can illusion even Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, and He can protect all surrendered devotees from the reactions of sinful activities. These are some of the examples of His inconceivable potencies.",

He has taught millions of Brahm\u0101s self-realization, and thus He is worshipable not only by the heads of all universes, but by everyone else also.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately ordered Yamar\u0101ja, \u201cBe benefited by My order and return that soul unto Me!\u201d The purport of this incident is that even a person who is under the regulative principles of the laws of nature, and who is therefore punishable by Yamar\u0101ja under these laws, can be granted complete immunity by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

The wordpa-vargaindicates the combination of five Sanskrit letters:pa, pha, ba, bhaandma.These letters are the first letters of the words for five different conditions as described below. The first letter,pa,comes from the wordpar\u0101bhava,which means \u201cdefeat.\u201d In this material struggle for existence, we are simply meeting defeat. Actually, we have to conquer birth, death, disease and old age, and because there is no possibility of overcoming all these miserable conditions, due to the illusion ofm\u0101y\u0101we are simply meeting withpar\u0101bhava,or defeat. The next letter,pha,is taken from the wordphena. Phenais the foam which is found on the mouth when one is very tired (as is commonly observed with horses). The letterbacomes from the wordbandha,or bondage.Bhais taken from the wordbh\u012bti,or fearfulness.Mais taken from the wordm\u1e5bti,or death.

In other words, they entered into the Brahman effulgence. The example of the sun planet is given here because the sun is ever-illuminating, like the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable illuminating Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were killed, and instead of penetrating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s phalanx, they entered into the friendly atmosphere of the spiritual effulgence.

            "A person is calleddh\u012bra-lalitaif he is naturally very funny, always in full youthfulness, expert in joking and free from all anxieties. Such adh\u012bra-lalitapersonality is generally found to be domesticated and very submissive to his lover. Thisdh\u012bra-lalitatrait in the personality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described by Yaj\u00f1a-patn\u012b, the wife of one of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho were performing sacrifices in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. She tells her friends, \u201cOne day \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, accompanied by Her associates, was taking rest in Her garden, and at that time Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arrived in that assembly. After sitting down, He began to narrate very impudently about His previous night\u2019s pastimes with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. While He was speaking in that way, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became very embarrassed. She was feeling ashamed and was absorbed in thought, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took the opportunity to mark Her breasts with different kinds oftilaka.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proved Himself to be very expert in that art.\u201d In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, asdh\u012bra-lalita,was enjoying His youthful proclivities in the company of thegop\u012bs.",
            "Generally, those who are expert in writing drama choose to call Cupid the idealdh\u012bra-lalita,but we can more perfectly find in the personality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a all the characteristics ofdh\u012bra-lalita.",
            "DH\u012aRA-PRA\u015a\u0100NTA",
            "A person who is very peaceful, forbearing, considerate and obliging is calleddh\u012bra-pra\u015b\u0101nta.Thisdh\u012bra-pra\u015b\u0101ntatrait of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was exhibited in His dealings with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. On account of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 faithful devotion to the Lord, He agreed to become their charioteer, their advisor, their friend, their messenger and sometimes their bodyguard. Such is an example of the result of devotional service toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira about religious principles, He demonstrated Himself to be a great learned scholar, but because He accepted the position of younger cousin to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, He was speaking in a very gentle tone, which enhanced His beautiful bodily features. The movements of His eyes and the mode of His speech proved that He was very, very expert in giving moral instruction. Sometimes, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira is also accepted by learned scholars asdh\u012bra-pra\u015b\u0101nta.",
            "DH\u012aRODDHATA",
            "A person who is very envious, proud, easily angered, restless and complacent is calleddh\u012broddhataby learned scholars. Such qualities were visible in the character of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because when He was writing a letter to K\u0101layavana, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a addressed him as a sinful frog. In His letter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised K\u0101layavana that he should immediately go and find some dark well for his residence because there was a black snake named K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who was very eager to devour all such sinful frogs. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reminded K\u0101layavana that He could turn all the universes to ashes simply by looking at them.",
            "The above statement by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a seems apparently to be of an envious nature, but according to different pastimes, places and times this quality is accepted as a great characteristic. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sdh\u012broddhataqualities have been accepted as great because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a uses them only to protect His devotees. In other words, even undesirable traits may also be used in the exchange of devotional service.",
            "Sometimes Bh\u012bma, the second brother of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, is also described asdh\u012broddhata.",
            "Once, while fighting with a demon who was appearing as a deer, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a challenged him in this way: \u201cI have come before you as a great elephant named K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. You must leave the battlefield, accepting defeat, or else there is death awaiting you.\u201d This challenging spirit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is not contradictory to His sublime character; because He is the Supreme Being, everything is possible in His character.",
            "There is a nice statement in theK\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47aabout these contradictory traits of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated there that the Supreme Person is neither very fat nor very thin; He is always transcendental to material qualities, and yet His bodily luster is blackish. His eyes are reddish, He is all-powerful, and He is equipped with all different kinds of opulences. Contradictory traits in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s person are not at all surprising; one should not consider the characteristics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be actually contradictory. One should try to understand the traits of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities and try to understand how these characteristics are employed by the supreme will of the Lord.",
            "In theMah\u0101-var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is confirmed that the transcendental bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His expansions are all existing eternally. Such bodies are never material; they are completely spiritual and full of knowledge. They are reservoirs of all transcendental qualities. In theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-y\u0101mala-tantrathere is a statement that because the Personality of Godhead and His expanded bodies are always full of knowledge, bliss and eternity, they are always free from the eighteen kinds of material contaminations\u00a0\u2013 illusion, fatigue, errors, roughness, material lust, restlessness, pride, envy, violence, disgrace, exhaustion, untruth, anger, hankering, dependence, desire to lord over the universe, seeing duality and cheating.",
            "Regarding all of the above-mentioned statements, it is understood that the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the source of all incarnations in the material world. But because of His greater, extraordinary opulence, we can understand that the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the source of the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u also. This is confirmed in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,wherein it is stated, \u201cLet me offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, whose partial representation is the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d The gigantic form of the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the source of generation for innumerable universes. Innumerable universes are coming out of His exhaling breath, and the same universes are going back in with His inhaling breath. This Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u is also a plenary portion of a portion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "After describing the different opulences of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b tries to further describe the transcendental beauties and qualities of the Lord as decorated, enjoying, pleasing, dependable, steady and predominating. He is also described as a meticulous dresser and a magnanimous personality. These are generally considered to be the qualities of great personalities.",
            "DECORATED",
            "It is said that a person is great if he is decorated with the qualities of being very merciful toward the unfortunate, very powerful, superior, chivalrous, enthusiastic, expert and truthful. These decorations were manifested in the character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a during Hisgovardhana-l\u012bl\u0101.At that time the whole tract of land in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana was being disturbed by the rains sent by Indra, as described elsewhere. At first K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought, \u201cLet Me retaliate against this vengeance of Indra by destroying his heavenly kingdom,\u201d but later on, when He thought of the insignificance of the king of heaven, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changed His mind and felt merciful toward Indra. No one is able to tolerate the wrath of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so instead of retaliating against Indra, He simply showed His compassion for His friends in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by lifting the whole of Govardhana Hill to protect them.",
            "ENJOYING",
            "When a person is seen to be always happy and is accustomed to speak smilingly, he is considered to be in the mode of enjoyment. This trait was found in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He appeared at the sacrificial arena of King Ka\u1e41sa. It is described that the lotus-eyed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered among the wrestlers without being impolite to them, glanced over them with determination and seemed to them just like an elephant attacking some plants. Even while speaking to them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was still smiling, and in this way He stood valiantly upon the wrestling dais.",
            "PLEASING",
            "When one\u2019s characteristics are very sweet and desirable, his personality is called pleasing. An example of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pleasing nature is thus described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\u201cOne day while K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was awaiting the arrival of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b by the bank of the Yamun\u0101, He began to make a garland ofkadambaflowers. In the meantime, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b appeared there, and at that time Mur\u0101ri [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], the enemy of Mura, glanced over R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b very sweetly.\u201d",
            "DEPENDABLE",
            "Any person who is reliable in all circumstances is called dependable. In this connection R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that even the demons were relying upon the dependability of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they were confident that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would never attack them without due cause. Therefore, with faith and confidence, they used to live with their doors wide open. And the demigods, although afraid of the demons, were confident of the protection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, even in the midst of danger they were engaged in sportive activities. Persons who had never undergone the reformatory ritualistic ceremonies of theVedaswere confident that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would accept only faith and devotion, and so they were engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and were freed from all anxieties. In other words, all kinds of men, from the demigods down to the uncultured, can rely on the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.",
            "STEADY",
            "A person who is not disturbed even in a situation of reverses is called steady. This steadiness was observed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in connection with His chastising the demon known as B\u0101\u1e47a. The B\u0101\u1e47a demon had many hands, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was cutting off these hands one after another. This B\u0101\u1e47a was a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva and the goddess Durg\u0101. Thus, when B\u0101\u1e47a was being chastised, Lord \u015aiva and Durg\u0101 became very furious at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not care for them.",
            "PREDOMINATING",
            "A person who can affect the mind of everyone is called predominating. As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s predomination is concerned, in the Tenth Canto, forty-third chapter, verse 17 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described thus by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to King Par\u012bk\u1e63it: \u201cMy dear King, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a thunderbolt to the wrestlers; to the common man He is the most beautiful human being; to the young girls He is just like Cupid; to the cowherd men and women He is the most intimate relative; to the impious kings He is the supreme ruler; to His parents, Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101, He is just a baby; to Ka\u1e41sa, the king of Bhoja, He is death personified; to the dull and stupid He is just like a stone; to theyog\u012bsHe is the Supreme Absolute Truth; and to the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a predominating position, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in that arena along with His older brother, Balar\u0101ma.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the reservoir of all mellows, was present in the arena of Ka\u1e41sa, He appeared differently to the different persons who were related to Him in different mellows. It is stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that He appears to every person according to one\u2019s relationship with Him.",
            "Sometimes learned scholars describe \u201cpredominating\u201d to mean a person intolerant of being neglected. This peculiarity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was visible when Ka\u1e41sa was insulting Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda. Vasudeva was asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s assistance in killing Ka\u1e41sa, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was glancing over Ka\u1e41sa with longing eyes, just like a prostitute, and was just preparing to jump at the king.",
            "METICULOUS DRESSER",
            "A person who is very fond of dressing himself is calledlalita,or a meticulous dresser. This characteristic was found in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in two ways: sometimes He used to decorate \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b with various marks, and sometimes, when He was preparing to kill demons like Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura, He would take care to arrange His belt very nicely.",
            "MAGNANIMOUS",
            "Persons who can give themselves to anyone are called magnanimous. No one could be more magnanimous than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is always prepared to give Himself completely to His devotee. Even to one who is not a devotee, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His form of Lord Caitanya is prepared to give Himself and to grant deliverance.",
            "Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is independent of everyone, out of His causeless mercy He is dependent upon Garga \u1e5a\u1e63i for religious instruction; for learning the military art He is dependent upon S\u0101tyaki; and for good counsel He is dependent upon His friend Uddhava."

            "CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE",
            "Devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a",
            "A person who is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that all the transcendental qualities discussed previously are also found in the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be classified into two groups: those who are cultivating devotional service in order to enter into the transcendental kingdom and those who are already in the perfectional stage of devotional service.",
            "A person who has attained the stage of attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who is not freed from the material impasse, but who has qualified himself to enter into the kingdom of God, is called as\u0101dhaka. S\u0101dhakameans one who is cultivating devotion in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The description of such a devotee is found in the Eleventh Canto, second chapter, verse 46 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.It is said there that a person who has unflinching faith in and love for the Personality of Godhead, who is in friendship with devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who is very merciful to the ignorant, raising them to the standard of devotional service, and who is uninterested in nondevotees, is considered to be situated in the position of cultivating devotional service.",
            "When one is found shedding tears by hearing of the pastimes of the Lord, it is to be understood that the blazing fire of material existence will be extinguished by such watering. When there is shivering of the body and the hairs of the body stand up, it is to be understood that the devotee is nearing perfection. An example of as\u0101dhakacultivating devotional service is Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura.",
            "When a devotee is never tired of executing devotional service and is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, constantly relishing the transcendental mellows in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is called perfect. This perfectional stage can be achieved in two ways: one may achieve this stage of perfection by gradual progress in devotional service, or one may become perfect by the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though he has not executed all the details of devotional service.",
            "There is the following nice statement in the Third Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 25 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,describing a devotee who achieves perfection by regularly executing devotional service: A person who is freed from the false egotism of material existence, or an advanced mystic, is eligible to enter into the kingdom of God, known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Such a mystic becomes so joyful by constant execution of the regulative principles of devotional service that he thereby achieves the special favor of the Supreme Lord. Yamar\u0101ja, the mighty superintendent of death, is afraid to go near such a devotee; so we can imagine the potency of advanced devotional service, especially when devotees sit together and engage in talking of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those devotees express their feelings in such a way that they automatically melt with ecstasy, and many transcendental symptoms become manifested in their bodies. Anyone desiring advancement in devotional service must follow in the footsteps of such devotees.",
            "Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that no one can attain the perfectional stage of devotional service without bowing down before exalted devotees. Learned sages like M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya \u1e5a\u1e63i attained perfection in devotional service simply by executing such regulative principles of service.",
            "A person\u2019s achieving perfection in devotional service simply by the causeless mercy of the Lord is explained in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin connection with thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asand their wives who were engaged in performingyaj\u00f1a,or sacrifice. When the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere favored by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and immediately attained the ecstasy of love of Godhead, their husbands said, \u201cHow wonderful it is that although these women have undertaken no reformatory performances such as accepting the sacred thread, have not resided in the monasteries of the spiritual master, have not observed the strict principles of celibacy, have not undergone any austerities and have not philosophized upon the observance of ritualistic ceremonies, they still have attained the favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is aspired after even by great mystics! How wonderful it is that these women have attained such perfection, while we, althoughbr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho have performed all the reformatory activities, cannot attain to this advanced stage!\u201d",
            "There is a similar statement by N\u0101rada, addressed to \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cMy dear \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, you never took the trouble to reside under the care of a spiritual master, and yet you have attained such a great status of transcendental knowledge. You never took the trouble to undergo severe austerities, and still, how wonderful it is that you have been situated in the most perfect stage of love of Godhead.\u201d",
            "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asperformingyaj\u00f1aare vivid examples of devotees who achieved the perfectional stage of devotional service by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "ETERNAL PERFECTION",
            "Persons who have achieved eternal, blissful life exactly on the level of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who are able to attract Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their transcendental loving service, are called eternally perfect. The technical name isnitya-siddha.There are two classes of living entities\u00a0\u2013 namely,nitya-siddhaandnitya-baddha.The distinction is that thenitya-siddhasare eternally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious without any forgetfulness, whereas thenitya-baddhas,or eternally conditioned souls, are forgetful of their relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The position of thenitya-siddhasis explained in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ain connection with the narration of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and Satyabh\u0101m\u0101-dev\u012b. The Lord tells Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, \u201cMy dear Satyabh\u0101m\u0101-dev\u012b, I have descended to this earthly planet by the request of Lord Brahm\u0101 and other demigods. Those who are born into this family of Yadu are all My eternal associates. My dear wife, you should not consider that My associates are ever separated from Me; they are My personal expansions, and as such, you must know that they are almost as powerful as I am. Because of their transcendental qualities, they are very, very dear to Me, as I am very, very dear to them.\u201d Anyone who becomes exhilarated by hearing of the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He was present on this earth with His associates is to be understood asnitya-siddha,eternally perfect.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 32 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere is this statement: \u201cHow wonderful are the fortunate residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, such as Nanda and the other cowherd men. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman, has actually become their intimate friend!\u201d",
            "A similar statement is there in the Tenth Canto, twenty-sixth chapter, verse 10 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lifted Govardhana Hill, the cowherd men, under the protection of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, became struck with wonder and went to Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and inquired from him, \u201cMy dear Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, how is it that we are so intensely attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also so affectionately attached to us? Does it mean that He is the Supersoul of everyone?\u201d",

As the Lord descends by His causeless mercy upon this planet, so, in order to help in the pastimes of the Lord, these devotees also come here. They are not ordinary living entities or conditioned souls; they are ever-liberated persons, associates of the Personality of Godhead. And just as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a behaves like an ordinary man when He descends to this planet, so the members of the Yadu dynasty and the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana execute activities just like ordinary men. But they are not ordinary men; they are as liberated as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.",
            "In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0dasection, it is stated, \u201cJust as Lord R\u0101macandra descends along with Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a [an expansion of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a] and Bharata [an expansion of Pradyumna], so the members of the Yadu dynasty and the cowherd men of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana also descend with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to join in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. When the Supreme Lord returns to His eternal abode, His associates return with Him to their respective places. As such, these ever-liberated Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are not bound by the material laws of birth and death.\u201d",
            "As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101by the Lord Himself, His birth, deeds and activities are all transcendental. Similarly, the birth, deeds and activities of the associates of the Lord are also transcendental. And as it is an offense to consider oneself to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so it is offensive to consider oneself to be Ya\u015bod\u0101, Nanda or any other associate of the Lord. We should always remember that they are transcendental; they are never conditioned souls.",
            "It is described that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, has sixty-four transcendental qualities, and all of the ever-liberated souls who accompany the Lord have the first fifty-five of the qualities, without any doubt. Such devotees are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any of five transcendental mellows\u00a0\u2013 namely, neutrality, servitorship, friendship, parenthood and conjugal love. These relationships with the Lord are eternal, and thereforenitya-siddhadevotees do not have to strive to attain the perfectional stage by executing regulative devotional principles. They are eternally qualified to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "Stimulation for Ecstatic Love",
            "Some things that give impetus or stimulation to ecstatic love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are His transcendental qualities, His uncommon activities, His smiling features, His apparel and garlands, His flute, His buffalo horn, His leg bells, His conch shell, His footprints, His places of pastimes (such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana), His favorite plant (tulas\u012b), His devotee and the periodical occasions for remembering Him. One such occasion for remembrance is Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, which comes twice a month on the eleventh day of the moon, both waning and waxing. On that day all the devotees remain fasting throughout the night and continuously chant the glories of the Lord.",
            "K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A\u2019S TRANSCENDENTAL QUALITIES, HIS UNCOMMON ACTIVITIES AND HIS SMILE",
            "As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental qualities are concerned, they can be divided into three groups: qualities pertaining to His transcendental body, qualities pertaining to His transcendental speech and qualities pertaining to His transcendental mind.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s age, His transcendental bodily features, His beauty and His mildness are qualities pertaining to His body. There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His body, and therefore the transcendental features pertaining to His body are the same as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. But because these qualities stimulate the devotee\u2019s ecstatic love, they have been analyzed as separate causes of that love. To be attracted by the qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means to be attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, because there is no real distinction between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His qualities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s fame is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entourage is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and everything related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that gives stimulation to love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but for our understanding these items may be considered separately.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasure. Therefore, the impetuses to love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although seemingly different, are not actually distinct from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. In the technical Sanskrit terms, such qualities as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name and fame are accepted both as reservoirs of and as stimulation for love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s age is considered in three periods: from His appearance day to the end of His fifth year is calledkaum\u0101ra,from the beginning of the sixth year up to the end of the tenth year is calledpauga\u1e47\u1e0da,and from the eleventh to the end of the fifteenth year is calledkai\u015bora.After the beginning of the sixteenth year, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called ayauvana,or a youth, and this continues with no change.",
            "As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental pastimes are concerned, they are mostly executed during thekaum\u0101ra, pauga\u1e47\u1e0daandkai\u015boraperiods. His affectionate pastimes with His parents are executed during Hiskaum\u0101raage. His friendship with the cowherd boys is exhibited during thepauga\u1e47\u1e0daperiod. And His friendship with thegop\u012bsis exhibited during the age ofkai\u015bora.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are finished by the end of His fifteenth year, and then He is transferred to Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where all other pastimes are performed.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives us a vivid description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the reservoir of all pleasure in hisBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.Here are some parts of that description.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019skai\u015boraage may be divided into three parts. In the beginning of Hiskai\u015boraage\u00a0\u2013 that is, at the beginning of His eleventh year\u00a0\u2013 the luster of His body becomes so bright that it becomes an impetus for ecstatic love. Similarly, there are reddish borders around His eyes and a growth of soft hairs on His body. In describing this early stage of Hiskai\u015boraage, Kundalat\u0101, one of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, said to her friend, \u201cMy dear friend, I have just seen an extraordinary beauty appearing in the person of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His blackish bodily hue appears just like theindran\u012blajewel. There are reddish signs on His eyes, and small soft hairs are coming out on His body. The appearance of these symptoms has made Him extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d",
            "In this connection, in the Tenth Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 5 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, I shall try to describe how the minds of thegop\u012bsbecame absorbed in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thegop\u012bswould meditate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dressing Himself just like a dancing actor and entering the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, marking the ground with His footprints. They meditated on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s having a helmet with a peacock feather and wearing earrings on His ears and yellow-gold colored garments covered with jewels and pearls. They also meditated on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s blowing His flute and on all the cowherd boys\u2019 singing of the glories of the Lord.\u201d That is the description of the meditation that thegop\u012bsused to perform.",
            "Sometimes thegop\u012bswould think about His soft nails, His moving eyebrows and His teeth, which were catechu-colored from chewing pan. One description was given by agop\u012bto her friend: \u201cMy dear friend, just see how the enemy of Agha has assumed such wonderful features! His brows are just like the bow of Cupid, and they are moving just as though they were dancing. The tips of His nails are so soft\u00a0\u2013 it is as if they were dried bamboo leaves. His teeth are reddish, and so it appears that He has assumed a feature of anger. Under the circumstances, where is the chance for a young girl not to be attracted by such beautiful features and not to be afraid of becoming a victim to such beauty?\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attractive features are also described by V\u1e5bnd\u0101, thegop\u012bafter whom V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana was named. She told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear M\u0101dhava, Your newly invented smile has so captivated the hearts of thegop\u012bsthat they are simply unable to express themselves! As such, they have become bewildered and will not talk with others. All of thesegop\u012bshave become so affected that it is as if they had offered three sprinkles of water upon their lives. In other words, they have given up all hope for their living condition.\u201d According to the Indian system, when a person is dead there is a sprinkling of water on the body. Thus, the statement of V\u1e5bnd\u0101 shows that thegop\u012bswere so enchanted by the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that because they could not express their minds, they had decided to commit suicide.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arrived at the age of thirteen to fourteen years, His two arms and chest assumed an unspeakable beauty, and His whole form became simply enchanting. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attained thirteen years of age, His two thighs were challenging the trunks of elephants, His rising chest was trying to come to peace talks with doors of jewels, and His two arms were minimizing the value of the bolts found on doors. Who can describe the wonderful beauty of these features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? The special beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body was His mild smiling, His restless eyes and His world-enchanting songs. These are the special features of this age.",
            "There is a statement in this connection that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, on arriving at this age, manifested such beautiful bodily features that His restless eyes became the playthings of Cupid and His mild smile resembled the newly grown lotus flower. The enchanting vibration of His songs became a great impediment to the young girls, who were supposed to remain chaste and faithful to their husbands.",
            "At this age K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoyed ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101,exhibiting His power of joking with the cowherd girls and enjoying their company in the bushes of the gardens by the bank of the Yamun\u0101.",
            "In this connection there is the following statement: \u201cThroughout the whole tract of land known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there were the footprints of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thegop\u012bs,and in some places peacock feathers were strewn about. In some places there were nice beddings in the bushes of the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana gardens, and in some places there were piles of dust due to the group-dancing of Govinda and thegop\u012bs.\u201d These are some of the features which are due to the different pastimes invented by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the place known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "There is the following statement by onegop\u012b,describing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attractive feature during this age: \u201cMy dear friend, just see how all of a sudden in the sky of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is a powerful rising sun and how this rising sun is minimizing the rays of our chastity moon. Our attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so intense that it is drying up the lotus flower of our discrimination, and we are losing our senses in deciding whether we shall continue as chaste women or be victimized by the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. My dear friend, I think that we have lost all hope of life!\u201d",
            "In thekai\u015boraage, beginning from the eleventh year and continuing up to the end of the fifteenth year, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arms, legs and thighs became marked with three divisional lines. At that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s chest challenged a hill ofmarakatajewels, His arms challenged pillars of theindran\u012blajewel, the three lines of His waist challenged the waves of the river Yamun\u0101, and His thighs challenged beautiful bananas. Onegop\u012bsaid, \u201cWith all these exquisite features of His body, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is too extraordinarily beautiful, and therefore I am always thinking of Him to protect me, because He is the killer of all demons.\u201d",
            "The idea expressed in this statement is that thegop\u012bswere comparing their attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to an attack by demons; and to counteract their attraction for the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they were also turning to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a hopefully, because He is the killer of all kinds of demons. In other words, they were perplexed, because on one hand they were attracted by the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and on the other they needed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to drive away the demon of such attraction.",
            "Thiskai\u015boraage can be translated as adolescence. At the end of this period all thegop\u012bssaid, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the killer of the attraction of Cupid, and as such He disturbs the patience of all newly married girls. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s bodily features have become so exquisite\u00a0\u2013 it is as if they were all manifesting an artistic sense of the highest sort. His dancing eyes have dimmed the brilliance of the most expert dancer, and so there is no longer any comparison to the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Learned scholars therefore describe the features of His body at this time asnava-yauvana,newly invented youthfulness. At this stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s bodily features, the conjugal love affairs with thegop\u012bsand similar pastimes become very prominent.",
            "There are six features of conjugal love affairs called peacemaking, picking a quarrel, going to meet one\u2019s lover, sitting together, separation and support. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expanded an empire of these six features, of which He was the ruling prince. Somewhere He was picking quarrels with the young girls, somewhere He was scratching them with the nails of parrots, somewhere He was busy going to visit thegop\u012bs,and somewhere He was negotiating through cowherd friends to take shelter of thegop\u012bs.",
            "Some of thegop\u012bsaddressed Him thus: \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because of Your adolescent age, You have just become the spiritual master of these young girls, and You are teaching them to whisper among themselves. You are teaching them to offer solemn prayers, as well as training them to cheat their husbands and to join You in the gardens at night without caring for the instructions of their superiors. You are enthusing them by the vibration of Your enchanting flute; and, as their teacher, You are teaching them all the intricacies of loving affairs.\u201d",
            "It is said that even when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a boy of five He manifested such youthful energies, but learned scholars do not explain them because of the absence of suitable age. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was beautiful because every part of His body was perfectly arranged without any defect. Such perfect bodily features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are described as follows: \u201cMy dear enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, Your broad eyes, Your rising chest, Your two pillarlike arms and the thin middle portion of Your body are always enchanting to every lotus-eyed beautiful girl.\u201d The ornaments on the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were not actually enhancing His beauty, but just the reverse\u00a0\u2013 the ornaments were beautified by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "A person is called mild when he cannot even bear the touch of the most soft thing. It is described that every part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body was so soft that even at the touch of newly grown leaves, the color of the touched part of His skin would change. At thiskai\u015boraage, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s endeavors were always bent toward arranging ther\u0101sadance as well as toward killing the demons in the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was engaged in enjoyment with the boys and girls within the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Ka\u1e41sa used to send his associates to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would show His prowess by killing them.",
            "K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A\u2019S APPAREL AND GARLANDS",
            "Generally, there are four kinds of garments on the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: His shirt, turban, belt and wearing garments. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He used to put on reddish garments, with a golden shirt on His body and an orange-colored turban on His head. The different kinds of belts, combined with His enchanting smile, used to always increase the transcendental bliss of His associates. This dress of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as gorgeous. As a baby elephant is sometimes dressed in colorful clothing, so K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s gorgeousness was manifested by decoration with such colorful clothing on the different parts of His body.",
            "\u0100kalparefers to the texture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hair, His nicely dressed body anointed with sandalwood pulp and decorated with flower garlands, Histilakaand His chewing pan. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was decorated constantly in this\u0101kalpaprocess. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hair was sometimes decorated with flowers placed on the middle of His head, or else it was reaching down to His back. In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dressed His hair differently at different times. As for the ointment on His body, the pulp of sandalwood generally appeared to be white, and when it was mixed with saffron dye it appeared to be yellow.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used to put avaijayant\u012bgarland around His neck. Thisvaijayant\u012bgarland is made of flowers of at least five different colors. Such a garland was always long enough to touch K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s knees or feet. Besides this garland of flowers, there were other kinds of flower garlands too\u00a0\u2013 sometimes decorating His head, sometimes hanging around His neck and chest. Artistic paintings with sandalwood pulp and colored sandalwood were also to be found on the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Onegop\u012baddressed her friend and began to praise the bodily features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. She praised His blackish complexion, the reddish color of chewing pan enhancing His beauty hundreds of times, the curling hair on His head, theku\u1e45kuma* red spots on His body and thetilakaon His forehead.",
            "*Ku\u1e45kumais a sweetly flavored reddish powder that is thrown on the bodies of worshipable persons.",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the enemy of Agha, always looked beautiful with His incomparable helmet, His earrings made of diamonds, His necklace of pearls, His bangles, His embroidered garments and the beautiful rings on His fingers.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes calledvana-m\u0101l\u012b.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was dressed like this not only in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana but also on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Seeing such colorful dress and the garlands of different flowers, some great sages prayed, \u201cLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going to the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra not to fight, but to grace all of the devotees with His presence.\u201d",

            "As far as His flute is concerned, it is said that the vibration of this wonderful instrument was able to break the meditation of the greatest sages. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was thus challenging Cupid by advertising His transcendental glories all over the world.",
            "There are three kinds of flutes used by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One is calledve\u1e47u,one is calledmural\u012b,and the third is calledva\u1e41\u015b\u012b.

This kind of flute produces a very enchanting sound. Theva\u1e41\u015b\u012bflute is about fifteen inches long, with nine holes on its body. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used to play on these three flutes occasionally when they were needed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a longerva\u1e41\u015b\u012b,which is calledmah\u0101nand\u0101,orsammohin\u012b.When it is still longer it is called\u0101kar\u1e63i\u1e47\u012b.When it is even longer it is called\u0101nandin\u012b.The\u0101nandin\u012bflute is very pleasing to the cowherd boys and is technically namedva\u1e41\u015bul\u012b.These flutes were sometimes bedecked with jewels. Sometimes they were made of marble and sometimes of hollow bamboo. When the flute is made of jewels it is calledsammohin\u012b.When made of gold, it is called\u0101kar\u1e63i\u1e47\u012b.",

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used a buffalo horn as a bugling instrument. This instrument was always highly polished and circled with gold bands, and on the middle there was a hole. Regarding these instruments, there is a metaphorical statement about agop\u012bnamed T\u0101r\u0101val\u012b. It is said that T\u0101r\u0101val\u012b was bitten by the most venomous snake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute. Then, in order to neutralize the poisonous effect, she drank the milk produced by the buffalo horn in the hand of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But instead of decreasing the poisonous effect, it increased it a thousand times. Thegop\u012bwas thus put into the most miserable poisoned condition.",

This P\u0101\u00f1cajanya conch is also mentioned in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sounded it before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. It is said that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blows on His transcendental conch shell, the wives of the demons become subject to abortions and the wives of the demigods become blessed with all auspiciousness.

This Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b day is the most opulent festival day for the devotees, and it is still observed with great pomp in every Hindu house in India.

            "CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN",
            "Symptoms of Ecstatic Love",
            "The bodily symptoms manifested by a devotee in expressing ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are calledanubh\u0101va.Practical examples ofanubh\u0101vaare as follows: dancing, rolling on the ground, singing very loudly, stretching the body, crying loudly, yawning, breathing very heavily, neglecting the presence of others, drooling, laughing like a madman, wheeling the head and belching. When there is an extraordinary excess of ecstatic love, with all of these bodily symptoms manifested, one feels relieved transcendentally.",
            "These symptoms are divided into two parts: one is called\u015b\u012bta,and the other is calledk\u1e63epa\u1e47a.When there is yawning, the symptoms are called\u015b\u012bta,and when there is dancing they are calledk\u1e63epa\u1e47a.",
            "DANCING",
            "While watching ther\u0101sadance performed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thegop\u012bs,Lord \u015aiva beheld the beautiful face of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and immediately began to dance and beat upon his smalldi\u1e47\u1e0dimadrum. While Lord \u015aiva was dancing in ecstasy, his eldest son, Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, joined him.",
            "ROLLING ON THE GROUND",
            "In the Third Canto, first chapter, verse 32 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Vidura inquires from Uddhava, \u201cMy dear friend, is Akr\u016bra in an auspicious condition? Not only is he a learned scholar and sinless, but he is also a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He has such ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that I have seen him rolling upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s footprints in the dust as if bereft of all sense.\u201d Similarly, onegop\u012bgave a message to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, because of Her separation from Him and because of Her enchantment with the aroma of His flower garlands, was rolling on the ground, thereby bruising Her soft body.",
            "SINGING LOUDLY",
            "Onegop\u012binformed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that when \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was singing about His glories, She enchanted all of Her friends in such a way that they became stonelike and dull. At the same time, the nearby stones began to melt away in ecstatic love.",
            "When N\u0101rada Muni was chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra,he chanted so loudly that it was apprehended that Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha had appeared. Thus all the demons began to flee in different directions.",
            "STRETCHING THE BODY",
            "It is said that sometimes when N\u0101rada, the carrier of thev\u012b\u1e47\u0101,remembers his Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in great ecstasy, he begins to stretch his body so vigorously that his sacred thread gives way.",
            "CRYING LOUDLY",
            "Agop\u012bonce said to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by the sound of Your flute \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b has become full of lamentation and fear, and thus, with a faltering voice, She is crying like akurar\u012bbird.\u201d",
            "It is described that by hearing the vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, Lord \u015aiva becomes very puzzled and begins to cry so loudly into space that the demons become vanquished and the devotees become overwhelmed with joy.",
            "YAWNING",
            "It is said that when the full moon rises, the lotus petals become expanded. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used to appear before R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Her face, which is compared to the lotus flower, would expand by Her yawning.",
            "BREATHING HEAVILY",
            "As far as breathing heavily is concerned, it is stated, \u201cLalit\u0101 [one of thegop\u012bs] is just like ac\u0101tak\u012bbird, which only takes water falling directly from the rain cloud and not from any other source.\u201d In this statement K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is compared to the dark cloud, and Lalit\u0101 is compared to thec\u0101tak\u012bbird seeking only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s company. The metaphor continues to say, \u201cAs a heavy wind sometimes disperses a mighty cloud, so the heavy breath from Lalit\u0101\u2019s nostrils caused her to miss K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who had disappeared by the time she recovered herself.\u201d",
            "NEGLECTING THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS",
            "As far as neglecting the presence of others is concerned, the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho were performing sacrifices at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana left home as soon as they heard that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was nearby. They left their homes without caring for their learned husbands. The husbands began to discuss this among themselves: \u201cHow wonderful is the attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that it has made these women leave us without any care!\u201d This is the influence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who becomes attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be relieved from the bondage of birth and death, which can be compared to the locked-up homes that were neglected by the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as.",
            "In thePady\u0101val\u012bthere is a statement by some devotees: \u201cWe shall not care for any outsiders. If they should deride us, we shall still not care for them. We shall simply enjoy the transcendental mellow of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus we shall roll on the ground and dance ecstatically. In this way we shall eternally enjoy transcendental bliss.\u201d",
            "DROOLING",
            "As an example of the running down of saliva from the mouth, it is stated that sometimes when N\u0101rada Muni was chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra,he remained stunned for a while, and saliva oozed from his mouth.",
            "LAUGHING LIKE A MADMAN",
            "When a devotee laughs very loudly like a madman, it is done out of an extraordinary agitation of ecstatic love within the heart. Such mad laughing is an expression of the condition of the heart that is technically calleda\u1e6d\u1e6da-h\u0101sa.When a devotee becomes affected with this mental condition, his love is expressed through the lips. The laughing sounds, coming one after another, are compared to flowers falling from the creeper of devotion that grows within the heart of the devotee. In theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5btadevotional service to the Lord is also compared to a creeper that rises up to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "WHEELING OF THE HEAD",
            "Onegop\u012btold her friend, \u201cIt appears that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the enemy of the demon Agha, has released from His mouth a whirlwind which is acting on your head and is gradually proceeding to do the same to the other lotus-eyedgop\u012bs.\u201d",
            "BELCHING",
            "Sometimes belching also becomes a symptom of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There is evidence of this in Paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b\u2019s address to one crying associate of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b: \u201cMy dear daughter, don\u2019t be worried because \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is belching. I am about to offer a remedial measure for this symptom. Do not cry so loudly. This belching is not due to indigestion; it is a sign of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. I shall arrange to cure this belching symptom immediately. Don\u2019t be worried.\u201d This statement by Paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b is evidence that ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes manifested through belching.",
            "Sometimes trembling of the whole body and hemorrhaging from some part of the body are also manifested in response to ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such symptoms are very rare, and therefore \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b does not discuss any further on this point."

            "CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT",
            "Existential Ecstatic Love",
            "When a devotee is always intensely affected by love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a direct relationship with Him\u00a0\u2013 or even a little apart from Him\u00a0\u2013 his status is called existential ecstatic love. The symptoms originating from such existential ecstatic love are divided into three headings\u00a0\u2013 namely, moist, burnt and dried-up.",
            "Moist existential ecstatic love aroused in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is divided into two: direct and indirect. R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was weaving a garland ofkundaflowers, and upon hearing the vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, She immediately stopped Her work. This is an example of direct moistened existential ecstatic love. Indirect moistened existential ecstatic love is described in the following statement: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is also called Puru\u1e63ottama, is to the eyes of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 just like the cloud is to the eyes of thec\u0101tak\u012bbird. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been brought to Mathur\u0101, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, being very anxious and angry, began to rebuke the king of Mathur\u0101.",
            "Burnt existential ecstatic love is divided into three, and one example is as follows: One day, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was dreaming that the gigantic demon P\u016btan\u0101 was lying on the courtyard of her house, and she immediately became anxious to seek out K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When there are manifestations of ecstatic symptoms in the body of a nondevotee, these are called dried-up symptoms of ecstatic love. The nondevotees are actually materialistic, but in contact with some pure devotee, they may sometimes manifest some symptoms of ecstasy. Devotional scholars call these dried-up symptoms.",
            "There are eight symptoms of existential ecstatic love: becoming stunned, perspiring, standing of the hairs on the body, faltering of the voice, trembling of the body, changing of bodily colors, shedding of tears and devastation.",
            "The scientific explanation of these eight symptoms is given by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as follows. When the vital force of life is in contact with the earth, one is stunned. When the same force comes into contact with water, there is the shedding of tears. When the same force comes into contact with fire, there is perspiration. When the force comes into contact with the sky, there is complete devastation. And when that force comes into contact with the air, there is trembling, failing of the voice and standing of the hairs on the body.",
            "These symptoms are sometimes manifested internally and sometimes externally. The pure devotee always feels such symptomatic expressions within himself, but being afraid of outsiders he does not generally manifest them externally.",
            "BECOMING STUNNED",
            "The symptom of being stunned is caused by ecstatic tribulation, fearfulness, astonishment, lamentation and anger. This symptom is exhibited by a stoppage of talking, a stoppage of movement, a feeling of voidness and an extreme feeling of separation.",
            "When Uddhava was describing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes to Vidura, he said, \u201cOne day thegop\u012bsbecame stunned when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the dress of a gardening maid, entered the greenhouse and enlivened them with joking and laughter. Then when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left the greenhouse, thegop\u012bswere seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so ecstatically that it was as though both their minds and eyes were following Him.\u201d These symptoms signify that although thegop\u012bs\u2019 business was not finished, they had become stunned with ecstatic love.",
            "Another example of being stunned took place when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was surrounded by various wrestlers in the sacrificial arena of Ka\u1e41sa. His mother, Devak\u012b,* then became stunned, and her eyes dried up when she saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a among the wrestlers.",
            "*\u00a0Devak\u012b was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d mother. To protect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Ka\u1e41sa, Vasudeva brought Him to Ya\u015bod\u0101 in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where He exhibited His childhood pastimes. Later He returned to Mathur\u0101 and vanquished Ka\u1e41sa, the incident referred to here.",
            "There is also an example of the astonishment of Lord Brahm\u0101. It is explained in the Tenth Canto, thirteenth chapter, verse 56 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthat when Brahm\u0101 understood that this cowherd boy was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, he became stunned. All of his sensory activities stopped when he saw all the cowherd boys again, along with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Brahm\u0101 was so stunned that he appeared to be a golden statue with four heads. Also, when the residents of Vraja found that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had lifted Govardhana Hill with His left hand, they became stunned.",
            "Astonishment caused by lamentation was exemplified when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was entering into the belly of the Bak\u0101sura demon and all the demigods from higher planets became stunned with lamentation. A similar example of becoming stunned was visible in Arjuna when he saw that A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was attempting to release hisbrahm\u0101stra* at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "*\u00a0Thebrahm\u0101strawas a nuclear weapon controlled bymantra,or sound vibration.",
            "PERSPIRING",
            "An example of perspiring because of jubilation is described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Onegop\u012baddressed R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, You are rebuking the sunshine unnecessarily, but I can understand that You are perspiring only because of Your becoming too lusty at seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "Perspiration caused by fearfulness was exhibited by Raktaka, one of the servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One day K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dressed Himself just like Abhimanyu, the husband of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Abhimanyu did not like R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore when Raktaka saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the dress of Abhimanyu and thus mistook His identity, he began to strongly rebuke Him. As soon as Raktaka finally understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the dress of Abhimanyu, he began perspiring. This perspiration was caused by fearfulness.",
            "Perspiration due to anger was exhibited by Garu\u1e0da, the eagle who is the carrier of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Once the heavenly king, Indra, was sending torrents of rain over V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Garu\u1e0da was observing the incident from above the clouds, and because of his anger, he began perspiring.",
            "STANDING OF THE HAIRS ON THE BODY",
            "The standing up of hair on the body was manifested when mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 found within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mouth all of the universal planetary systems. She had asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to open His mouth wide just to see whether He had eaten dirt. But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a opened His mouth, she saw not only the entire earth but also many other planets within His mouth. This caused a standing up of the hair on her body.",
            "The standing up of hair on the body resulting from jubilation is described in the Tenth Canto, thirtieth chapter, verse 10 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamin connection with thegop\u012bsengaged in ther\u0101sadance. During thisr\u0101sadance K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a disappeared all of a sudden with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, and thegop\u012bsbegan to search Him out. At that time they addressed the earth and said, \u201cDear earthly planet, how many austerities and penances you must have undergone to have the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always touching your surface. I think that you must be very jubilant, because the trees and plants, which are just like hairs on your body, are standing up so gloriously. May we ask when you first got these symptoms? Have you been enjoying this jubilation since you were touched by the incarnation V\u0101mana or since you were delivered by the incarnation Var\u0101ha?\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would sometimes perform mock fighting along with the cowherd boys. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blew His horn in this mock fighting, \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, who was on the opposing side, felt his bodily hairs stand up. Similarly, when Arjuna saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His gigantic universal form, there was a standing of the hairs on his body.",
            "FALTERING OF THE VOICE",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going to Mathur\u0101 on the chariot driven by Akr\u016bra, Ya\u015bod\u0101 and all thegop\u012bscame to try to forbid Him to pass and to block His way. At that time R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was so perturbed that in a faltering voice She requested mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 to please stop Akr\u016bra.",
            "Faltering of the voice resulting from wonder was exhibited by Brahm\u0101. It is said in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, thirteenth chapter, verse 64 that after bowing down before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when Brahm\u0101 began to rise he prayed to the Lord in a faltering voice.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twenty-ninth chapter, verse 30, another example of faltering of the voice was exhibited by thegop\u012bswhen they came to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, desiring to dance with Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asked them to go back to their husbands and homes. Thegop\u012bsapparently became very angry and began to talk to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with faltering voices.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, thirty-ninth chapter, verses 56 and 57 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,a faltering voice due to jubilation was exhibited by Akr\u016bra when he was shown all of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets resting within the river Yamun\u0101. When Akr\u016bra understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he bowed his head to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet and with folded hands began to pray in a faltering voice.",
            "There are also examples of faltering of the voice caused by fearfulness. One of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends praised Him thus: \u201cMy dear friend, Your flute was given to Your servant Patr\u012b, and when I asked him to return it he began speaking in a faltering voice and his complexion became yellow.\u201d",
            "TREMBLING",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was trying to capture the demon \u015aa\u1e45kha, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b began trembling out of fearfulness. Similar trembling of the body was exhibited in Sahadeva, the younger brother of Nakula. When \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was vehemently blaspheming the Lord, Sahadeva began to tremble out of anger.",
            "Trembling of the body was also exhibited by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b out of tribulation. R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b trembled as She told one of thegop\u012bs,\u201cDon\u2019t joke with this disappointing boy! Please ask Him not to approach Me, because He is always the cause of all grief for us.\u201d",
            "CHANGING OF BODILY COLOR",
            "Sometimes, due to great aggrievement caused by the dealings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the body changes color. Thegop\u012bstherefore addressed the Lord thus: \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, due to separation from You, all of the denizens of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana have changed their color. And because of this change of color even the great sage N\u0101rada was thinking of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as a white island in the ocean of milk.\u201d",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma were present in the arena of Ka\u1e41sa, Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s body changed color. Similarly, Indra\u2019s face changed color when he saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was protecting all the denizens of Vraja by lifting Govardhana Hill. If the color change takes place due to excessive jubilation, the hue turns red. Because such a change of color is so rare, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b does not further discuss this point.",
            "TEARS",
            "Out of jubilation, anger or separation there may be the pouring down of tears from the eyes. When such tears are very cold they are due to jubilation, and when they are due to anger the tears become hot. In all cases there is a severe movement of the eyes, and the eyes generally become reddish. There is also an itching sensation that causes the sufferer to rub his eyes.",
            "When the lotus-eyed Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, the first queen of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, was shedding tears out of ecstatic jubilation, she did not like the tears. There is a passage in theHari-va\u1e41\u015bawherein Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 begins to shed tears because of her great affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "An example of shedding tears because of anger was exhibited by Bh\u012bma when he saw that \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was insulting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the R\u0101jas\u016bya arena of sacrifice. Bh\u012bma wanted to kill \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la immediately, but because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not order him to do so, he became morose with anger. It is described that there were hot tears covering his eyes, as a thin cloud sometimes covers the evening moon. In the evening, when the moon is slightly covered by a thin cloud, it looks very nice, and when Bh\u012bma was shedding tears on account of his anger, he also looked very nice.",
            "In the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,sixtieth chapter, verse 23, there is a nice example of Rukmi\u1e47\u012b\u2019s shedding tears of lamentation. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Rukmi\u1e47\u012b were talking, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b became frightened of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore she began scratching the earth with her red, lotuslike nails. Because she was shedding tears, the black ointment from her eyes was dripping, along with the tears, onto her breasts, which were covered withku\u1e45kumapowder. Rukmi\u1e47\u012b was so aggrieved that her voice was choked up.",
            "DEVASTATION",
            "When a person is confused by simultaneous happiness and tribulation and does not know what to do, this state of confusion is calledpralaya,or devastation. In this condition ofpralayaone sometimes falls down on the ground, and all the symptoms of ecstatic love become manifest. When thegop\u012bswere searching after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and all of a sudden He came out from the bushes and creepers, all of them became stunned and almost senseless. In this state thegop\u012bsappeared very beautiful. This is an example ofpralaya,or devastation, in happiness.",
            "There are also instances ofpralayain distress. One such example is described in the Tenth Canto, thirty-ninth chapter, verse 15 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,wherein \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, when thegop\u012bswere missing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they were so much absorbed in meditation upon Him that all of their senses stopped functioning and they lost all bodily sense. It was as though they had become liberated from all material conditions.\u201d",
            "DEGREES OF ECSTATIC SYMPTOMS",
            "Out of the many ecstatic symptoms of the body, the symptom of being stunned is especially significant. According to the degree of being stunned, the vital force within the body becomes agitated, and due to such a state, the other ecstatic loving symptoms sometimes become altered. These transcendental ecstatic symptoms gradually develop, and in the course of such development they are sometimes called smoky, sometimes called blazing, and sometimes called shining. These three degrees are experienced for many, many years, and they extend to different parts of the body. Unlike the shedding of tears and faltering of the voice, the condition of being stunned is spread all over the body. The shedding of tears and faltering of the voice are simply localized symptoms.",
            "The shedding of tears, however, sometimes makes the eyes become swollen and whitish, and sometimes the lenses of the eyes become differently focused. Faltering of the voice may sometimes cause choking in the throat and extreme anxiety. As the different symptoms of these ecstatic manifestations are localized, they are accompanied by different local reactions; e.g., when the throat is choked up because of a faltering voice, there may be a sound like\u201cghura.\u201dSuch sounds choke the voice, and with extreme mental anxiety they may be manifest in different ways. All these symptoms are listed under the dried-up existential condition known as smoky, and they are exhibited in different ways.",
            "Sometimes, while participating in ceremonies celebrating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes, or in the society of devotees, there is dancing ecstasy. Such sentiments are called blazing.",
            "None of the above symptoms can be manifested without the basic principle of strong attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the smoky condition of such ecstatic expressions, the symptoms could otherwise be hidden. This type of symptom was experienced by the priest Garga Muni, who was performing some ritualistic ceremony in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. When he heard about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s killing of the Agh\u0101sura demon, there were some tears visible in his eyes, his throat was trembling, and perspiration covered his whole body. In this way priest Garga Muni\u2019s beautiful face assumed a nice condition.",
            "When several such ecstatic symptoms are visible, the condition is called blazing. For example, one of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends told Him, \u201cMy dear friend, as soon as I heard the sound of Your flute from within the forest, my hands became almost motionless and my eyes became full of tears\u00a0\u2013 so much so, in fact, that I could not recognize Your peacock feather. My thighs became almost completely stunned so that I could not move even an inch. Therefore, my dear friend, I must acknowledge the wonderful vibration of Your transcendental flute.\u201d",
            "Similarly, onegop\u012bsaid to another, \u201cMy dear friend, when I heard the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, I tried to hide myself from the reaction of the vibrations. But still I could not check the trembling of my body, and therefore all of my friends in the house could detect my attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without any doubt.\u201d",
            "When the ecstatic symptoms cannot be checked and they simultaneously appear in four or five different categories, this stage of ecstatic love is called shining. The example is cited, in this connection, that when the sage N\u0101rada saw Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a standing before him, his body became so stunned that he stopped playing on hisv\u012b\u1e47\u0101.Because of his faltering voice, he could not offer any prayers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his eyes filled with tears. Thus, N\u0101rada\u2019s ability to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was also obstructed.",
            "When similar symptoms were manifest in the body of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, some of Her friends criticized Her: \u201cDear friend, You are blaming the aroma of the flowers for the tears in Your eyes. You are rebuking the air for the standing of the hairs on Your body. And You are cursing Your walking in the forest for Your thighs\u2019 being stunned. But Your faltering voice reveals the cause to be different: it is just Your attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b remarks that when various symptoms become manifest very prominently, the devotee\u2019s condition may be called the brightest. For example, a friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a addressed Him as follows: \u201cMy dear P\u012bt\u0101mbara, because of separation from You all the residents of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are perspiring. They are lamenting with different words, and their eyes have become moistened with tears. Actually, all of them are in great confusion.\u201d",
            "There is a supreme symptom of ecstatic love which is calledmah\u0101-bh\u0101va.Thismah\u0101-bh\u0101vaexpression was possible only in R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, but later on when \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya appeared to feel the mode of love of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, He also expressed all of the symptoms ofmah\u0101-bh\u0101va.\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in this connection that when the symptoms of ecstatic love become the most bright, that stage is accepted asmah\u0101-bh\u0101va.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b further analyzes the ecstatic loving expression into four divisions which are calleds\u0101ttvik\u0101bh\u0101sa.",
            "Sometimes impersonalists, who are not actually in devotional service, may also exhibit such symptoms of ecstatic love, but this is not accepted as actual ecstasy. It is a reflection only. For example, sometimes in V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b, a holy city for impersonalist scholars, there may be seen asanny\u0101s\u012bcrying from hearing the glories of the Lord. Impersonalists also sometimes chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantraand dance, but their aim is not to serve the Lord. It is to become one with the Lord and merge into His existence. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore says that even if the reactions to chanting are manifested in the impersonalist\u2019s body, they should not be considered to be symptoms of actual attachment, but reflections only, just like the sun reflected in a dark room through some polished glass. The chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is so nice and transcendental that it will eventually melt even the hearts of persons who are impersonalists. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the impersonalists\u2019 symptoms are simply reflections of ecstatic love, not the real thing.",
            "Sometimes it is found that when staunch logicians, without any trace of devotional service and without actually understanding the transcendental glories of the Lord, sit down to hear the glories of the Lord, they appear to be melting and shedding tears. In this connection there is a statement by a devotee who addresses the Lord thus: \u201cMy dear Mukunda, I cannot properly express the glories of Your pastimes. Even when the nondevotees hear of Your glorious pastimes they become affected and shed tears and start to tremble.\u201d Such nondevotees are not actually melted; they are hardhearted. But the influence of the glories of the Lord is so great that even the nondevotees sometimes shed tears.",
            "Sometimes it is found that a nondevotee who has practically no taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who follows no rules or regulations can, by practice, make a show of devotional symptoms, even crying in an assembly of devotees. This shedding of tears is not actually an ecstatic loving expression, however. It is done simply by practice. Although there is no need to describe these reflections of ecstatic love, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives some instances where there is no actual devotional service and such expressions are manifested."

            "CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE",
            "Expressions of Love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a",
            "There are some bodily symptoms that express overwhelming ecstatic love (vyabhic\u0101ri-bh\u0101va). They are counted at thirty-three as follows: disappointment, lamentation, humility, guilt, fatigue, intoxication, pride, doubt, apprehension, intense emotion, madness, forgetfulness, disease, confusion, death, laziness, inertness, bashfulness, concealment, remembrance, argumentativeness, anxiety, thoughtfulness, endurance, happiness, eagerness, violence, haughtiness, envy, impudence, dizziness, sleepiness and alertness.",
            "DISAPPOINTMENT",
            "When one is forced to act in a way that is forbidden, or to refrain from acting in a way that is proper, he becomes regretful and thinks himself dishonored. At that time there is a sense of disappointment. In this kind of disappointment one becomes full of anxiety, sheds tears, changes bodily color, feels humility and breathes heavily.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in punishing the K\u0101liya serpent, appeared to have drowned Himself in the poisonous water of the Yamun\u0101, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja addressed Ya\u015bod\u0101-dev\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear wife, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has gone deep into the water, and so there is no longer any need to maintain our bodies, which are so full of sinful activities! Let us also enter into the poisonous water of the Yamun\u0101 and compensate for the sinful activities of our lives!\u201d This is an instance of severe shock, wherein the devotee becomes greatly disappointed.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Subala, His intimate friend, decided to leave also. While leaving, Subala was contemplating that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there was no longer any pleasure to be found in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The analogy is given that as the bees go away from a flower that has no honey, Subala left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana when he found that there was no longer any relishable transcendental pleasure there.",
            "InD\u0101na-keli-kaumud\u012b\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b addresses one of Her friends in this manner: \u201cMy dear friend, if I cannot hear of the glorious activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is better for Me to become deaf. And because I am now unable to see Him, it would be good for Me to be a blind woman.\u201d This is another instance of disappointment due to separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There is a statement in theHari-va\u1e41\u015bawherein Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, one of the queens of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, tells her husband, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since I heard N\u0101rada glorifying Rukmi\u1e47\u012b before You, I can understand that there is no need of any talking about myself!\u201d This is an instance of disappointment caused by envy. Rukmi\u1e47\u012b and Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 were co-wives, and because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was husband of both, there naturally was some feminine envy between them. So when Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 heard the glories of Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, she was envious of her and thus became disappointed.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fifty-first chapter, verse 47 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is this statement: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I cannot say that it is only other people who are implicated in material existence because I too am much entangled with the bodily concept of life. I am always too anxious about my family, home, wife, wealth, land and kingdom. And because I have been so maddened by this material atmosphere, I am thinking now that my life has simply been spoiled.\u201d This statement is an instance of disappointment caused by lamentation.",
            "According to Bharata Muni, this disappointment is inauspicious. But there are other learned scholars who have accepted such disappointment as being in the mood of neutrality and as being a preservative of ecstatic love.",
            "LAMENTATION",
            "When one is unsuccessful in achieving his desired goal of life, when one finds no fulfillment in his present occupation, when one finds himself in reversed conditions and when one feels guilt\u00a0\u2013 at such a time one is said to be in a state of lamentation.",
            "In this condition of lamentation one becomes questioning, thoughtful, tearful, regretful and heavy-breathed. His bodily color changes and his mouth becomes dry.",
            "One aged devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a addressed Him in this way: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O killer of the demon Agha, my body is now invalid due to old age. I cannot speak very fluently, my voice is faltering, my mind is not strong, and I am often attacked by forgetfulness. But, my dear Lord, You are just like the moonlight, and my only real regret is that for want of any taste for Your pleasant shining I did not advance myself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d This statement is an instance of lamentation due to one\u2019s being unable to achieve his desired goal.",
            "One devotee said, \u201cThis night I was dreaming of collecting various flowers from the garden, and I was thinking of making a garland to offer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But I am so unfortunate that all of a sudden my dream was over, and I could not achieve my desired goal!\u201d This statement is an instance of lamentation resulting from nonfulfillment of one\u2019s duties.",
            "When Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw his foster son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a embarrassed in the sacrificial arena of Ka\u1e41sa, he said, \u201cHow unfortunate I am that I did not keep my son bolted within a room. Unfortunately, I have brought Him to Mathur\u0101, and now I see that He\u2019s embarrassed by this giant elephant named Kuvalaya. It is as though the moon of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were eclipsed by the shadow of the earth.\u201d This is an instance of lamentation caused by reversed conditions.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 9 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere is a statement by Brahm\u0101: \u201cMy dear Lord, just see my impudence! You are the unlimited, the original Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul\u00a0\u2013 and You rule over the most perfect illusory energies! And just see my impudence! I wanted to supersede You by my own personal power, and I was very puffed up with this tiny power of mine. Just as a simple spark from a fire cannot do any harm to the fire, so my bewildering potency was completely unsuccessful in thwarting Your superior illusory power. Therefore I find myself to be most insignificant and think of myself as a most useless person.\u201d This statement by Brahm\u0101 is an instance of lamentation caused by committing an offense.",
            "HUMILITY",
            "A sense of weakness caused by distress, fear or offensiveness is called humility. In such a humble condition one becomes talkative, small in heart, dirty in mind, full of anxiety and inactive.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fifty-first chapter, verse 57 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is the following statement by King Mucukunda: \u201cMy dear Lord, because of my bad deeds in the past I am everlastingly aggrieved. I am always suffering from my desires, but still my senses are never satisfied with material enjoyments. Somehow or other, by Your grace, I am now in a peaceful condition because I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, which are always free from all lamentation, fear and death. O supreme protector, O supreme soul! O supreme controller! Kindly give me Your protection. I am so much embarrassed.\u201d This statement by Mucukunda is an instance of humility resulting from a severely miserable condition of material existence.",
            "When Uttar\u0101 was attacked by thebrahm\u0101straof A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, she became afraid of losing her child, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who was still within the womb. She immediately surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and said, \u201cMy dear Lord, kindly save my child! I do not mind if I myself must be killed by thebrahm\u0101straof A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101.\u201d This is an instance of humility caused by fear.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 10 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Lord Brahm\u0101 says, \u201cO infallible one! I am born in the mode of passion, and therefore I have been falsely proud of being the creator of this material world. My false pride was just like dense darkness, and in this darkness I had become blind. In my blindness I was considering myself a competitor to You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But, my dear Lord, even though I am accepted as the creator of this universe, I am eternally Your servant. Therefore, kindly always be compassionate toward me and excuse me in that way.\u201d This statement by Brahm\u0101 is another instance of humility resulting from committing an offense.",
            "Sometimes there is humility due to shyness. For example, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stole all of the garments from thegop\u012bswhile they were bathing in the river, all of them begged K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not to commit this injustice upon them. Thegop\u012bsaddressed Him thus: \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we know that You are the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and that You are the most beloved of all V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. And You are very much loved by us also! But why are You giving us this trouble? Kindly return our garments. Just see how we are trembling from the severe cold!\u201d This humility was due to their shyness from being naked before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "GUILT",
            "When a person blames himself for committing an inappropriate action, his feeling is called guilt.",
            "One day \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was churning yogurt for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At that time the jeweled bangles on Her hands were circling around and She was also chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All of a sudden She thought, \u201cI am chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and My superiors\u00a0\u2013 My mother-in-law and My sister-in-law\u00a0\u2013 may hear Me!\u201d By this thought R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became overanxious. This is an instance of feeling guilty because of devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One day the beautiful-eyed \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b entered into the forest to collect some flowers to prepare a garland for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. While collecting the flowers, She became afraid that someone might see Her, and She felt some fatigue and weakness. This is an instance of guilty feelings caused by labor for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There is a statement inRasa-sudh\u0101karathat after passing the night with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became so weak that She was unable to get up from bed. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took Her hand to help Her, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b felt guilty about having passed the night with Him.",
            "FATIGUE",
            "One feels fatigue after walking a long distance, after dancing and after sexual activity. In this kind of fatigue there is dizziness, perspiration, inactivity of the limbs, yawning and very heavy breathing.",
            "One day Ya\u015bod\u0101 was chasing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the yard after He had offended her. After a while, Ya\u015bod\u0101 became very fatigued, and therefore she was perspiring, and her bunched hair became loosened. This is an instance of becoming fatigued because of working too much.",
            "Sometimes all of the cowherd friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, along with Balar\u0101ma, danced together in some ceremony. At these times the garlands on their necks would move, and the boys would begin to perspire. Their whole bodies became wet from their ecstatic dancing. This is an instance of fatigue caused by dancing.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, thirty-third chapter, verse 20, it is said that after enjoying love affairs with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by dancing, embracing and kissing, thegop\u012bswould sometimes become very tired, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, out of His causeless mercy and compassion, would smear their faces with His lotus hands. This is an example of fatigue caused by laboring in ther\u0101sadance.",
            "INTOXICATION",
            "When one becomes arrogant with false prestige due to drinking intoxicants or being too lustful, the voice becomes faulty, the eyes become swollen, and there are symptoms of redness on the body. There is a statement in theLalita-m\u0101dhavathat Lord Baladeva, intoxicated from drinking excessive quantities of honey, once began to address the ants, \u201cO you kings of the ants! Why are you hiding yourselves in these holes?\u201d At the same time He also addressed the king of heaven, \u201cO King Indra! You plaything of \u015aac\u012b! Why are you laughing? I am now prepared to smash the whole universe, and I know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will not be angry with Me.\u201d* Then He addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, tell Me immediately why the whole world is trembling and why the moon has become elongated! And O you members of the Yadu dynasty, why are you laughing at Me? Please give Me back My liquors made of honey from thekadambaflower!\u201d \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b prays that Lord Balar\u0101ma will be pleased with all of us while He is thus talking just like an intoxicated person.",
            "*\u00a0Baladeva, or Balar\u0101ma, is the older brother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is an expansion of the Godhead Himself, and therefore to be considered an incarnation of God, as explained in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.",
            "In this state of intoxication, Balar\u0101ma felt tired and lay down for rest. Generally, those who are exalted personalities lie down when they feel intoxicated, whereas those who are mediocre laugh and sing during intoxication, and those who are lowly use vulgar language and sometimes cry. Such intoxication is manifested according to different ages and mentalities. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b does not describe further in this direction because there is no necessity for such a discussion.",
            "There is another description of the symptoms of intoxication in the person of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b after She saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes She was walking hither and thither, sometimes She was laughing, sometimes She was covering Her face, sometimes She was talking without any meaning, and sometimes She was praying to Her associategop\u012bs.Seeing these symptoms in R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, thegop\u012bsbegan to talk among themselves: \u201cJust see how R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b has become intoxicated simply by seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before Her!\u201d This is an instance of ecstatic love in intoxication.",
            "PRIDE",
            "Expressions of ecstatic love in pride may be the result of excessive wealth, exquisite beauty, a first-class residence or the attainment of one\u2019s ideal goal. One is also considered proud when he does not care about the neglect of others.",
            "Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are leaving me, forcibly getting out of my clutches. But I shall be impressed by Your strength only when You can go forcibly from the core of my heart.\u201d This is an instance of feeling pride in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Once during ther\u0101sadance, when R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b left the arena and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to seek Her out, one of the dear friends of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You have been very much obliging in serving the form of our \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, and now You have left all the othergop\u012bsto search for Her. Please allow me to inquire how You want Her to treat You.\u201d This is an instance of feeling pride on account of exquisite beauty.",
            "Sometimes R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b felt pride within Herself and said, \u201cAlthough the cowherd boys prepare nice flower garlands for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when I present My garland to Him, He becomes struck with wonder and immediately accepts it and puts it on His heart.\u201d",
            "Similarly, in the Tenth Canto, second chapter, verse 33 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Lord Brahm\u0101 says, \u201cMy dear Madhus\u016bdana, persons who are pure devotees of Your Lordship actually feel Your ecstatic friendship, and as such they are never vanquished by enemies. They know they are always protected by You, and so they can matter-of-factly pass over the heads of their enemies without any care.\u201d In other words, one who has taken complete shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord is always proud of being able to conquer all enemies.",
            "One weaver at Mathur\u0101 addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way: \u201cMy dear King of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, I have become so proud of Your causeless mercy upon me that I do not even count upon the mercy of the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, which is sought after by many great sages in deep meditation.\u201d In other words, although theyog\u012bsand great sages sit in meditation upon Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is residing in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so proud that he does not consider such meditation to be very valuable. This feeling of pride is due to one\u2019s having achieved the highest goal of life\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "DOUBT",
            "After Lord Brahm\u0101 had stolen all of the calves, cows and cowherd boys from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he was trying to go away. But all of a sudden he became doubtful about his stealing affairs and began to watch on all sides with his eight eyes. Lord Brahm\u0101 has four heads, and therefore he has eight eyes. This is an instance of ecstatic love in doubt, caused by stealing.",
            "Similarly, just to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Akr\u016bra stole the Syamantakama\u1e47i,a stone that can produce unlimited quantities of gold, but later on he repented his stealing. This is another instance of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in doubt caused by stealing.",
            "When the king of heaven, Indra, was causing torrents of rain to fall on the land of Vraja, he was advised to surrender himself at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At that time Indra\u2019s face became very dark because of doubt.",
            "APPREHENSION",
            "When a person becomes disturbed in his heart by seeing lightning in the sky, by seeing a ferocious animal or by hearing a tumultuous sound, his state of mind is called apprehensive. In such a state of apprehension, one tries to take shelter of something that provides safety. There may be standing of the hairs on the body, trembling of the body and sometimes the committing of mistakes. And sometimes the body may become stunned.",
            "In thePady\u0101val\u012bthere is the following statement: \u201cMy dear friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s residence in the demoniac circle at Mathur\u0101, under the supremacy of the king of demons, Ka\u1e41sa, is causing me much worry.\u201d This is one instance of apprehending some danger to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ecstatic love for Him.",
            "When V\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101sura appeared in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as a bull, all of thegop\u012bsbecame greatly affected with fear. Being perturbed in that way, they began to embrace thetam\u0101latrees. This is an instance of fear caused by a ferocious animal and of the search for shelter while remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ecstatic love. Upon hearing the jackals crying in the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 sometimes became very careful about keeping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under her vigilance, fearing that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might be attacked by them. This is an instance of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in fear caused by a tumultuous sound. This kind of fear is a little different from being actually afraid. When one is afraid of something, he can still think of past and future. But when there is this kind of ecstatic apprehension, there is no scope for such thinking.",
            "INTENSE EMOTION",
            "Emotion is caused by something very dear, by something very detestable, by fire, by strong wind, by strong rainfall, by some natural disturbance, by the sight of a big elephant or by the sight of an enemy. When there is emotion caused by seeing something very dear, one can speak very swiftly and use kind words. When there is emotion caused by seeing something detestable, one cries very loudly. When there is emotion caused by seeing fire, one tries to flee. There may also be trembling of the body, closing of the eyes and tears in the eyes. When one becomes emotional on account of a strong wind, one tries to run very swiftly and rubs his eyes. When one is emotional because of rainfall, one takes an umbrella, and there is tension in his body. When there is emotion due to a sudden disturbance, one\u2019s face becomes discolored, one becomes struck with wonder, and there is trembling of the body. If there is emotion from seeing an elephant, one may jump and show various signs of fear, and sometimes one may keep looking behind him. When there is emotion due to the presence of an enemy, one looks for a fatal weapon and tries to escape.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned from the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was so emotional from seeing her son that milk began to flow from her breasts. This is an instance of emotion caused by seeing a dear object.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twenty-third chapter, verse 18 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b informs King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, the wives of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere usually very much attached to the glorification of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they were always anxious to get an opportunity to see Him. Because of this, when they heard that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was nearby, they became very anxious to see Him and immediately left their homes.\u201d This is an instance of emotional activity caused by the presence of someone very dear.",
            "When P\u016btan\u0101, the demoniac witch, was struck down and killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was struck with wonder and began to cry emotionally, \u201cOh, what is this? What is this?\u201d When she saw that her dear baby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing on the chest of the dead demoniac woman, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, at a loss what to do, began to walk this way and that. This is an instance of being emotional on account of seeing something ghastly.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a uprooted the twoarjunatrees and Ya\u015bod\u0101 heard the sound of the trees crashing down, she became overcome with emotion and simply stared upward, being too bewildered to know what else to do. This is an instance of being emotional from hearing a tumultuous sound.",
            "When there was a forest fire in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, all the cowherd men assembled together and desperately appealed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for protection. This is an instance of emotion caused by fire.",
            "The whirlwind demon known as T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta once carried K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a off from the ground and blew Him around along with some very big trees. At that time, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 could not see her son, and she was so disturbed that she began to walk this way and that. This is an instance of emotion caused by severe wind.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twenty-fifth chapter, verse 11 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is a description of Indra\u2019s causing severe torrents of rain at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. All the cows and cowherd boys became so afflicted by the wind and cold that they all gathered together to take shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is an instance of emotion caused by severe rainfall.",
            "There were severe torrents of hail when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was staying in the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and the elderly persons bade Him, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, don\u2019t You move now! Even persons who are stronger and older than You cannot move, and You are just a little boy. So please stay still!\u201d This is an instance of emotion caused by heavy hailing.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was chastising K\u0101liya in the poisonous water of the Yamun\u0101, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 began to speak emotionally: \u201cOh, see how the earth appears to be trembling! There appears to be an earth tremor, and in the sky tears are flying here and there! My dear son has entered into the poisonous water of the Yamun\u0101. What shall I do now?\u201d This is an instance of emotion resulting from a natural disturbance.",
            "In the arena of Ka\u1e41sa, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was attacked by big elephants, all of the ladies present began to address Him in this way: \u201cMy dear boy\u00a0\u2013 please leave this place immediately! Please leave this place immediately! Don\u2019t You see the big elephants coming to attack You? Your innocent gazing upon them is causing us too much perturbation!\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a then told mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, \u201cMy dear mother, don\u2019t be perturbed by the appearance of the elephants and horses that are so forcibly coming and raising dust, causing blindness to these lotus-eyed women. Let even the Ke\u015b\u012b demon come before Me; My arms will still be adequate for victory. So please don\u2019t be perturbed.\u201d",

And yet the demon was killed by your little son. It appears to be due to the result of severe penances and austerities in your past lives that your son was saved in this way.\u201d",

At that time all of the princes present began to converse among themselves, saying, \u201cWe have our elephants, horses, chariots, bows, arrows and swords, so why should we be afraid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Let us attack Him! He is nothing but a lusty cowherd boy! He cannot take away the princess in this way! Let us all attack Him!\u201d This is an instance of emotion caused by the presence of enemies.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b is trying to prove by the above examples that in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is no question of impersonalism. All personal activities are there in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "MADNESS",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura prays in his book as follows: \u201cLet \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b purify the whole world, because She has surrendered Herself completely unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Out of Her ecstatic love for Him, She sometimes acted just like an addled person and attempted to churn yogurt, although there was no yogurt in the pot. And seeing this, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became so enchanted by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b that He began to milk a bull instead of a cow.\u201d These are some of the instances of insanity or madness in connection with the love affairs of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered the poisonous waters of the Yamun\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Ya\u015bod\u0101-dev\u012b went insane. Instead of searching for curative herbs, she began to speak to the trees as if they were snake chanters. With folded hands she began to bow down to the trees, asking them, \u201cWhat is the medicinal herb that can check K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dying from this poisonous water?\u201d This is an instance of insanity caused by some great danger.",
            "How a devotee can be in a state of insanity because of ecstatic love is described in the Tenth Canto, thirtieth chapter, verse 4 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,wherein thegop\u012bswere searching for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the forests of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Thegop\u012bswere loudly singing the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and wandering from one forest to another in search of Him. They knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not localized but all-pervading. He is in the sky, He is in the water, He is in the air, and He is the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart. Thus thegop\u012bsbegan to inquire from all kinds of trees and plants about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is an instance of ecstatic madness on the part of devotees.",
            "Similarly, there are symptoms of diseases caused by ecstatic love. This condition is credited by learned scholars as beingmah\u0101-bh\u0101va.This highly elevated condition is also calleddivyonm\u0101da,or transcendental madness.",
            "FORGETFULNESS",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and was staying in Mathur\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b sent news to Him that His mother, the queen of Vraja, was feeling such separation from Him that there was foam coming from her mouth, like the foam on the shore of the ocean. And sometimes she was raising her arms like the waves of the ocean, and because of her intense feelings of separation, she was rolling on the ground and creating a tumultuous roaring sound. And sometimes she was remaining completely silent, like a calm sea. These symptoms of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are calledapasm\u0101ra,or forgetfulness. One completely forgets his position when he manifests these symptoms in ecstatic love.",
            "Another message was once sent to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informing Him that after He had killed Ka\u1e41sa, one of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s demon friends had gone insane. This demon was foaming at the mouth, waving his arms and rolling on the ground. This demoniac demonstration is in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a ghastly humor. This mellow or flavor is one of the indirect relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The first five kinds of relationships are called direct, and the other seven are called indirect. Some way or other, the demon must have had some relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because these symptoms developed when he heard that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed Ka\u1e41sa. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b remarks that there is also transcendental excellence in this kind of symptom.",
            "DISEASE",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and was staying at Mathur\u0101, some of His friends informed Him, \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because of their separation from You, the inhabitants of Vraja are so afflicted that they appear to be diseased. Their bodies are feverish, and they cannot move properly. They are simply lying down on the ground and breathing heavily.\u201d",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twelfth chapter, verse 44 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it asked about Lord Ananta, and upon hearing this question, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b began to show symptoms of collapsing. Yet he checked himself and answered King Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s question in a mild voice. This collapsing condition is described as a feverish state resulting from ecstatic pleasure.",
            "There is another statement in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamtelling of the damsels of Vraja meeting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the sacred place of Kuruk\u1e63etra, many years after their childhood pastimes. When they met in that sacred place, all thegop\u012bsbecame stunned by the occurrence of a solar eclipse. Their breathing, blinking of the eyes and all similar activities stopped, and they stood before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just like statues. This is another instance of a diseased condition resulting from exuberant transcendental pleasure."

            "CONFUSION",
            "There is the following statement in theHa\u1e41sa-d\u016bta:\u201cOne day when \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was feeling much affliction because of Her separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, She went to the bank of the Yamun\u0101 with some of Her friends. There R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b saw a cottage wherein She and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had experienced many loving pleasures, and by remembering those incidents She immediately became overcome with dizziness. This dizziness was very prominently visible.\u201d This is an instance of confusion caused by separation.",
            "Similarly, there is a statement describing confusion caused by fearfulness. These symptoms were exhibited by Arjuna when he saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s universal form on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. His confusion was so strong that his bow and arrows fell from his hand and he could not perceive anything clearly.",
            "DEATH",
            "Once the Bak\u0101sura demon assumed the shape of a very big duck and opened his mouth in order to swallow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and all the cowherd boys. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was entering into the demon\u2019s mouth, Balar\u0101ma and the other cowherd boys almost fainted and appeared as though they had no life. Even if devotees are illusioned by some ghastly scene or by any accidental occurrence, they never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even in the greatest danger they can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the benefit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: even at the time of death, when all the functions of the body become dislocated, the devotee can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in his innermost consciousness, and this saves him from falling down into material existence. In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness immediately takes one from the material platform to the spiritual world.",
            "In this connection there is a statement about persons who died at Mathur\u0101: \u201cThese persons had a slight breathing exhilaration, their eyes were wide open, the colors of their bodies were changed, and they began to utter the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this condition they gave up their material bodies.\u201d These symptoms are prior manifestations of death.",
            "LAZINESS",
            "When, because of self-satisfaction or dislike of excessive labor, a person does not perform his duty in spite of having the energy, he is called lazy. This laziness is also manifested in ecstatic love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, when somebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere requested by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to circumambulate Govardhana Hill, they told him that they were more interested in offering benedictions than in circumambulating Govardhana Hill. This is an instance of laziness caused by self-satisfaction.",
            "Once when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, along with His cowherd boyfriends, was having a mock battle, Subala showed the symptoms of fatigue. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately told His other friends, \u201cSubala is feeling too fatigued from mock-fighting with Me. So please do not disturb him any more by inviting him to fight.\u201d This is an instance of laziness caused by dislike of excessive labor.",
            "INERTNESS",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 13 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is an appreciation by thegop\u012bsof the inertia of the cows in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Thegop\u012bssaw that the cows were hearing the sweet songs vibrated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute and were appearing to be drinking the nectar of these transcendental sounds. The calves were stunned, and they forgot to drink the milk from the milk bags. Their eyes seemed to be embracing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and there were tears in their eyes. This is an instance of inertia resulting from hearing the transcendental vibrations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute.",
            "When Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101 became disturbed upon hearing words against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, she remained inert and did not move her eyelids. This is another example of inertia caused by hearing.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, seventy-first chapter, verse 39 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is an account of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s bewilderment after his bringing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a into his home with the greatest respect. King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was very much bewildered because of his transcendental pleasure at having K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a present in his house. In fact, while receiving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira forgot himself. This is an instance of inertia resulting from the ecstasy of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There is another instance in the Tenth Canto, thirty-ninth chapter, verse 36 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going to Mathur\u0101, all of thegop\u012bswere standing behind K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and upon seeing the chariot leaving, they stood there stunned and did not move. They remained like that until the flag of the chariot and the dust thrown up by its wheels became invisible.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was once addressed by His friend thus: \u201cMy dear Mukunda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], due to their being separated from You, the cowherd boys are standing just like neglected Deities in the house of a professionalbr\u0101hma\u1e47a.\u201d There is a class of professionalbr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho take to Deity worship as a means of earning their livelihood.Br\u0101hma\u1e47asin this class are not very interested in the Deity; they are interested mainly in the money they can earn as holy men. So the Deities worshiped by such professionalbr\u0101hma\u1e47asare not properly decorated, Their dress is not changed, and Their bodies are not cleaned. They look dirty and are not very attractive. Actually, Deity worship should be done very carefully: the dress should be changed daily, and as far as possible there should be ornaments. Everything should be so clean that the Deity is attractive to all visitors. Here the example is given of the Deities in the house of a professionalbr\u0101hma\u1e47abecause such Deities are not at all attractive. The friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the absence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, were appearing like such neglected Deities.",
            "BASHFULNESS",
            "When R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was first introduced to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, She felt very bashful. One of Her friends addressed Her in this way: \u201cMy dear friend, You have already sold Yourself and all Your beauty to Govinda. Now You should not be bashful. Please look upon Him cheerfully. One who has sold an elephant to another person should not make a miserly quarrel about selling the trident that controls the elephant.\u201d This kind of bashfulness is due to a new introduction in ecstatic love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The heavenly king, Indra, upon being defeated in his fight with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for possession of thep\u0101rij\u0101taflower, became very bashful because of his defeat. He was standing before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, bowing down his head, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, \u201cAll right, Indra, you can take thisp\u0101rij\u0101taflower. Otherwise, you will not be able to show your face before your wife, \u015aac\u012bdev\u012b.\u201d Indra\u2019s bashfulness was due to defeat. In another instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to praise Uddhava for his various high qualifications. Upon being praised by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Uddhava also bowed down his head bashfully.",
            "In theHari-va\u1e41\u015ba,Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, feeling slighted by Rukmi\u1e47\u012b\u2019s high position, said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Raivataka Mountain is always full of spring flowers, but when I have become persona non grata to You, what is the use of my observing them?\u201d This is an instance of bashfulness resulting from being defeated.",
            "CONCEALMENT",
            "There is a symptom of ecstatic love known as concealment, or trying to hide one\u2019s real mental condition by externally showing another attitude. In this state of mind one tries to hide his mind by looking away in different directions, by unnecessarily trying for something that is impossible, or by using words that cover one\u2019s real thoughts. According to\u0101c\u0101ryasexpert in the study of psychological activities, these attempts at hiding one\u2019s real affections are another part of ecstatic feeling for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, thirty-second chapter, verse 15 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b states, \u201cMy dear King, thegop\u012bswere always beautiful and decorated with confidential smiles and alluring garments. In their movements, intended to give impetus to lusty feelings, they would sometimes press K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hand on their laps, and sometimes they would keep His lotus feet on their breasts. After doing this, they would talk with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as if they were very angry with Him.\u201d",
            "There is another instance of this concealment in ecstatic love. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme joker, planted thep\u0101rij\u0101tatree in the courtyard of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, the daughter of King Vidarbha, became very angry, but due to her natural gentle behavior, she did not express anything. No one could understand Rukmi\u1e47\u012b\u2019s real mental condition. This is an instance of competitive concealment.",
            "There is another instance in the First Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 32 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.After entering Dv\u0101rak\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was received in different ways by different members of His family. Upon seeing their husband from a distance, the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 immediately embraced Him within their minds and slowly glanced over Him. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came nearer, they pushed their sons forward to embrace Him. Others were trying, out of shyness, not to shed tears, but they still could not keep the tears from gliding down. This is an instance of concealment caused by shyness.",
            "On another occasion, when \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was involved with another woman, She addressed Her friend in this manner: \u201cMy dear friend, as soon as I think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the cowherd boy attached to some other woman, I become stricken with fear and the hairs on My body stand up. I must be very careful that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not see Me at such times.\u201d This is an instance of concealment caused by shyness and diplomatic behavior.",
            "It has been stated, \u201cAlthough \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b developed a deep loving affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, She hid Her attitude in the core of Her heart so that others could not detect Her actual condition.\u201d This is an instance of concealment caused by gentleness.",
            "Once when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His cowherd friends were enjoying friendly conversation, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to address His associates in casual language. At that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s servant Patr\u012b was also enjoying the conversation. But then, remembering his position of servitude, Patr\u012b bowed down before his master, and with great respect and control, he stifled his smiling. This subdued smiling is an instance of concealment caused by a respectful attitude.",
            "REMEMBRANCE",
            "There are many symptoms of ecstatic love caused by remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, one friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informed Him, \u201cMy dear Mukunda, just after observing a bluish cloud in the sky, the lotus-eyed R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b immediately began to remember You. And simply by observing this cloud She became lusty for Your association.\u201d This is an instance of remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ecstatic love because of seeing something resembling Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s bodily complexion is very similar to the bluish hue of a cloud, so simply by observing a bluish cloud, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b remembered Him.",
            "One devotee said that even when he was not very attentive he would sometimes, seemingly out of madness, remember the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart. This is an instance of remembrance resulting from constant practice. In other words, devotees who are constantly thinking of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even if they are momentarily inattentive, will see the figure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appearing within their hearts.",
            "ARGUMENTATIVENESS",
            "Madhuma\u1e45gala was an intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a coming from thebr\u0101hma\u1e47acommunity. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends were mostly cowherd boys belonging to thevai\u015byacommunity, but there were others who belonged to thebr\u0101hma\u1e47acommunity. Actually, in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana thevai\u015byacommunity and thebr\u0101hma\u1e47acommunity are considered prominent. This Madhuma\u1e45gala one day addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this fashion: \u201cMy dear friend, I can see that You are not aware of the peacock feathers that are falling on the ground, and at the same time You are unmindful of the flower garlands that are offered to You. I think I can guess the reason for Your absentmindedness when I see Your two eyes flying over to the eyes of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, just like black drones flying to lotus flowers.\u201d This is an instance of an argumentative suggestion in ecstatic love.",
            "Once while K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was out walking, one of the associates of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b told Her, \u201cMy dear friend, do You think that this walking personality is atam\u0101latree?* If He is atam\u0101latree, then how is it possible for Him to walk and be so beautiful? Then, this personality might be a cloud. But if He\u2019s a cloud, then where is the beautiful moon within? Under the circumstances, I think it may be granted that this person is the same enchanting Personality of Godhead by whose flute vibration the three worlds are captivated. He must be the same Mukunda who is standing before Govardhana Hill.\u201d This is another instance of an argumentative presentation of ecstatic love.",
            "*\u00a0Thetam\u0101latree is always described as being the same color as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "ANXIETY",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twenty-ninth chapter, verse 29 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asked all thegop\u012bsto go back to their homes, they did not like it. Because of their grief at this, they were sighing heavily and their beautiful faces appeared to be drying up. In this condition they remained, without making a sound. They began to draw lines on the ground with their toes, and with their tears they washed the black ointment from their eyes onto their breasts, which were covered with redku\u1e45kumapowder. This is an instance of anxiety in ecstatic love.",
            "One of the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once informed Him, \u201cMy dear killer of the demon Mura, Your kind and gentle mother is very anxious because You have not returned home, and with great difficulty she has passed the evening constantly sitting on the balcony of Your home. It is certainly astonishing how You could forget Your mother while You are off somewhere engaged in Your playful activities!\u201d This is another instance of deep anxiety in ecstatic love.",
            "When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was very anxiously waiting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to return from Mathur\u0101, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda gave her this solace: \u201cMy dear Ya\u015bod\u0101, please don\u2019t be worried. Please dry your beautiful lotuslike face. There is no need for you to breathe so hotly. I will go immediately with Akr\u016bra to the palace of Ka\u1e41sa and get your son back for you.\u201d Here is an instance of anxiety in ecstatic love caused by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s awkward position.",
            "THOUGHTFULNESS",
            "In theVai\u015b\u0101kha-m\u0101h\u0101tmyasection of thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47aa devotee states that though in some of the eighteenPur\u0101\u1e47asthe process of glorifying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is not mentioned and the glorifying of some demigod is offered, such glorification must be continued for millions of years. For when one studies thePur\u0101\u1e47asvery scrutinizingly, he can see that ultimately Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is an instance of ecstatic love developed out of thoughtfulness.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, sixtieth chapter, verse 39 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is an account of Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b\u2019s writing a letter to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a requesting Him to kidnap her before her marriage to another person. At that time the specific attachment of Rukmi\u1e47\u012b for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was expressed by Rukmi\u1e47\u012b as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Your transcendental glories are chanted by great sages who are free from material contamination, and in exchange for such glorification You are so kind that You freely distribute Yourself to such devotees. As one can elevate oneself simply by Your grace, so also by Your direction alone one may be lost to all benedictions, under the influence of eternal time. Therefore I have selected Your Lordship as my husband, brushing aside personalities like Brahm\u0101 and Indra\u00a0\u2013 not to mention others.\u201d Rukmi\u1e47\u012b enhanced her love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply by thinking of Him. This is an instance of thoughtfulness in ecstatic love.",
            "ENDURANCE",
            "When a person is fully satisfied due to attaining knowledge, transcending all distress or achieving his desired goal of life in transcendental devotional service to God, his state of endurance or steady-mindedness is calleddh\u1e5bti.At this stage one is not perturbed by any amount of loss, nor does anything appear to be unachieved by him.",
            "According to the opinion of Bhart\u1e5bhari, a learned scholar, when a person is elevated to this state of endurance, he thinks as follows: \u201cI do not wish to be a highly posted government servant. I shall prefer to remain naked, without proper garments. I shall prefer to lie down on the ground without any mattress. And despite all these disadvantages, I shall refuse to serve anyone, even the government.\u201d In other words, when one is in ecstatic love with the Personality of Godhead, he can endure any kind of disadvantages calculated under the material concept of life.",
            "Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, used to think, \u201cIn my pasturing ground the goddess of fortune is personally present, and I possess more than ten hundred thousand cows, which loiter here and there. And above all, I have a son like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is such a powerful, wonderful worker. Therefore, even though I am a householder, I am feeling so satisfied!\u201d This is an instance of mental endurance resulting from the absence of all distress.",
            "In another instance a devotee says, \u201cI am always swimming in the nectarean ocean of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, and as such I have no more attraction for religious rituals, economic development, sense gratification or even the ultimate salvation of merging into the existence of Brahman.\u201d This is an instance of the mind\u2019s endurance due to achieving the best thing in the world. The best thing in the world is absorption in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "HAPPINESS",
            "It is described in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47athat when Akr\u016bra came to take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma to Mathur\u0101, just by seeing Their faces he became so cheerful that all over his body there were symptoms of ecstatic love. This state is called happiness.",
            "It is stated in the Tenth Canto, thirty-third chapter, verse 11 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u201cUpon seeing that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arm was placed on her shoulder, one of thegop\u012bsengaged in ther\u0101sadance became so ecstatically happy that she kissed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on His cheek.\u201d This is an instance of feeling happiness because of achieving a desired goal.",
            "EAGERNESS",
            "In the Tenth Canto, seventy-first chapter, verse 33 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,it is said, \u201cWhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first came from His kingdom, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, to Indraprastha,* the young females of the city became so eager to see Him that even at night, when they were lying down with their husbands, they could not restrain their eagerness. Even though they were not properly dressed and although their hair was loose and there were many household duties to perform, they still gave up everything and immediately went into the street to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d This is an instance of eagerness in ecstatic love.",
            "*\u00a0Indraprastha is the present-day Delhi.",
            "In his bookStav\u0101val\u012b,\u015ar\u012b Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has prayed for the mercy of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, who was so captivated by the flute vibrations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that She immediately asked information of His whereabouts from residents in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest. Upon first seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, She was filled with such ecstatic love and pleasure that She began to scratch Her ears. The damsels of Vraja and R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b were very expert in talking cunningly, so as soon as they saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they began their talkings; and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pretending to go for some flowers for them, immediately left that place and entered into a mountain cave. This is another instance of eager loving exchanges on the parts of both thegop\u012bsand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "VIOLENCE",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was fighting with the K\u0101liya snake by dancing on his heads, K\u0101liya bit K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the leg. At that time Garu\u1e0da became infuriated and began to murmur, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so powerful that simply by His thundering voice the wives of K\u0101liya have had miscarriages. Because my Lord has been insulted by this snake, I wish to devour him immediately, but I cannot do so in the presence of my Lord because He may become angry with me.\u201d This is an instance of eagerness to act in ecstatic love as a result of dishonor to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la objected to the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the R\u0101jas\u016bya arena at a sacrifice organized by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Sahadeva, the younger brother of Arjuna, said, \u201cA person who cannot tolerate the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is my enemy and is possessed of a demoniac nature. Therefore I wish to strike my left foot upon his broad head, just to punish him more strongly than the wand of Yamar\u0101ja!\u201d Then Baladeva began to lament like this: \u201cOh, all auspiciousness to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! I am so surprised to see that the condemned descendants of the Kuru dynasty, who so unlawfully occupied the throne of the Kuru kingdom, are criticizing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with diplomatic devices. Oh, this is intolerable!\u201d This is another instance of eagerness caused by dishonor to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

Now I know both of You very well, so why should I not be very anxious to protect my daughter-in-law from Your dancing eyes?\u201d This is an instance of dishonorable words used to indirectly criticize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Similarly, some of thegop\u012bsonce began to address K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with these dishonorable words: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are a first-class thief. So please leave this place immediately. We know You love Candr\u0101val\u012b more than us, but there is no use in praising her in our presence! Kindly do not contaminate the name of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b in this place!\u201d This is another instance of dishonorable words cast upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ecstatic love.",
            "There is another statement in the Tenth Canto, thirty-first chapter, verse 16 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.When all thegop\u012bscame out of their homes to meet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a refused to accept them and asked them to go home, giving them some moral instruction. At that time thegop\u012bsspoke as follows: \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is extreme distress in being out of Your presence, and there is extreme happiness simply in seeing You. Therefore we have all left our husbands, relatives, brothers and friends and have simply come to You, being captivated by the sound of Your transcendental flute. O infallible one, You had better know the reason for our coming here. In plain words, we are here simply because we have been captivated by the sweet sound of Your flute. We are all beautiful girls, and You are so foolish that You are rejecting our association. We do not know anyone other than Yourself who would miss this opportunity to associate with young girls in the dead of night!\u201d This is another instance of indirect insults used against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ecstatic love.",
            "ENVY",
            "In thePady\u0101val\u012b,one of the friends of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b once addressed Her thus: \u201cMy dear friend, please do not be too puffed up because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has decorated Your forehead with His own hand. It may be that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is yet attracted by some other beautiful girl. I see that the decoration on Your forehead is very nicely made, and so it appears that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not too disturbed in painting it. Otherwise, He could not have painted such exact lines!\u201d This is an instance of envy caused by R\u0101dh\u0101\u2019s good fortune.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, thirtieth chapter, verse 30 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is the following statement: \u201cWhen thegop\u012bswere searching for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101 after ther\u0101sadance, they thus began to speak among themselves: \u2018We have seen the footprints of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101 on the ground of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and they are giving us great pain, because although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything to us, that girl is so cunning that She has taken Him away alone and is enjoying His kissing without sharing Him with us!\u2019\u2009\u201d This is another instance of envy of the good fortune of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b.",
            "Sometimes when the cowherd boys used to play in the forests of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would play on one side, and Balar\u0101ma would play on another. There would be competition and mock fighting between the two parties, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s party was defeated by Balar\u0101ma, the boys would say, \u201cIf Balar\u0101ma\u2019s party remains victorious, then who in the world can be weaker than ourselves?\u201d This is another instance of envy in ecstatic love.",

I request that You come to the city of Vidarbha without advertising Yourself. Then have Your soldiers and commanders suddenly surround and defeat all the strength of the King of Magadha, and by thus adopting the methods of the demons, please kidnap and marry me.\u201d",
            "According to the Vedic system there are eight kinds of marriages, one of which is calledr\u0101k\u1e63asa-viv\u0101ha. R\u0101k\u1e63asa-viv\u0101harefers to kidnapping a girl and marrying her by force. This is considered to be a demoniac method. When Rukmi\u1e47\u012b was going to be married to \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la by the choice of her elder brother, she wrote the above letter to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a requesting Him to kidnap her. This is an instance of impudence in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One of thegop\u012bssaid, \u201cMay K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sweet flute be washed away by the waves of the Yamun\u0101, and let it fall into the ocean! The sweet sound of that flute is so impudent that it makes us lose all composure before our superiors.\u201d",
            "DIZZINESS",
            "Every evening at sunset K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used to return from the pasturing ground where He herded cows. Sometimes when mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 could not hear the sweet vibration of His flute she would become very anxious, and because of this she would feel dizzy. Thus, dizziness caused by anxiety in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also possible.",
            "When Ya\u015bod\u0101 had tied K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a up one time, she began to think, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is so soft and delicate. How could I have tied Him with rope?\u201d Thinking this, her brain became puzzled, and she felt dizziness.",
            "Thegop\u012bswere advised by their superiors to bolt the doors at night, but they were so carefree that they did not carry out this order very rigidly. Sometimes, by thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they became so confident of being out of all danger that they would lie down at night in the courtyards of their houses. This is an instance of dizziness in ecstatic love due to natural affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "It may be questioned why devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be attacked by dizziness, which is usually considered a sign of the mode of ignorance. To answer this question, \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said that the devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are always transcendental to all the modes of material nature; when they feel dizziness or go to sleep, they are not considered to be sleeping under the modes of nature, but are accepted as being in a trance of devotional service. There is an authoritative statement in theGaru\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47aabout mysticyog\u012bswho are under the direct shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \u201cIn all three stages of their consciousness\u00a0\u2013 namely, wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep\u00a0\u2013 the devotees are absorbed in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, in their complete absorption in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they do not sleep.\u201d",

Therefore, please immediately dispose of the stubborn pride of this K\u0101liya serpent.\u201d By saying this, Lord Baladeva astonished the assembly of the Yadus and made them laugh for some time. Then, yawning so hard as to make ripples on His abdomen, Lord Baladeva, the bearer of the plow, returned to His deep sleep. This is an instance of sleepiness in ecstatic love.",
            "ALERTNESS",
            "A devotee once stated, \u201cI have already conquered the mode of ignorance, and I am now on the platform of transcendental knowledge. Therefore I shall be engaged only in searching after the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d This is an instance of alertness in ecstatic love. Transcendental alertness is possible when the illusory condition is completely overcome. At that stage, when in contact with any reaction of material elements, such as sound, smell, touch or taste, the devotee realizes the transcendental presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this condition the ecstatic symptoms (e.g., standing of the hair on the body, rolling of the eyeballs and getting up from sleep) are persistently visible.",
            "When \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b first saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, She suddenly became conscious of all transcendental happiness, and the functions of Her different limbs were stunned. When Lalit\u0101, Her constant companion, whispered into Her ear the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b immediately opened Her eyes wide. This is an instance of alertness caused by hearing the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name.",
            "One day, in a joking mood, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informed R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, \u201cMy dear R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, I am going to give up Your company.\u201d Upon saying this, He immediately disappeared, and because of this R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became so afflicted that the hue of Her body changed and She immediately fell down upon the ground of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. She had practically stopped breathing, but when She smelled the flavor of the flowers on the ground, She awoke in ecstasy and got up. This is an instance of transcendental alertness caused by smelling.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was touching the body of onegop\u012b,thegop\u012baddressed her companion thus: \u201cMy dear friend, whose hand is this touching my body? I had become very afraid after seeing the dark forest on the bank of the Yamun\u0101, but suddenly the touch of this hand has saved me from hysterical fits.\u201d This is an instance of alertness caused by touching.",
            "One of thegop\u012bsinformed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when You disappeared from the arena of ther\u0101sadance, our most dear friend, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, immediately fell on the ground and lost consciousness. But after this, when I offered Her some of Your chewed betel nut remnants, She immediately returned to consciousness with jubilant symptoms in Her body.\u201d This is an instance of alertness caused by tasting.",
            "One night \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was talking in a dream. \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d She said, \u201cplease do not play any more jokes on Me! Please stop! And please don\u2019t touch My garments either. Otherwise I shall inform the elderly persons, and I shall disclose all of Your naughty behavior.\u201d While She was talking like this in a dream, She suddenly awoke and saw some of Her superiors standing before Her. Thus R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became ashamed and bowed Her head. This is an instance of alertness after awakening from sleep.",
            "There is another instance of this. A messenger from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came to \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b while She was sleeping, and R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b immediately awakened. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to blow on His flute in the night, all of thegop\u012bs,the beautiful daughters of the cowherd men, immediately got up from their sleep. There is a very beautiful comparison made in this connection: \u201cThe lotus flower is sometimes surrounded by white swans, and sometimes it is surrounded by black wasps who are collecting its honey. When there is a thundering in the sky, the swans go away, but the black wasps stay to enjoy the lotus flowers.\u201d Thegop\u012bs\u2019 sleeping condition is compared to the white swans, and the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute is compared to a black wasp. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute sounded, the white swans, which represent the sleeping condition of thegop\u012bs,were immediately vanquished, and the black wasp sound of the flute began to enjoy the lotus flower of thegop\u012bs\u2019 beauty."

            "CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE",
            "Additional Symptoms",
            "All the previously mentioned thirty-three symptoms of ecstatic love are calledvyabhic\u0101r\u012b,or disturbing. All these symptoms refer to apparently disturbed conditions, but even in such disturbed conditions there is acute ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These symptoms, however, can be divided into three groups: first class, second class and third class. There are many disturbing symptoms in ecstatic love, such as envy, anxiety, pride, jealousy, conclusion, cowardliness, forgiveness, impatience, hankering, regret, doubtfulness and impudence. These are included in the thirty-three conditions of ecstatic love. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has very nicely analyzed the different kinds of disturbing symptoms, and although it is very difficult to find the exact English equivalents for many Sanskrit words used here, his analysis will now be presented.",
            "When one becomes malicious upon seeing another\u2019s advancement of life, his state of mind is generally called envy. When one becomes frightened at seeing a lightning bolt in the sky, that fearfulness brings on anxiety. Therefore, fearfulness and anxiety may be taken as one. One\u2019s desire to hide his real mentality is calledavahitth\u0101,or concealment, and a desire to exhibit superiority is called pride. Both of these may be classified under pretension. In a pretentious attitude bothavahitth\u0101and pride are to be found. One\u2019s inability to tolerate an offense committed by another is calledamar\u1e63a,and one\u2019s inability to tolerate the opulence of another is called jealousy. Jealousy andamar\u1e63aare both caused by intolerance. One\u2019s ability to establish the correct import of a word may be called conclusiveness. And before such a conclusive determination of import, there must be thoughtful consideration. Therefore, the act of consideration is present during the establishment of a conclusion. When one presents himself as ignorant, his attitude is called humility, and when there is an absence of enthusiasm it is called cowardice. Therefore, in humility, there is sometimes cowardice also. When the mind is steadfast it is called enduring, and one\u2019s ability to tolerate others\u2019 offenses is also called endurance. Therefore, forgiveness and endurance can be synonymous. Anxiousness for time to pass is called impatience, and when one sees something wonderful one is said to be struck with wonder. Impatience may be caused by being struck with wonder, and so impatience and being struck with wonder can be synonymous. When anxiety is in its dormant stage it is called hankering. Therefore, anxiety and hankering can also be synonymous. When one becomes regretful for some offense, his feeling is called bashfulness. In this way, bashfulness and regret can be synonymous. Doubtfulness is one of the aspects of argument. After exhibiting impudence one becomes restless. Therefore restlessness and impudence can be synonymous.",
            "When all such symptoms are included in ecstatic love, they are calledsa\u00f1c\u0101r\u012b,or continuously existing ecstatic symptoms. All of these symptoms are transcendental, and they are exhibited in different ways, acting and interacting under different conditions. They are like the reciprocation of love between the lover and beloved.",
            "When a person is envious or defamed, there may be a change in the color of the body. This may be classified asvibh\u0101va,or subecstasy. Sometimes illusion, collapse and strong anxiety are also considered to bevibh\u0101va.When there are many such symptoms, they can simply be grouped together under ecstatic love.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that fright, sleep, fatigue, laziness and the madness of intoxication are sometimes grouped under continuous symptoms of ecstatic love, and they are due to a strong attraction.",
            "False argument, determination, steadiness, remembrance, joyfulness, ignorance, humility and unconsciousness are also different symptoms of ecstatic love. Dependence is also grouped under ecstatic love, and this can be divided into superior dependence and inferior dependence. The direct differentiations between superior and inferior dependence are ascertained by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and will be presented in due course.",
            "One devotee exclaimed, \u201cOh, I cannot see the district of Mathur\u0101! Even though by simply hearing the name of Mathur\u0101 the hairs of my body are standing up, I cannot see the place. So of what use are my eyes?\u201d This statement reveals a strong anxiety to see the district of Mathur\u0101 resulting from a strong attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There is another instance of this strong attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expressed by Bh\u012bma when he began to murmur, \u201cMy arms are just like thunderbolts, but despite these arms I could not smash \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la while he was blaspheming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, of what use are these strong arms?\u201d In this instance Bh\u012bma became angry, and being influenced by such anger, his hopelessness became a cause for strong attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This instance can be described as strong attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in anger.",
            "When Arjuna witnessed the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose dazzling teeth were practically devouring the very existence of the universe, Arjuna\u2019s mouth became dried up. At that time Arjuna forgot himself and could not understand that he was Arjuna, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend, although he was always dependent upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy. This incident is an example of inferior dependence.",
            "Sometimes ghastly activities also support strong ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This state of mind is called ecstatic fearfulness under illusion. In the Tenth Canto, twenty-third chapter, verse 40 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is the following statement by thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho were performing sacrifices: \u201cWe have all been born into three advantageous conditions: we are in highbr\u0101hma\u1e47afamilies, we have ceremoniously received the sacred thread, and we are also properly initiated by a spiritual master. But alas, in spite of all these advantages, we are condemned. Even our observance ofbrahmacaryais condemned.\u201d Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asthus began to condemn their own activities. They realized that in spite of being so elevated by birth, education and culture, they still were under the spell of the illusory energy. They also admitted that even greatyog\u012bswho are not devotees of the Lord are covered by the influence of material energy. This kind of hopelessness felt by thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho were performing ritualistic ceremonies shows practically no attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There is another hopelessness, however, which shows attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When the bull demon attacked the damsels of Vraja, they began to cry out, \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 please save us! We are now gone!\u201d This is hopelessness with attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When the Ke\u015b\u012b demon was assassinated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa became hopeless. He said, \u201cKe\u015b\u012b-daitya was as dear to me as my own life, but he has been killed by some cowherd boy who is crude, uneducated and ignorant in fighting. Even though I have defeated the king of heaven without difficulty, still I do not know the value of life.\u201d Because this hopelessness has a slight touch of attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is considered to be a reflection of ecstatic love in hopelessness.",
            "Ka\u1e41sa once rebuked Akr\u016bra by saying, \u201cYou are such a fool that you are accepting a cowherd boy to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply because He has defeated some harmless water snake! The boy may have lifted one pebble called Govardhana Hill, but what is more surprising than that is your statement that this boy is the Personality of Godhead!\u201d This is an instance of a maliciously opposing element, caused by hopelessness in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One devotee tried to console akadambatree when the tree was lamenting because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had not touched even its shadow. The devotee said, \u201cMy dearkadambatree, do not be worried. Just after defeating the K\u0101liya snake in the Yamun\u0101 River, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will come and satisfy your desire.\u201d This is an instance of inappropriate hopelessness in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Garu\u1e0da the eagle, the carrier of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, once said, \u201cWho can be more pure than I? Where is there a second bird like me, so able and competent? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may not like me, He may not wish to join my party, but still He has to take advantage of my wings!\u201d This is an instance of hopelessness in the neutral mood of ecstatic love.",
            "The symptoms of ecstatic love are sometimes grouped under four headings\u00a0\u2013 namely, generation, conjunction, aggregation and satisfaction.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once told R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, \u201cMy dear friend, when You tried to meet Me alone in the morning, Your friend Mekhal\u0101 remained hungry with envy. Just look at her!\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was joking with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b in this way, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b moved Her beautiful eyebrows crossly. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b prays that everyone may become blessed by this movement of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s eyebrows. This is an instance of the generation of malice in ecstatic love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One night, after the P\u016btan\u0101 demon had been killed, baby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could be seen playing upon her breast. Upon seeing this, Ya\u015bod\u0101 became stunned for some time. This is an example of a conjunction of various symptoms of ecstatic love. The conjunction can be auspicious or inauspicious. That the P\u016btan\u0101 demon had been killed was auspicious, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing on her breast in the dead of night, with no one to help Him in case of trouble, was inauspicious. Ya\u015bod\u0101 was caught between auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.",
            "After K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had just learned to walk, He was going in and out of the house very frequently. Ya\u015bod\u0101 became surprised and said, \u201cThis child is too restless and cannot be controlled! He is incessantly going about the neighborhood of Gokula [V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana], and then He is coming back inside the house. I see that the child is very fearless, but in spite of His fearlessness, I am becoming more and more afraid of His falling into some danger.\u201d This again is an instance of the conjunction of two opposing elements: the child was very fearless, but at the same time Ya\u015bod\u0101 was becoming fearful of some danger. Here danger is the cause, and Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s feelings are in a conjunction of two opposing symptoms. In other words, Ya\u015bod\u0101 was feeling both happiness and doubt, or growing fear.",
            "When Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, saw her son very jubilant in the presence of the wrestlers in Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s arena, two kinds of tears were simultaneously gliding down her cheeks: sometimes her tears were warm, and sometimes they were cold. This is an instance of a conjunction of jubilation and lamentation due to different causes of ecstatic love.",
            "Once when \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was standing on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 River in the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, She was attacked by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was stronger than She. Although She externally expressed a disturbed mood from this incident, within Herself She was smiling and feeling great satisfaction. Externally She moved Her eyebrows and made a show of rejecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this mood R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b looked very beautiful, and \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b glorifies Her beauty. This is an instance of exhibiting varying feelings in ecstatic love, although the cause is one only\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Sometimes there were great festivals in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and all of the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana would assemble for these festivals. During one such festival, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was seen wearing a golden necklace given to Her by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This was immediately detected by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 as well as by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s mother, because the necklace was too long for R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s neck. At the same time R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b could see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a nearby, as well as Her own husband, Abhimanyu. So all of these things combined to make R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b feel very much ashamed, and with Her face shriveled She began to look very beautiful. In this case there was a combination of bashfulness, anger, jubilation and lamentation. This is an instance of an aggregate of symptoms of ecstatic love.",
            "Ka\u1e41sa once said, \u201cWhat harm can this boy do to me? He has no power.\u201d The next moment Ka\u1e41sa was informed that all of his friends had been killed by the boy. Then Ka\u1e41sa began to think in perplexity, \u201cShall I go immediately and surrender unto Him? But how can a great warrior do this?\u201d The next moment he thought, \u201cWhy shouldIbe afraid ofHim? There are still so many wrestlers standing to support me.\u201d But the next moment he began to consider, \u201cThe boy is certainly not common because He has lifted Govardhana Hill with His left hand. So what can I do in this connection? Let me go to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and inflict pains on all the residents there. But still I cannot even go out because my heart is trembling from fear of this boy!\u201d This condition of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s mind reveals an instance of pride, lamentation, humility, determination, remembrance, doubtfulness, anger and fear. Actually eight different symptoms comprised the mental condition of Ka\u1e41sa. This is another instance of an aggregate of symptoms in hopeless ecstatic love.",
            "One householder devotee once said, \u201cMy Lord, I am so wretched that these two eyes are never desiring to see the glorious city of Mathur\u0101. Therefore, my eyes are actually condemned. I am nicely educated, but my education has simply been used in government service. I have not considered formidable time, stronger than anything else, which creates and annihilates everything. To whom shall I leave all of my wealth and fortune? I am becoming older and older. What shall I do? Shall I execute devotional service from here at home? This I cannot do, because my mind is being attracted by the transcendental land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d",
            "This is an instance of hopelessness, pride, doubt, patience, lamentation, determination and eagerness\u00a0\u2013 an aggregation of seven different symptoms in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There is a proverb in Sanskrit that says, \u201cDisappointment gives rise to the greatest satisfaction.\u201d In other words, when one\u2019s sentiment or ambition becomes too great and is not fulfilled until after seemingly hopeless tribulation, that is taken as the greatest satisfaction. Once the cowherd boys in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were vainly searching after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for a long time, and for that reason their faces became blackened, and their complexions appeared faded. Just then they could hear on the hill a faint vibration from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute. Immediately all of them became very much gladdened. This is an instance of satisfaction in the midst of disappointment.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that although he has no expert knowledge about the sounds and meanings and mellows of the symptoms of ecstatic love, he has tried to give some examples of different varieties of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He further states that the thirty-three disturbing symptoms of ecstatic love, plus eight other symptoms, all taken together equal forty-one primary symptoms of ecstatic love. These symptoms create transformations of bodily activities as well as movements of the senses. All of them can be accepted as different feelings of the heart. Sometimes some of the feelings are quite natural. Sometimes some of the feelings are just temporary appearances. Those symptoms that are very natural always remain, both within and without the devotee.",
            "As one can detect the color of dye a cloth was soaked in by looking at the cloth, so, simply by understanding the different signs of these symptomatic features, one can understand the actual position. In other words, attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one, but because there exist different kinds of devotees, such attachment is manifested in many varieties. As clothing tinged red appears red, so the temporary appearance of a certain type of feeling can be detected or observed by the specific ecstatic symptom. In fact, all the different humors and mellows of the devotees produce various specific feelings within the mind. And according to these differences, the symptoms of ecstatic love appear in different forms and degrees. If one\u2019s heart is highly elevated, grave and magnanimous, or if one\u2019s heart is rough and crude, different symptoms of ecstatic love will appear, influenced by the condition of the heart. Actually, people cannot generally understand such different qualities of mentality, but when one\u2019s heart is very soft or gentle, these symptoms become very easily visible, and one can understand them very clearly. The heart of one who is highly elevated and grave is compared to gold. If one\u2019s heart is very soft and gentle, his heart is compared to a cotton swab. When there is an ecstatic sensation within the mind, the golden heart or grave heart is not agitated, but the soft heart immediately becomes agitated.",
            "To offer another example, a grave, magnanimous heart is compared to a great city, and a soft heart to an insignificant cottage. There may be many lights or even great elephants in the big city, but no one will take particular notice of them. But when such lights or elephants are seen near a small cottage, everyone can distinctly point them out.",
            "A hard heart is compared to a lightning bolt, to gold and to shellac. The lightning bolt is very strong and never becomes soft. Similarly, the hearts of those who are engaged in severe austerities and penances do not become very easily softened. The golden heart becomes melted at high temperature, as in ecstatic love. And the shellac heart is very easily melted in slight temperature.",
            "A soft heart is compared to honey, to butter and to nectar. And the condition of the mind is compared to sunshine. As honey and butter become melted even in slight sunshine, softhearted persons become easily melted. Nectar, however, is by its nature always liquid. And the hearts of those who are in pure ecstatic love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are by nature always liquified, just like nectar.",
            "A pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always specifically qualified with nectarean qualifications and sometimes with the qualifications of butter and honey. On the whole, the heart in any of the different conditions mentioned above can be melted under certain circumstances, just as a hard diamond is sometimes melted by a combination of certain chemicals. In theD\u0101na-keli-kaumud\u012bit is stated, \u201cWhen love develops in the heart of a devotee, he cannot check the transformation of his sentiments. His heart is just like the ocean at the rising of the moon, when the ebb tide cannot be checked: immediately there must be movement of high waves.\u201d Although in its natural state the ocean is always grave and unfathomable, when the moon rises, nothing can check the ocean\u2019s agitation. Similarly, those who are pure devotees cannot on any account check the movement of their feelings within."

            "CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO",
            "Symptoms of Continuous Ecstasy",
            "The continuous ecstasy of love can remain like a powerful king, subduing all temporary manifestations of love as well as any opposing elements of anger. It can be exhibited directly or indirectly, and thus ecstatic love can be described as direct or indirect. These symptoms of ecstatic love are possible only when one is fully situated in a transcendental position. Direct ecstatic love can be divided into two groups\u00a0\u2013 namely, selfish and selfless.",
            "When noncontradictory symptoms of ecstatic love are distinctly manifest, any contradictory symptoms create a sense of abomination. Contradictory ecstatic love is called selfish. That ecstatic love that can adjust all contradictory or noncontradictory symptoms is called direct selfless love. These selfless symptoms can again be divided into five groups: neutrality, servitude, fraternity, parenthood and conjugal love. Such ecstatic love assumes a particular mode in contact with different objects of love.",
            "NEUTRALITY",
            "Neutrality can be further subdivided into general, transparent and peaceful. An attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the people in general or by children cannot take any specific or satisfactory position. It can be manifest sometimes in trembling of the body and changing of the color of the eyes (to red, white, etc.), although there is no symptom of any particular affection.",
            "One old man was told by a young man, \u201cJust see how this child\u00a0\u2013 only three years old\u00a0\u2013 is so jubilant! Simply by seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is running so swiftly, making a tumultuous sound. Just see!\u201d This is an instance of neutral ecstatic love in the heart of a child, without any specific subdivision.",
            "Due to the different types of attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are different varieties of devotees. Their symptoms are manifested transparently, just like jewels. It is said that a great devoteebr\u0101hma\u1e47awould sometimes address the Supreme Personality of Godhead as master and sometimes joke with the Lord, using different kinds of familiar words. Sometimes he would protect the Lord with a filial affection, sometimes he would cry out to the Lord, addressing the Lord as his beloved, and sometimes he would meditate on the Lord as the Supersoul. This means that thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aexpressed his ecstatic loving symptoms in different ways at different times. But in each instance, because of ecstatic love, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47amerged himself in the ocean of happiness and became situated in pure love. Thus he was a transparent medium, like a jewel that shows reality in varying colors according to its own nature.",
            "When the great sage N\u0101rada was glorifying the pastimes of the Lord with hisv\u012b\u1e47\u0101,the four Kum\u0101ras, headed by Sanaka, although merged in the impersonal conception of Brahman, were trembling all over. Another devotee once exclaimed, \u201cAlthough I can achieve liberation simply by serving the devotees, my mind is still very much anxious to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose bodily complexion is just like a dark cloud.\u201d When a devotee is so anxious to contact the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can also be accepted as a symptom of neutral love.",
            "PURE AND MIXED FLAVORS",
            "Generally, a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be placed into one of three groups. One group consists of those who are completely dependent on the merciful affection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, another group consists of devotees who are dealing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on friendly terms, and the third group consists of those who are dealing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His superiors, with parental affection. These three classes of devotees gradually develop different relationships of transcendental mellow with the Personality of Godhead. When the attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is based on only one particular humor, that humor is calledkeval\u0101,or the pure state. One in this pure state of devotional service gradually develops the desire to follow in the footsteps of an eternal associate of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, e.g., to follow in the footsteps of Ras\u0101la, the personal attendant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, or to follow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends, like \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 and Sud\u0101m\u0101, or to follow Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101, devotees in parenthood. Ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never manifested directly with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The devotee has to follow in the footsteps of the eternal associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "When transcendental humors in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a become mixed (e.g., when the relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, servitorship and parental love become mixed together), the result is called mixed humor or flavor. Such mixed transcendental flavors are manifested by such devotees as Uddhava, Bh\u012bma and Mukhar\u0101, the personal attendant of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. Although devotional humors are sometimes found in mixtures, a particular humor is always found to be a prominent and constant factor. That prominent humor is to be accepted as the devotee\u2019s main relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, Uddhava is in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a friend, but in Uddhava\u2019s character a trace of servitude to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also visible. Such friendship is called friendship in reverence. The friendship typified by \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 and Sud\u0101m\u0101, however, is the standard of friendship without any tinge of reverence.",
            "SUBORDINATE ECSTATIC LOVE",
            "The devotees who always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a superior are in subordinate ecstatic love. To such a devotee the concept of inferiority to the Lord is very prominent, and he rarely takes interest in any other kind of transcendental loving humor with the Lord.",
            "In theMukunda-m\u0101l\u0101-stotra,compiled by King Kula\u015bekhara, one of the prayers says, \u201cMy dear Lord, You are the deliverer of living entities from the hellish condition of materialistic life, but that does not matter to me. Whether I am elevated to the heavenly platform or remain on this earthly planet or am dispatched to some hellish planet, that does not matter at all to me. My only prayer is that at the time of my death I may simply remember Your two beautiful feet, which are just like lotus flowers fructifying during the autumn season.\u201d",
            "FRIENDSHIP",
            "As far as friendship is concerned, those high-grade devotees who are almost like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are considered to be great authorities in the modes of friendly relations with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On that friendly platform there are different kinds of laughing and joking conversations. An example of such a friendly relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was once thinking, \u201cToday, while I was engaged in tending the cows in the pasturing ground of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, I went to collect some flowers in a beautiful garden. At that time My friends, the cowherd boys, were unhappy even to tolerate a two-minute separation from Me. And when they found Me, there was competition between us as to who would touch the other first with the flowers we had in hand.\u201d",
            "One friend criticized K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear D\u0101modara, although You have been defeated by \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 and have become sufficiently minimized in strength, by a false expression of strength You have somehow covered Your shameful condition of defeat.\u201d",
            "PARENTHOOD, OR SUPERIORITY",
            "When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 heard that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s cows were being forcibly moved by the strong servants of Ka\u1e41sa and that the tender cowherd boys were trying to protect their cows, she began to think, \u201cHow can I protect these poor boys from the invasion of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s servants?\u201d This is an instance of a superior attitude in a devotee.",
            "As soon as mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 found her son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returning from the pasturing ground, she immediately began to pat Him, touching her fingers to the cheeks of the Lord.",
            "CONJUGAL LOVE",
            "Above even the humor of love between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His parents is the relationship of conjugal love. The Lord and the younggop\u012bsexhibit this in different ways\u00a0\u2013 glancing, moving the eyebrows, speaking very sweet words and exchanging smiles.",
            "There is a statement in theGovinda-vil\u0101sato this effect: \u201c\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was looking for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very anxiously and almost disappointedly.\u201d When there is such an indirect expression of conjugal love, there is smiling, astonishment, enthusiasm, lamentation, anger, dread and sometimes ghastliness. These seven exchanges of conjugal love form another state of ecstatic love.",
            "In a direct relationship of conjugal love, there is laughter, astonishment, chivalry, lamentation, anger and dread, but there is no ghastliness. These expressions are considered to be great reservoirs of pleasure. When these seven kinds of ecstatic loving exchanges are manifested, they attain the status of steadiness by which the taste of conjugal love expands."

            "LAUGHTER",
            "After He had stolen some yogurt from the pots of twogop\u012bs,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told one of Hisgop\u012bfriends, \u201cMy dear beautiful friend, I can take an oath that I have not stolen even a drop of yogurt from your pot! But still your friend R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is very shamelessly smelling the flavor of My mouth. Kindly forbid Her from this devious policy of putting Her face near Mine.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking like this, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s friends could not check their laughter. This is an instance of laughter in ecstatic love.",
            "ASTONISHMENT",
            "Once Brahm\u0101 was watching all the cows and the cowherd boys dressed in yellow garments and decorated with valuable jewels. The boys were expanding their four arms and were being worshiped by many hundreds of other Brahm\u0101s. All the cowherd boys began to express their joyfulness for being with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Brahman. At that time, Brahm\u0101 showed his astonishment by exclaiming, \u201cWhat am Iseeinghere?\u201d This is an instance of astonishment in ecstatic love.",
            "CHIVALRY",
            "On the bank of the Yamun\u0101, once there was the crackling sound of dry leaves, giggling from the cowherd boys and thundering from the sky. \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 was tightening his belt to fight with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the conqueror of the demon Agha. This is an instance of chivalry in ecstatic love.",
            "LAMENTATION",
            "In the Tenth Canto, seventh chapter, verse 25 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is a description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being taken away by the whirlwind demon, T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was being thus carried up into the sky, all thegop\u012bsbegan to cry aloud. They approached mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, stating that they could not find the son of Nanda. He had been taken away by a whirlwind. This is an instance of lamentation in ecstatic love.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was fighting with K\u0101liya, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 exclaimed, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is now entrapped within the hoods of the K\u0101liya snake, and yet I am not tattered to pieces! So I must admit how wonderful is the preserving power of this material body!\u201d This is another instance of lamentation in ecstatic love.",
            "ANGER",
            "When Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, the mother of Abhimanyu, saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wearing a necklace, she could understand that the jeweled ornament had been given to Him by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. She therefore became absorbed in anger and began to move her eyebrows, expressing her anger in ecstatic love.",
            "GHASTLINESS",
            "There is a statement by Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya to this effect: \u201cSince I have begun to enjoy these transcendental exchanges of love, which are always newer and newer, whenever I remember the pleasure of past sex life, my lips curl and I wish to spit on the idea.\u201d This is an instance of ecstatic love in ghastliness.",
            "DREAD",
            "One old devotee said, \u201cMy dear Lord, when we are away from You we become so anxious to see You again, and there is great misery in our lives. But then when we do see You, there immediately comes the fear of separation. Under the circumstances, both when we see You and when we do not see You, we are subjected to different kinds of tribulation.\u201d This is an instance of a contradictory mixture of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such ecstatic love is palatable, and expert critics have compared such ecstatic love to a mixture of curd, sugar candy and a little black pepper. The combined taste is very palatable."

            "CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR",
            "The Nectar of Devotion",
            "The particular type of ecstatic loving sentiment that develops within the heart of a particular devotee is considered to bevibh\u0101va.And the resultant manifestations such as moving of the eyebrows, fear, astonishment and smiling, which have been explained hereinbefore, are calledanubh\u0101va.The different causes for developinganubh\u0101vaandvibh\u0101vaare called steady ecstasy, orsa\u00f1c\u0101ri-bh\u0101va.",
            "Whenever there is a recitation of poetry or a dramatic play on the different pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the audience develops different kinds of transcendental loving service for the Lord. They enjoy different types ofvibh\u0101va, anubh\u0101vaandsa\u00f1c\u0101ri-bh\u0101va.",
            "No one, while remaining on the material platform, should discuss these different descriptions ofbh\u0101vaandanubh\u0101vaby quoting different statements of transcendental literatures. Such manifestations are displays of the transcendental pleasure potency of the Lord. One should simply try to understand that on the spiritual platform there are many varieties of reciprocal love. Such loving exchanges should never be considered to be material. In theMah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Udyama-parva,it is warned that things that are inconceivable should not be subjected to arguments. Actually, the transactions of the spiritual world are inconceivable to us in our present state of life. Great liberated souls like R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and others have tried to give us some hints of transcendental activities in the spiritual world, but on the whole these transactions will remain inconceivable to us at the present moment. Understanding the exchanges of transcendental loving service with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is possible only when one is actually in touch with the pleasure potency of the Supreme Lord.",
            "In this connection \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives an example of the clouds in the sky. The clouds in the sky arise from the ocean, and when the clouds become water again and fall to the ground, they glide back to the ocean. Thus the pleasure potency of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is compared to the ocean. The pure devotee is the pleasure-possessing cloud, and when he is filled with transcendental loving service, then he can bestow his mercy as a downpour of rain\u00a0\u2013 and the pleasure potency returns to the ocean of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "DIRECT AND INDIRECT ATTRACTION FOR K\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e46A",
            "Transcendental pleasure derived from devotional service can be divided into two groups: direct devotional service and indirect devotional service. Direct devotional service is divided into five transcendental humors or flavors, and indirect devotional service is divided into seven transcendental humors. Direct devotional services are as follows: neutrality, servitude, fraternity, and parental and conjugal love. Indirect devotional service is divided into laughter, compassion, anger, chivalry, dread, astonishment and ghastliness. Devotional service can therefore be divided into twelve types, each of which has a different color. The colors are white, multicolored, orange, red, light green, gray, yellow, off-whitish, smoky, pink, black and cloudy. The twelve different kinds of transcendental humors are controlled by different incarnations of God, such as Kapila, M\u0101dhava, Upendra, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Nanda-nandana, Balar\u0101ma, K\u016brma, Kalki, R\u0101ghava, Bh\u0101rgava, Var\u0101ha and Matsya.",
            "Sustenance, manifestation, expansion, reflection and lamentation are the five visible symptoms in exchanges of ecstatic love. The test of devotional service can therefore be made in terms of these five symptoms. In the devotional service of neutrality there is sustenance, in chivalrous devotional service there is expansion, in compassionate devotional service there is reflection, in angry devotional service there is lamentation, and so on.",
            "An apparently pitiable condition in devotional service may appear distressing to the inexperienced student, but the feelings of the devotee in this pitiable condition are considered to be ecstatic by expert devotees. For example, the subject matter of theR\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47ais sometimes considered pitiable and distressing to the heart, but actually that is not the fact. TheR\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47anarrates how Lord R\u0101ma was sent to the forest by His father just when He was going to be enthroned. After Lord R\u0101ma\u2019s departure, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, His father, died. In the forest His wife, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, was kidnapped by R\u0101va\u1e47a, and there was a great war. When S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b was finally delivered from the clutches of R\u0101va\u1e47a, R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s whole family and kingdom, and R\u0101va\u1e47a himself, were vanquished. When S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b came home she was tried by fire, and after some days she was again banished to the forest. All of these subjects in theR\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47aseem very pitiable, and they may appear very distressing to the reciter, but actually they are not. Otherwise, why would Hanum\u0101n, the great devotee of Lord R\u0101macandra, read daily about the activities of Lord R\u0101macandra as described in theR\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47aitself? The fact is that in any of the above-mentioned twelve transcendental humors of devotional service, everything is transcendentally pleasing.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b mourns in this connection for persons who are in the fire of false renunciation, the dry speculative habit, and who neglect devotional service. Persons who are attached to the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in theVedasand to the impersonal Brahman cannot relish the transcendental pleasure of devotional service. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises, therefore, that devotees who have already tasted the nectar of devotion be very careful to protect devotional service from such dry speculators, formal ritualistic elevationists and impersonal salvationists. Devotees should protect their valuable jewel of spiritual love from the clutches of thieves and burglars. In other words, a pure devotee should not describe devotional service and its different analytical aspects to dry speculators and false renouncers.",
            "Those who are not devotees can never achieve the benefits of devotional service. For them the subject of devotional service is always very difficult to understand. Only persons who have dedicated their lives unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can relish the real nectar of devotion.",
            "When one transcends the status of ecstatic love and thus becomes situated on the highest platform of pure goodness, one is understood to have cleansed the heart of all material contamination. In that pure stage of life, one can taste this nectar, and this tasting capacity is technically calledrasa,or transcendental mood.",
            "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the second division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,in the matter of general devotional service."

            "Neutral Love of God",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b offers his respectful prayers to the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always so beautiful and for whom the pure devotees are always engaged in loving transcendental service. This third division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhudescribes the five primary kinds of devotional service\u00a0\u2013 namely, neutrality, servitude, fraternity, parenthood and conjugal love. These five items will be very elaborately explained here, and thus they have been figuratively described as the five waves on the western side of this ocean of the nectar of devotion.",
            "When one is actually able to maintain the transcendental position, his stage is called neutrality in devotional service. Some great sages have attained this neutral position by practicing austerity, penance and meditation to control the senses. Such sages are generally called mysticyog\u012bs,and in most cases they are inclined to appreciate the spiritual pleasure of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. They are practically unaware of the transcendental pleasure derived from personal contact with the Supreme Godhead.",
            "Actually the transcendental pleasure derived in association with the Supreme Person is far greater than the pleasure derived from impersonal Brahman realization, because of the direct meeting with the eternal form of the Lord. Impersonalists do not directly derive the transcendental pleasure of association with the Lord by hearing of His pastimes. As such, the impersonalists cannot derive any relishable transcendental pleasure from the topics ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,in which the Lord is personally talking with Arjuna. The basic principle of their impersonal attitude does not allow them the transcendental pleasure that is relished by a devotee whose basic principle of understanding is the Supreme Person. The impersonalistic commentary onBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is therefore disastrous, because without understanding the transcendental pleasure of theG\u012bt\u0101,the impersonalist wants to interpret it in his own way. If an impersonalist can, however, come in contact with a pure devotee, his transcendental position can be changed for greater elevation. Great sages are therefore recommended to worship the form of the Lord in order to achieve that highest transcendental pleasure.",
            "Without worshiping thearc\u0101-vigraha,the form or Deity of the Lord, one cannot understand such literature asBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.For those great sages situated in the position of transcendental neutrality, the beginning should be to take shelter of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the four-handed eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The mysticyog\u012bsare therefore advised to meditate on the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as recommended by Kapila Muni in thes\u0101\u1e45khya-yogasystem. Unfortunately, many mysticyog\u012bstry to meditate on something void, and as stated in theG\u012bt\u0101,the result is that they simply undergo trouble and do not achieve any tangible result.",
            "When some great saintly persons who had undergone penances and austerities saw the four-handed transcendental form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, they remarked, \u201cThis four-handed form of the Lord, manifested in a bluish color, is the reservoir of all pleasure and the center of our living force. Actually, when we see this eternal form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, we, along with many otherparama-ha\u1e41sas,become immediately captivated by the beauty of the Lord.\u201d This appreciation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by saintly persons is an instance of situation in\u015b\u0101nta-rasa,or the neutral stage of devotional service. In the beginning, those who are aspiring for salvation try to get out of the material entanglement by performing painful austerities and penances, and ultimately they come to the impersonal status of spiritual realization. At thisbrahma-bh\u016btastage of liberation from material entanglement, the symptoms, as explained inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,are that one becomes joyous beyond any hankering or lamentation and gains a universal vision. When the devotee is situated in the\u015b\u0101nta-rasa,or neutral stage of devotional service, he appreciates the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form of the Lord.",
            "Actually, all Vedic culture is aiming at understanding Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the\u1e5ag Vedaonemantrasays that any advanced saintly person is always aspiring to be fixed in meditation upon the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that the foolish do not know that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the ultimate goal of life. According to the conclusion of all authoritative Vedic scriptures, when a person comes to the stage of appreciating Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is at the beginning of devotional service. If one cultivates devotional service further and further, under proper guidance, other features of devotional service will gradually become manifest. At this stage of\u015b\u0101nta-rasa,one can see Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer of even the demons. The Lord is appreciated by such would-be devotees as the eternal transcendental form, the chief of all self-realized souls, the Supersoul and the Supreme Brahman. He is also appreciated as being completely peaceful, completely controlled and pure, merciful to the devotees and untouched by any material condition. This appreciation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in awe and veneration by the saintly is to be understood as the sign that they are situated in the\u015b\u0101nta-rasa,or the neutral stage of devotional service.",
            "This stage of\u015b\u0101nta-rasacan be attained by the impersonalists only when they are in association with pure devotees. Otherwise it is not possible. After Brahman realization, when a liberated soul comes in contact with a pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and submissively accepts the teachings of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without misinterpretation, he becomes situated in this neutral stage of devotional service. The best example of saintly persons situated in the\u015b\u0101nta-rasaare Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sananda and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, the Kum\u0101ra brothers. These four saintly persons (known as Catu\u1e25-sana) are sons of Lord Brahm\u0101. After their birth, when they were ordered by their father to become householders and increase human society, they refused the order. They said that they had already decided not to become entangled with family life; they would rather live as saintlybrahmac\u0101r\u012bsfor their own perfection. So these great saints have been living for millions of years now, but still they appear to be just like boys of four or five years. Their complexions are very fair, there is an effulgence in their bodies, and they always travel naked. These four saintly persons almost always remain together.",
            "In one of the prayers of the Kum\u0101ra brothers, this declaration is made: \u201cO Lord Mukunda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the giver of liberation], only so long as one does not happen to see Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge, appearing just like a newly-growntam\u0101latree, with a bluish hue\u00a0\u2013 only for so long can the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, known as Brahman, be very pleasing to a saintly person.\u201d",
            "The qualifications of a saintly person are described in theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuas follows. A saintly person is one who understands fully that simply by discharging devotional service he can become confident of liberation. He is always situated in the regulative principles of devotional life and at the same time aspires to be liberated from material entanglement.",
            "A saintly person thinks like this: \u201cWhen shall I be able to live alone in the caves of the mountains? When shall I be dressed simply with undergarments? When shall I be satisfied by eating simply a little fruit and vegetables? When will it be possible for me to think always of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence? When, in such a spiritual condition of life, shall I fully understand my days and nights to be insignificant moments in eternal time?\u201d",
            "The devotees and self-realized persons who are engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord always maintain an ecstatic love for the Lord within their hearts. Thus they are benefited by the rays of the ecstatic moon, and they are called saintly persons.",
            "The impulse of a saintly person is to be engaged in the study of theVedas,especially the Upani\u1e63adic portions; to live always in a place where there is no disturbance from the common people; to think always of the eternal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; to be ready to consider and understand the Absolute Truth; to be always prominent in exhibiting knowledge; to see the Supreme Lord in His universal form (vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa); to associate always with learned devotees; and to discuss the conclusion of theVedaswith similarly elevated persons. All of these qualifications of a saintly person serve to raise him to the status of\u015b\u0101nta-rasa.",
            "In theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuit is stated that all those who attended the pious meeting held by Lord Brahm\u0101 for the study of Vedic literature like theUpani\u1e63adsbecame overwhelmed with ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the chief of the Yadu dynasty. Actually, the result of studying theUpani\u1e63adsis to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Negation of material existence is only one of the subjects of theUpani\u1e63ads.The next subject concerns becoming situated in the impersonal realization. And then, after penetrating through the impersonal Brahman, when one comes to the platform of associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one reaches the ultimate goal in studying theUpani\u1e63ads.",
            "Those who are situated on the platform of\u015b\u0101nta-rasaget their impetus for advancement in devotional service by smelling thetulas\u012boffered at the lotus feet of the Lord, by hearing the sound of His conchshell, by seeing a sanctified place in some mountain or hill, by observing a forest like the ones in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, by going to a place of pilgrimage, by visiting the course of the Ganges River, by being victorious over the dictations of bodily demands (i.e., eating, sleeping, mating and defending), by understanding the devastation of eternal time and by constantly associating with devotees engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All these different items are favorable in elevating saintly persons situated in\u015b\u0101nta-rasato the advanced stage of devotional service.",
            "In the Third Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 43 of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,there is a statement by the four saintly persons known as Catu\u1e25-sana, headed by Sanaka Kum\u0101ra. They went to visit the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka in the spiritual sky, and when they bowed down before the Lord, the aroma of thetulas\u012b,mixed with saffron, entered their nostrils and immediately attracted their minds. Although these four saintly persons were always absorbed in the thought of impersonal Brahman, from association with the Lord and from smelling thetulas\u012bleaves the hairs on their bodies immediately stood up. This shows that even a person who is situated in Brahman realization, if he is put into association with devotees in pure devotional service, will immediately become attracted to the personal feature of the Lord.",
            "There are certain symptoms of great sages who are situated in\u015b\u0101nta-rasadevotional service, and these symptoms are exhibited as follows. They concentrate their eyesight on the tip of the nose, and they behave just like anavadh\u016bta. Avadh\u016btameans a highly elevated mystic who does not care for any social, religious or Vedic conventions. Another symptom is that such persons are very careful to step forward when giving speeches. When they speak, they join together the forefinger and thumb. (This is called thej\u00f1\u0101na-mudr\u0101position.) They are not against the atheists, nor are they particularly inclined to the devotees. Such persons give stress to liberation and detachment from the materialistic way of life. They are always neutral and have no affection for nor misidentification with anything material. They are always grave, but fully absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These uncommon features develop in devotees who are situated in\u015b\u0101nta-rasa.",
            "Regarding concentration of the eyesight on the tip of the nose, there is a statement in theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuby a devotee who observed this being performed by ayog\u012b.He remarked, \u201cThis great sage is concentrating his eyesight on the tip of his nose, and from this it appears that he has already realized the eternal form of the Lord within himself.\u201d",
            "Sometimes a devotee in\u015b\u0101nta-rasayawns, stretches his limbs, instructs on devotional service, offers respectful obeisances unto the form of the Lord, offers nice prayers to the Lord and has a desire to give direct service with his body. These are some of the common symptoms of the devotee who is situated in neutrality. One devotee, after observing the yawning of another devotee, addressed him thus: \u201cMy dear mystic, I think that within your heart there is some ecstatic devotional love which is causing you to yawn.\u201d It is sometimes found that a devotee in the\u015b\u0101nta-rasafalls down on the ground, his hairs stand up on his body, and he trembles all over. In this way, different symptoms of ecstatic trance are exhibited automatically by such devotees.",
            "In theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuit is said that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was blowing His conch shell known as P\u0101\u00f1cajanya, many great sages who were living in the caves of the mountains immediately reacted, being awakened from their trance of meditation. They immediately saw that the hairs of their bodies were standing. Sometimes devotees in\u015b\u0101nta-rasabecome stunned, peaceful, jubilant, deliberate, reflective, anxious, dexterous and argumentative. These symptoms indicate continuous ecstasy, or established emotion.",
            "Once a great realized sage was lamenting that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was living in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 but that he was unable to take advantage of seeing Him. After thinking this, the sage immediately became stunned. He was thinking that he was simply wasting his time. In other words, the sage lamented because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present but he still could not take advantage of this because of his meditation.",
            "When a mystic is transcendental to all kinds of mental concoctions and is situated in Brahman, his state is called trance, beyond the influence of the material conception of life. In that stage, when one hears about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, there may be shivering in the body.",
            "When a Brahman-realized devotee who has come to the stage of steady trance comes into contact with the eternal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his transcendental pleasure increases millions of times. One great sage once inquired from another, \u201cMy dear friend, do you think that after I perfect the eightfoldyogaperformance I shall be able to see the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?\u201d This inquiry from the sage is an instance of inquisitiveness in a devotee situated in the neutral stage of devotional service.",
            "When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, along with His elder brother Balar\u0101ma and sister Subhadr\u0101, came to Kuruk\u1e63etra in a chariot on the occasion of a solar eclipse, many mysticyog\u012bsalso came. When these mysticyog\u012bssaw Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, they exclaimed that now that they had seen the excellent bodily effulgence of the Lord, they had almost forgotten the pleasure derived from impersonal Brahman realization. In this connection one of the mystics approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and said, \u201cMy dear Lord, You are always full with transcendental bliss, excelling all other spiritual positions. And so, simply by seeing You from a distant place, I have come to the conclusion that there is no need of my being situated in the transcendental bliss of impersonal Brahman.\u201d",
            "When a great mystic was once awakened from his meditative trance by hearing the vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s P\u0101\u00f1cajanya conch shell, the mystic became overpowered\u00a0\u2013 so much so, in fact, that he began to bash his head on the ground, and with eyes full of tears of ecstatic love, he violated all the rules and regulations of hisyogaperformances. Thus he at once neglected the process of Brahman realization.",
            "Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his bookK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta,says, \u201cLet the impersonalists be engaged in the process of transcendental realization by worshiping the impersonal Brahman. Although I was also initiated into that path of Brahman realization, I have now become misled by a naughty boy\u00a0\u2013 one who is very cunning, who is very much attached to thegop\u012bsand who has made me His maidservant. So I have now forgotten the process of Brahman realization.\u201d",
            "Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura was first spiritually initiated for impersonal realization of the Absolute Truth, but later on, by his association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he became an experienced devotee. The same thing happened to \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who also reformed himself by the grace of the Lord and took to the path of devotional service, giving up the way of impersonal realization.",
            "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who gave up the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth to take to devotional service, are the best examples of devotees situated in the neutral state. According to some authorities, this condition cannot be accepted as one of the transcendental humors, orrasas,but \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that even if one does not accept it as a transcendental humor, one must still accept it as the beginning position of devotional service. However, if one is not further raised to the platform of actual service to the Lord, he is not considered to be on the platform of transcendental mellow. In this connection, in the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally instructs Uddhava like this: \u201cThe state of being established in My personal form is called\u015b\u0101nta-rasa,and without being situated in this position, no one can advance to actual pure devotional service.\u201d In other words, no one can be situated in the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without being situated at least in\u015b\u0101nta-rasa."

            "Transcendental Affection (Servitude)",
            "The transcendental mellow of affection has been accepted by authorities like \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b as a perfectional stage of devotion. It is just above the humor of neutrality and is a requisite for the development of the serving humor. In literature such asN\u0101ma-kaumud\u012bthis state of existence is accepted as continuous affection for or attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Authorities like \u015aukadeva consider this stage of affection to be in the neutral stage, but in any case this affection is relished by the devotees in different transcendental tastes, and therefore the general name for this state is affection, or pure affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Devotees engaged in servitude are attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the affection of reverence. Some of the inhabitants of Gokula (V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as exhibited on earth) are attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on this platform of affection in reverence. The inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana used to say, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always manifest before us with a complexion like a blackish cloud. He holds His wonderful flute in His lotus hands. He is dressed in yellow silks and bedecked with a peacock feather on His head. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a walks near Govardhana Hill with these personal features, all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets, as well as the inhabitants of this earth, feel transcendental bliss and consider themselves the eternal servants of the Lord.\u201d Sometimes the devotee becomes filled with the same awe and reverence by seeing a picture of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is dressed like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who has a similar complexion. The only difference is that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has four hands, in which He holds the conch shell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is always decorated with many valuable jewels, such as thecandrak\u0101ntastone and thes\u016bryak\u0101ntastone.",
            "In theLalita-m\u0101dhavaby R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b there is the following statement by D\u0101ruka, one of the servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cCertainly Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is very beautiful with His necklace ofkaustubhajewels, His four hands holding conch shell, disc, club and lotus flower, and His dazzlingly beautiful jewelry. He is also very beautiful in His eternal position, riding upon the shoulder of Garu\u1e0da. But now the same Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is present as the enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, and by His personal feature I am completely forgetting the opulence of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.\u201d",
            "Another devotee once said, \u201cThis Supreme Personality of Godhead from whose bodily pores come millions of universes, permanently rising, who is the ocean of mercy, who is the owner of inconceivable energies, who is always equipped with all perfections, who is the origin of all incarnations, who is the attraction for all liberated persons\u00a0\u2013 this very Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller and the supremely worshipable. He is all-cognizant, fully determined and fully opulent. He is the emblem of forgiveness and the protector of surrendered souls. He is munificent, true to His promise, expert, all-auspicious, powerful and religious. He is a strict follower of the scripture, He is the friend of the devotees, and He is magnanimous, influential, grateful, reputable, respectable, full of all strength, and submissive to pure love. Surely He is the only shelter of devotees who are attracted to Him by the affection of servitorship.\u201d",
            "The devotees of the Lord in servitude are divided into four classes: appointed servants (such as Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who are appointed to control the material modes of passion and ignorance), devotees in servitude who are protected by the Lord, devotees who are always associates and devotees who are simply following in the footsteps of the Lord.",
            "APPOINTED SERVANTS",
            "In a conversation between J\u0101mbavat\u012b, one of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s wives, and K\u0101lind\u012b, her friend, J\u0101mbavat\u012b inquired, \u201cWho is this personality circumambulating our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d",
            "K\u0101lind\u012b replied, \u201cShe is Ambik\u0101, the superintendent of all universal affairs.\u201d",
            "Then J\u0101mbavat\u012b inquired, \u201cWho is this personality who is trembling at the sight of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d",
            "K\u0101lind\u012b replied, \u201cHe is Lord \u015aiva.\u201d",
            "Then J\u0101mbavat\u012b inquired, \u201cWho is the person offering prayers?\u201d",
            "K\u0101lind\u012b replied, \u201cHe is Lord Brahm\u0101.\u201d",
            "J\u0101mbavat\u012b then asked, \u201cWho is that person who has fallen on the ground and is offering respect to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d",
            "K\u0101lind\u012b replied, \u201cHe is Indra, the king of heaven.\u201d",
            "J\u0101mbavat\u012b next inquired, \u201cWho is this person who has come with the demigods and is laughing with them?\u201d",
            "K\u0101lind\u012b replied, \u201cHe is my elder brother, Yamar\u0101ja, the superintendent of death.\u201d",
            "This conversation offers a description of all the demigods, including Yamar\u0101ja, who are engaged in services appointed by the Lord. They are calledadhik\u1e5bta-devat\u0101,or demigods appointed to particular types of departmental service.",
            "DEVOTEES UNDER THE PROTECTION AND SHELTER OF THE LORD",
            "One resident of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana once told Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O pleasure of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana! Being afraid of this material existence, we have taken shelter of You, for You can completely protect us! We are well aware of Your greatness. As such, we have given up our desire for liberation and have taken complete shelter under Your lotus feet. Since we have heard about Your ever-increasing transcendental love, we have voluntarily engaged ourselves in Your transcendental service.\u201d This statement is by a devotee who is under the protection and shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Upon being chastised by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s constant kicking on his head, K\u0101liya, the black snake of the Yamun\u0101, came to his senses and admitted, \u201cMy dear Lord, I have been so offensive unto You, but still You are so kind that You have marked my head with the impression of Your lotus feet.\u201d This is also an instance of one\u2019s taking shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In theApar\u0101dha-bha\u00f1janaa pure devotee expresses his feelings: \u201cMy dear Lord, I am ashamed to admit before You that I have carried out the orders of my masters named lust, anger, avarice, illusion and envy. Sometimes I have carried out their orders in a way most abominable. Yet in spite of my serving them so faithfully, they are not satisfied, nor are they kind enough to give me relief from their service. They are not even ashamed of taking service from me in that way. My dear Lord, O head of the Yadu dynasty, now I have come to my senses and I am taking shelter of Your lotus feet. Please engage me in Your service.\u201d This is another instance of surrendering and taking shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There are many instances in the various Vedic writings of persons who were aspiring after liberation by speculative knowledge but gave up this process in order to take complete shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Examples of such persons are thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asheaded by \u015aaunaka in the forest of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya.* Learned scholars accept them as devotees having complete wisdom. There is a statement in theHari-bhakti-sudhodayain which these greatbr\u0101hma\u1e47asand sages, headed by \u015aaunaka \u1e5a\u1e63i, told S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cMy dear great soul, just see how wonderful it is! Although as human beings we are contaminated with so many taints of material existence, simply by our conversing with you about the Supreme Personality of Godhead we are now gradually decrying our desire for liberation.\u201d",

            "InPady\u0101val\u012ba devotee says, \u201cPersons who are attached to speculative knowledge for self-realization, who have decided that the supreme truth is beyond meditation and who have thus become situated in the mode of goodness\u00a0\u2013 let them peacefully execute their engagement. As for us, we are simply attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is by nature so pleasing, who possesses a complexion like a blackish cloud, who is dressed in yellow garments and who has beautiful lotuslike eyes. We wish only to meditate upon Him.\u201d",
            "Those who are from the very beginning of their self-realization attached to devotional service are calledsev\u0101-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha. Sev\u0101-ni\u1e63\u1e6dhameans \u201csimply attached to devotional service.\u201d The best examples of such devotees are Lord \u015aiva, King Indra, King Bahul\u0101\u015bva, King Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, \u015arutadeva and Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka. One devotee says, \u201cMy dear Lord, Your transcendental qualities attract even the liberated souls and carry them to the assembly of devotees where Your glories are constantly chanted. Even great sages who are accustomed to living in solitary places are also attracted by the songs of Your glory. And, observing all Your transcendental qualities, I have also become attracted and have decided to dedicate my life to Your loving service.\u201d",
            "CONSTANT ASSOCIATES",
            "In the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 the following devotees are known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s close associates: Uddhava, D\u0101ruka, S\u0101tyaki, \u015arutadeva, \u015aatrujit, Nanda, Upananda and Bhadra. All of these personalities remain with the Lord as His secretaries, but still they are sometimes engaged in His personal service. Among the Kuru dynasty, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and Vidura are also known as close associates of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is said, \u201cAll the associates of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have lustrous bodily features, and their eyes are just like lotus flowers. They have sufficient power to defeat the strength of the demigods, and the specific feature of their persons is that they are always decorated with valuable ornaments.\u201d",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in the capital Indraprastha, someone addressed Him thus: \u201cMy dear Lord, Your personal associates, headed by Uddhava, are always awaiting Your order by standing at the entrance gate of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. They are mostly looking on with tears in their eyes, and in the enthusiasm of their service they are not afraid even of the devastating fire generated by Lord \u015aiva. They are souls simply surrendered unto Your lotus feet.\u201d",
            "Out of the many close associates of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Uddhava is considered the best. The following is a description of him: \u201cHis body is blackish like the color of the Yamun\u0101 River, and it is similarly as cool. He is always decorated with flower garlands first used by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he is dressed with yellow silk clothing. His two arms are just like the bolts of a door, his eyes are just like lotus flowers, and he is the most important devotee among all the associates. Let us therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Uddhava\u2019s lotus feet.\u201d",
            "Uddhava has described the transcendental qualities of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is our master and worshipable Deity, the controller of Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101, and the controller of the whole universe as well, accepts the controlling orders of Ugrasena, His grandfather. He is the proprietor of millions of universes, but still He begged a little land from the ocean. And although He is just like an ocean of wisdom, He sometimes consults me. He is so great and magnanimous, yet He is engaged in His different activities just like an ordinary person.\u201d",
            "FOLLOWERS OF THE LORD",
            "Those who are constantly engaged in the personal service of the Lord are calledanugas,or followers. Examples of such followers are Sucandra, Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana, Stamba and Sutamba. They are all inhabitants of the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, and they are dressed and ornamented like the other associates. The specific services entrusted to theanugasare varied. Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana always bears the umbrella over the head of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sucandra is engaged in fanning with the whitec\u0101marabunch of hair, and Sutamba is engaged in supplying betel nuts.

The names of theanugasin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are as follows: Raktaka, Patraka, Patr\u012b, Madhuka\u1e47\u1e6dha, Madhuvrata, Ras\u0101la, Suvil\u0101sa, Premakanda, Marandaka, \u0100nanda, Candrah\u0101sa, Payoda, Bakula, Rasada and \u015a\u0101rada.",
            "Descriptions of the bodily features of theanugasin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are given in the following statement: \u201cLet us offer our respectful obeisances unto the constant associates of the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda. They always stay in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and their bodies are decorated with garlands of pearls and with bangles and bracelets of gold. Their colors are like black bees and the golden moon, and they are dressed just to suit their particular special bodily features. Their specific duties can be understood from a statement by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, who said, \u2018Bakula, please cleanse the yellowish dress of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. V\u0101rika, you just flavor the bathing water withaguruscent. And Ras\u0101la, you just prepare the betel nuts. You can all see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is approaching. There is dust overhead, and the cows can be seen very distinctly.\u2019\u2009\u201d",
            "Among all theanugas,Raktaka is considered to be the chief. The description of his bodily features is as follows: \u201cHe wears yellow clothing, and his bodily color is just like newly grown grass. He is very expert in singing and is always engaged in the service of the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda. Let us all become the followers of Raktaka in offering transcendental loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d An example of the attachment felt by Raktaka toward Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood from his statement to Rasada: \u201cJust hear me! Please place me so that I may always be engaged in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has now become famous as the lifter of the Govardhana Hill.\u201d",
            "The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a engaged in His personal service are always very cautious because they know that becoming personal servitors of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an ordinary thing. A person who offers respect even to the ants engaged in the service of the Lord becomes eternally happy, so what is there to say of one who offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a direct service? Raktaka once said within himself, \u201cNot only is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a my worshipable and servable Lord, but also the girlfriends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thegop\u012bs,are equally worshipable and servable by me. And not only thegop\u012bs,but anyone who is engaged in the service of the Lord is also worshipable and servable by me. I know that I must be very careful not to become overly proud that I am one of the servitors and devotees of the Lord.\u201d From this statement one can understand that the pure devotees, those who are actually engaged in the service of the Lord, are always very cautious and are never overly proud of their service.",
            "This mentality of the direct servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is calleddh\u016brya.According to expert analytical studies of the direct associates of the Lord, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has divided these into three classes\u00a0\u2013 namely,dh\u016brya, dh\u012braandv\u012bra.Raktaka is classified among thedh\u016brya,or those who are always attached to serving the most belovedgop\u012bs.",
            "Onedh\u012braassociate of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the son of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101\u2019s nurse. Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 is one of the queens of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, and when she was married to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of her nurse was allowed to go with her because they had lived together from childhood as brother and sister. So this gentleman, the son of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101\u2019s nurse, used to live with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His brother-in-law, and sometimes as brother-in-law he used to play jokes with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He once addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I never tried to gain the favor of the goddess of fortune, who is married to You, but still I am so fortunate that I am considered one of the members of Your house, the brother of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101.\u201d",
            "Av\u012braassociate once expressed his pride, declaring, \u201cLord Baladeva may be a great enemy of Pralamb\u0101sura, but I have nothing to worry about from Him. And as far as Pradyumna is concerned, I have nothing to take from him, because he is simply a boy. Therefore I do not expect anything from anyone else. I simply expect the favorable glance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a upon me, and so I am not even afraid of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, who is so dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "In the Fourth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,twentieth chapter, verse 28, King P\u1e5bthu addresses the Lord, saying, \u201cMy dear Lord, it may happen that the goddess of fortune becomes dissatisfied with my work, or I may even have some misunderstanding with her, but I will not mind this, because I have full confidence in You. You are always causelessly merciful to Your servants, and You consider even their menial service to be very much advanced. So I have confidence that You will accept my humble service, although it is not worthy of being recognized. My dear Lord, You are self-sufficient. You can do anything You like without the help of anyone else. So even if the goddess of fortune is not satisfied with me, I know that You will always accept my service anyway.\u201d",
            "Devotees attached to the transcendental loving service of the Lord may be described either as surrendered souls, as souls advanced in devotional knowledge, or as souls completely engaged in transcendental loving service. Such devotees are called (respectively) neophyte, perfect and eternally perfect."

            "The causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust of His lotus feet, Hispras\u0101daand association with His devotees are some impetuses toward a devotee\u2019s engagement in transcendental loving service to the Lord.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited His causeless mercy when He was present at the departure of Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. During the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, the grandfather of Arjuna, was lying on a bed of arrows before departing from this mortal world. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and the other P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas approached Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, he was very grateful to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he addressed thebr\u0101hma\u1e47amilitary commander K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya thus: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya, just see the wonderful causeless mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! I am most unfortunate. I have no qualification. I was opposing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s most intimate friend, Arjuna\u00a0\u2013 I even tried tokillhim! I have so many disqualifications, and yet the Lord is still so kind that He has come to see me at the last point of my life. He is worshipable by all great sages, but still He is so merciful that He has come to see an abominable person like me.\u201d",
            "Sometimes the vibration of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, His bugling, His smiling, His footmarks on the ground, the transcendental fragrance of His body and the appearance of a new cloud in the sky also become impetuses for ecstatic love of Him.",
            "In theVidagdha-m\u0101dhavathere is the following statement: \u201cWhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing on His flute, Baladeva very anxiously declared, \u2018Just see how, after hearing the transcendental sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, Indra, the king of heaven, is crying in his heavenly kingdom! And from his teardrops falling on the ground, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana appears to have become a celestial residence for the demigods.\u2019\u2009\u201d",
            "Ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is known asanubh\u0101va,is symptomized by the following signs: one becomes engaged exclusively in the service of the Lord, being attentive to carry out the orders of the Lord faithfully; one becomes undisturbed and nonenvious in full transcendental loving service to the Lord; and one makes friendship with the devotees of the Lord who are situated in faithful service to Him. All of these symptoms are calledanubh\u0101va,ecstatic love.",
            "The first symptom ofanubh\u0101va,or engagement in a particular type of service, is exemplified by D\u0101ruka, a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who used to fan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with ac\u0101mara,a bunch of hair. When he was engaged in such service, he was filled with ecstatic love, and the symptoms of ecstatic love became manifest in his body. But D\u0101ruka was so serious about his service that he checked all of these manifestations of ecstatic love and considered them hindrances to his engagement. He did not care very much for these manifestations, although they automatically developed.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, eighty-sixth chapter, verse 38, there is a statement of how \u015arutadeva, abr\u0101hma\u1e47afrom the country called Mithil\u0101 in northern India, became so overpowered with joy as soon as he saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that immediately after bowing to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet he stood up and began to dance, raising his two arms above his head.",
            "One of the devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once addressed Him in this manner: \u201cMy dear Lord, although You are not a professional dancer, by Your dancing You have so astonished us that we can understand that You are personally the master of all dancing. Certainly You must have learned this dancing art directly from the goddess of love.\u201d When a devotee dances in ecstatic love, there are manifestations of symptoms which are calleds\u0101ttvika. S\u0101ttvikameans that they are from the transcendental platform. They are not symptoms of material emotion; they come from the soul proper.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, eighty-fifth chapter, verse 38, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it that after surrendering everything unto the lotus feet of V\u0101mana-deva, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja immediately caught hold of the lotus feet of the Lord and pressed them to his heart. Being overwhelmed with joy, he manifested all the symptoms of ecstatic love, with tears in his eyes and a faltering voice.",
            "In such expressions of ecstatic love there are many other subsidiary symptoms, such as jubilation, withering, silence, disappointment, moroseness, reverence, thoughtfulness, remembrance, doubtfulness, confidence, eagerness, indifference, restlessness, impudence, shyness, inertness, illusion, madness, ghastliness, contemplation, dreaming, disease and signs of death. When a devotee meets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are symptoms of jubilation, pride and perseverance, and when he is feeling great separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the symptoms of ghastliness, disease and signs of death become prominent.",
            "It is stated in the First Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eleventh chapter, verse 5 that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned from the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra to His home at Dv\u0101rak\u0101, all the residents of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 began to talk with Him as a child talks lovingly to his father after the father\u2019s return from foreign countries. This is an example of jubilation.",
            "When Bahul\u0101\u015bva, the King of Mithil\u0101, saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at his palace, he decided to offer his respects by bowing down before Him at least a hundred times, but he was so overcome by feelings of love that after bowing down only once, he forgot his position and could not rise again.",
            "In theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47aa devotee tells Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear Lord, as the sun evaporates all the water on the ground by its scorching heat, so my mental state has dried away the luster of my face and body, due to separation from You.\u201d This is an example of withering in ecstatic love.",
            "An expression of disappointment was made by Indra, the king of heaven. When he saw the sun-god, Indra told him, \u201cMy dear sun-god, your sunshine is very glorious because it reaches unto the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of the Yadu dynasty. I have thousands of eyes, but they have proved to be useless because not even for a moment are they able to see the lotus feet of the Lord.\u201d",
            "Reverential devotion for the Lord gradually increases and transforms itself into ecstatic love, then affection and then attachment. In the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,thirty-eighth chapter, verse 6, Akr\u016bra says, \u201cBecause I am going to see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a today, all symptoms of inauspiciousness have already been killed. My life is now successful because I shall be able to offer my respects unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!\u201d",
            "Another devotee in ecstatic reverential affection once said, \u201cWhen will that glorious day in my life come when it will be possible for me to go to the bank of the Yamun\u0101 and see Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a playing there as a cowherd boy?\u201d",
            "When there is no diminishing of this ecstatic love and when it is freed from all kinds of doubt, the devotee has reached the stage called steady love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this stage, all expressions of unhappiness by the devotee are calledanubh\u0101va,or ecstatic loving symptoms.",
            "The symptom of ecstatic affection with reverence felt by Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was expressed as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, You have simultaneously punished me and showed me Your causeless mercy. My conclusion is that when I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet I shall never be disturbed in any condition of life. Whether You give me the opportunity to enjoy all the yogic perfections or You put me into the most abominable condition of hellish life, I shall never be disturbed.\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, after seeing Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, told Uddhava, \u201cMy dear friend, how can I express the glorious characteristics of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the son of Virocana? Although the king of thesuras[demigods] was cursed by this son of Virocana, and although I cheated him in My incarnation as V\u0101mana, taking away his dominions throughout the universe, and although I still criticized him for not fulfilling his promise, I have just now seen him in his kingdom, and he feelingly expressed hislovefor Me.\u201d*",
            "*\u00a0Bali was a king of the demons who waged war against the demigods and nearly conquered the universe. When the demigods prayed for help, the Lord appeared as V\u0101mana-deva, a dwarfbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,and asked Bali for three paces of land. Bali agreed, and V\u0101mana covered all the worlds with His first two steps. Then He demanded to know where His third pace was to be. Bali offered his own head beneath the Lord\u2019s foot and thus became amah\u0101jana,or great devotee.",
            "When such a feeling of love becomes intensified, it is called affection. In that affectional stage, one cannot bear separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even for a moment.",
            "One devotee told D\u0101ruka, the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear D\u0101ruka, when you become like wood because of your separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is not so wonderful. Wheneveranydevotee sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his eyes become filled with water, and in separation any devotee like you would become stunned, standing just like a wooden doll. That is not a very wonderful thing.\u201d",
            "There is a statement about Uddhava\u2019s symptoms of love. When he saw Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a his eyes filled with tears and created a river that flowed down toward the sea of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to offer tribute, as a wife offers tribute to her husband. When his body erupted with goose pimples, he appeared like thekadambaflower, and when he began to offer prayers, he appeared completely distinct from all other devotees.",
            "When affection is symptomized by direct happiness and distress, it is called attraction. In such an attracted state of ecstatic love, one can face all kinds of disadvantages calmly. Even at the risk of death such a devotee is never bereft of the transcendental loving service of the Lord. A glorious example of this ecstatic love was exhibited by King Par\u012bk\u1e63it when he was at the point of death. Although he was bereft of his entire kingdom, which spread over all the world, and although he was accepting not even a drop of water in the seven days remaining to him, because he was engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b he was not in the least distressed. On the contrary, he was feeling direct transcendental ecstatic joy in association with \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b.",
            "One devotee has confidently expressed this opinion: \u201cIf a drop of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy can be bestowed upon me, then I shall feel completely carefree, even in the midst of a fire or an ocean. But if I become bereft of His causeless mercy, then even if I became the king of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, I would simply be an object for pinpricks.\u201d",
            "Devotees such as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and Uddhava are all situated in ecstatic attraction on the basis of affection, and in that state of affection a feeling of friendship becomes manifest. When Uddhava was freed from all material contamination, he saw the Lord and his throat became choked up and he could not speak. By the movements of his eyebrows alone he was embracing the Lord. Such ecstatic love has been divided by great scholars into two groups\u00a0\u2013 addition and subtraction. If a devotee is not directly associated with the Lord, it is called subtraction. In this state of love, one is constantly fixed with his mind at the lotus feet of the Lord. A devotee in this state becomes very eager to learn of the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The most important business of such a devotee is attaining the association of the Lord.",
            "In theN\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47athere is a statement about King Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku which illustrates this state of ecstatic love. Because of his great affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, King Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku became greatly attached to the black cloud, the black deer, the deer\u2019s black eyes and the lotus flower, which is always compared to the eyes of the Lord. In the Tenth Canto, thirty-eighth chapter, verse 10 of theBh\u0101gavatam,Akr\u016bra thinks, \u201cSince the Lord has now appeared to diminish the great burden of the world and is now visible to everyone\u2019s eyes in His personal transcendental body, when we see Him before us, is that not the ultimate perfection of our eyes?\u201d In other words, Akr\u016bra realized that the perfection of the eyes is fulfilled when one is able to see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was visible on the earth by direct appearance, everyone who saw Him surely attained perfection of sight.",
            "In theK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta,written by Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, there is this expression of eagerness in ecstatic love: \u201cHow miserable it is, my dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O friend of the hopeless! O merciful Lord, how can I pass these thankless days without seeing You?\u201d A similar sentiment was expressed by Uddhava when he wrote a letter to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and said, \u201cMy dear Supreme King of Vraja, You are the vision of nectar for the eyes, and without seeing Your lotus feet and the effulgence of Your body, my mind is always morose. I cannot perceive any peace under any circumstance. Besides that, I am feeling every moment\u2019s separation to be like the duration of many, many long years.\u201d",
            "In theK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btait is also said, \u201cMy dear Lord, You are the ocean of mercy. With my arms placed upon my head I am bowing down before You with all humility and sincerity. I am praying unto You, my Lord. Would You be pleased just to sprinkle a little of the water of Your glance upon me? That will be a great satisfaction.\u201d",
            "A devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, \u201cWhen even \u015aa\u015bi\u015bekhara [Lord \u015aiva] is unable to see You, what chance is there for me, who am lower than an ordinary worm? I have only committed misdeeds. I know that I am not at all fit to offer my prayers to You, but because You are known as D\u012bnabandhu, the friend of the fallen, I humbly pray that You will kindly purify me by the beams of Your transcendental glance. If I become thoroughly bathed by Your merciful glance, then I may be saved. Therefore, my Lord, I am requesting You to please bestow upon me Your merciful glance.\u201d"

But still, in spite of my reputation, my knowledge is condemned, because although enjoying the effulgence of Vedic knowledge, I could not appreciate the effulgence emanating from the nails of Your toes. Therefore, the sooner my pride and Vedic knowledge are finished, the better it will be!\u201d This is an example of indifference.",
            "Another devotee very anxiously expressed himself thus: \u201cMy mind is very flickering, so I cannot concentrate it upon Your lotus feet. And seeing this inefficiency in myself I become ashamed and the whole night I am unable to sleep because I am exasperated by my great inability.\u201d",
            "In theK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5btaBilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura has explained his restlessness as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, Your naughtiness in boyhood is the most wonderful thing in the three worlds. And You Yourself know what this naughtiness is. As such, You can very easily understand my flickering mind. This is known to You and me. Therefore, I am simply yearning to know how I can fix my mind on Your lotus feet.\u201d",
            "Another devotee expressed his impudence by saying, \u201cMy dear Lord, without considering my lowly position, I must confess to You that my eyes are just like black wasps, desiring to hover at Your lotus feet.\u201d",
            "In the Seventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,fourth chapter, verse 37, the great sage N\u0101rada informs Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira about Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was a devotee from the very beginning of his life. The proof of Prahl\u0101da\u2019s natural devotion is that even when he was a small child he did not play with his playmates but was always eager to preach the glories of the Lord. Instead of joining in their sportive acrobatic feats, he remained an inactive child because he was always in trance, meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As such, there was no possibility of his being touched by the external world.",
            "The following statement is about abr\u0101hma\u1e47adevotee: \u201cThisbr\u0101hma\u1e47ais very expert in all kinds of activities, but I do not know why he is looking up without moving his eyes. It appears that his body is fixed motionless just like a doll\u2019s. I can guess that in this condition he has been captivated by the transcendental beauty of that expert flute-player, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and being attached to Him, he is simply staring at the black cloud, remembering the bodily hue of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d This is an example of how a devotee can become inert due to ecstatic love.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Seventh Canto, fourth chapter, verse 40, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says that even in his childhood, when he was loudly speaking the glories of the Lord, he used to dance just like a shameless madman. And sometimes, being fully absorbed in thought on the pastimes of the Lord, he used to imitate such pastimes. This is an instance of a devotee\u2019s being almost like a madman. Similarly, it is said that the great sage N\u0101rada was so ecstatically in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he would sometimes dance naked and sometimes his whole body would become stunned. Sometimes he would laugh very loudly, sometimes he would cry very loudly, sometimes he would remain silent, and sometimes he would appear to be suffering from some disease, although he had no disease. This is another instance of becoming like a madman in the ecstasy of devotion.",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayait is stated that when Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was thinking himself unfit to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he immersed himself in great distress, in an ocean of unhappiness. As such, he used to shed tears and lie down on the floor as though unconscious.",
            "The students of a great devotee once talked among themselves in this way: \u201cMy dear Godbrothers, our spiritual master, after seeing the lotus feet of the Lord, has thrown himself into the fire of lamentation, and because of this fire the water of his life has almost dried away. Let us now pour the nectar of the holy name through his ears, and by our doing so the swan of his life may again show signs of life.\u201d",
            "When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to the city of \u015ao\u1e47ita-pura to fight with Bali\u2019s son B\u0101\u1e47a and to cut off all his hands, Uddhava, being separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thinking of His fight, was almost completely stunned into unconsciousness.",
            "When a devotee is fully in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there may be the following symptoms due to his feelings of separation from the Lord: a feverish condition of the body, withering of the body, lack of sleep, nonattachment, inertness, appearing diseased, madness, unconsciousness and sometimes death.",
            "As far as the feverish condition of the body is concerned, Uddhava once told N\u0101rada, \u201cMy dear great sage, the lotus flower that is a friend of the sun may be a cause of distress for us, the fire in the ocean may cause us some burning sensation, and Ind\u012bvara, the friend of the moon, may distress us in various ways\u00a0\u2013 we do not mind. But the most regrettable factor is that all of them remind us of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is giving us too much distress!\u201d This is an instance of the feverish condition which is due to being separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Some of the devotees who went to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and were detained at the door said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O friend of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dus, as the swan loves to dive into the water among the lily flowers and would die if taken from the water, so we wish only to be with You. Our limbs are shrinking and fading because You have been taken away from us.\u201d",
            "The King of Bahula, although very comfortably situated in his palace, began to think the nights very long and distressing because of his separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira once said, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the chariot driver of Arjuna, is the only relative of mine within the three worlds. Therefore, my mind is becoming maddened day and night with separation from His lotus feet, and I do not know how to situate myself or where I shall go to attain any steadiness of mind.\u201d This is another example of lack of sleep.",
            "Some of the cowherd friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O enemy of the Mura demon, just think of Your personal servant Raktaka. Simply because he saw a peacock feather, he is now closing his eyes and is no longer attentive to pasturing the cows. Rather, he has left them in a faraway pasture and has not even bothered to use his stick to control them.\u201d This is an instance of mental imbalance due to separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to the capital of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Uddhava was so afflicted by the fire of separation from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that the perspiration from his inflamed body and the tears from his eyes poured from him, and in this way he became completely stunned.",
            "When \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to seek out the Syamantaka jewel and He was late returning home, Uddhava became so afflicted that the symptoms of disease became manifest on his body. Actually, due to his excessive ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Uddhava became known in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 as crazy. To his great fortune, on that day Uddhava\u2019s reputation as a crazy fellow was firmly established. Uddhava\u2019s craziness was practically proved when he went to Raivataka Hill to minutely observe the congested black clouds. In his disturbed condition, he began to pray to these clouds, and he expressed his jubilation by bowing down before them.",
            "Uddhava informed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear leader of the Yadu dynasty, Your servants in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana cannot sleep at night thinking of You, so now they are all lying down on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 almost paralyzed. And it appears that they are almost dead, because their breathing is very slow.\u201d This is an instance of becoming unconscious due to separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was once informed, \u201cYou are the life and soul of all the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. So because You have left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, all of the servitors of Your lotus feet there are suffering. It is as if the lakes filled with lotus flowers have dried up from the scorching heat of separation from You.\u201d In the example given here, the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are compared to lakes filled with lotus flowers, and because of the scorching heat of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the lakes\u00a0\u2013 along with the lotus flowers of their lives\u00a0\u2013 are being burned up. And the swans in the lakes, who are compared to the vitality of the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, are no longer desiring to live there. In other words, because of the scorching heat, the swans are leaving the lakes. This metaphor is used to describe the condition of the devotees separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "Ways of Meeting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees meet, the meeting is technically calledyoga,or linking up with the Lord. Such meetings between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees can be divided into three classes\u00a0\u2013 namely, perfection, satisfaction and steadiness.",
            "When the devotee meets with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in great eagerness, that state of meeting is called perfection. In theK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta,Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a meets His devotee\u00a0\u2013 with peacock feather on His head, withmarakatajewels on His chest and with His ever-enchanting smile, His restless eyes and His very delicate body.",
            "In the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,thirty-eighth chapter, verse 34, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, as soon as Akr\u016bra the chariot driver saw Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His elder brother Balar\u0101ma in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he immediately got down from the chariot and, being greatly afflicted by affection for the transcendental Lord, fell down upon His lotus feet to offer respectful obeisances.\u201d These are some of the instances of perfectional meetings with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When a devotee meets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after long separation, the meeting is one of satisfaction. In the First Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eleventh chapter, verse 10, it is stated that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned to His capital, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the inhabitants said, \u201cDear Lord, if You remain in foreign countries for so long, we shall certainly be bereft of seeing Your smiling face! Upon observing Your face, we, Your eternal servitors, become greatly satisfied. All the anxieties of our existence are immediately mitigated. If we cannot see You because You are long absent from Dv\u0101rak\u0101, then it will be impossible for us to live anymore.\u201d This is an instance of satisfaction in meeting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after long separation.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal servant, D\u0101ruka, seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the door of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, forgot to offer Him respects with folded hands.",
            "When a devotee is ultimately situated in association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his position is called steadiness in devotional service. This steady position in devotional service is explained in the book known asHa\u1e41sa-d\u016bta.It is described there how Akr\u016bra, who was considered by thegop\u012bsto be terror personified, would talk with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the activities of the Kuru dynasty. A similar steady position was held by Uddhava, the disciple of B\u1e5bhaspati. He would always massage the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a while kneeling down on the ground before Him.",
            "When a devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord, he is said to have reached the attainment ofyoga.The English equivalent of the wordyogais \u201clinking up.\u201d So actual linking up with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, begins when the devotee renders service unto Him. Devotees situated in the transcendentalrasaof servitorship render their particular service whenever there is an opportunity. Sometimes they sit down in front of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to receive orders. Some persons are reluctant to accept this level of devotional service as actualbhakti-yoga,and in some of thePur\u0101\u1e47asalso this servitorship in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not accepted as the actualbhakti-yogasystem. But\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamhas clearly indicated that the servitor relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the actual beginning ofyogarealization.",
            "In the Eleventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,third chapter, verse 32, it is stated that when devotees are engaged in the discharge ofbhakti-yoga,sometimes they cry from thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sometimes they laugh, sometimes they become jubilant and sometimes they talk in very uncommon ways. Sometimes they dance, sometimes they sing, sometimes they are actually engaged in the service of the Lord, and sometimes they sit down silently as if absorbed in trance.",
            "Similarly, in the Seventh Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,chapter seven, verse 34, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says to his friends, \u201cMy dear friends, as soon as pure devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a hear of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, who is the eternal reservoir of pastimes, or hear about His transcendental qualities, they become overpowered with jubilation. Ecstatic symptoms are manifested in their bodies. They shed tears, talk falteringly, glorify the Lord in a loud voice and chant and dance in ecstasy. These ecstasies are always there, but sometimes they overcome all limits, and the symptoms become manifest to all.\u201d",
            "In the process of surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead there are six items: to accept everything favorable for devotional service, to reject everything unfavorable for devotional service, to believe that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will always give protection, to identify oneself with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees, always to feel inability without the help of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always to think oneself inferior to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one may have full capacity to perform something on his own. When one is substantially convinced that he is always protected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in all circumstances, that feeling is called reverential devotion. Reverential devotion is executed in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and with His other protected devotees.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was residing in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, some of the elderly members of the Yadu family would occasionally put some important matter before Him. At such a time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would carefully give attention to those matters. And if there were some humorous topics mentioned, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would immediately respond with a smiling face. Sometimes when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was executing His duties in the assembly known as Sudharm\u0101, He would ask the elderly members for good advice. By such activities He is manifest as the supreme spiritual master, the supreme executive head, the superior intelligence and the supreme power, protector and maintainer."

            "CHAPTER FORTY",
            "Reverential Devotion of Sons and Other Subordinates",
            "True reverential devotion is exhibited by persons who think themselves subordinate to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and by persons who think themselves sons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The best examples of this subordination are S\u0101ra\u1e47a, Gada and Subhadr\u0101. They were all members of the Yadu dynasty, and they always used to think themselves protected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons, such as Pradyumna, C\u0101rude\u1e63\u1e47a and S\u0101mba, felt the same way. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had many sons in Dv\u0101rak\u0101. He begot ten sons by each of His 16,108 queens, and all of these sons, headed by Pradyumna, C\u0101rude\u1e63\u1e47a and S\u0101mba, used to think themselves always protected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons dined with Him, they would sometimes open their mouths for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to feed them. Sometimes when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would pat one of His sons, the son would sit on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lap, and while K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was blessing the son\u2019s head by smelling it, the others would shed tears, thinking how many pious activities he must have performed in his previous life. Out of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s many sons, Pradyumna, a son of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s chief queen, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, is considered the leader. Pradyumna\u2019s bodily features resemble K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s exactly. Pure devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a glorify Pradyumna because he is so fortunate: like father, like son.",
            "There is a description in theHari-va\u1e41\u015baof Pradyumna\u2019s activities when he kidnapped Prabh\u0101vat\u012b. Pradyumna addressed Prabh\u0101vat\u012b at that time and said, \u201cMy dear Prabh\u0101vat\u012b, just look at the head of our family, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself, the supreme driver of Garu\u1e0da, and He is our supreme master. Because we have become so proud and confident of His protecting us, we sometimes do not even care about fighting with Tripur\u0101ri [Lord \u015aiva].\u201d",
            "There are two kinds of devotees engaged in devotional service with awe and veneration\u00a0\u2013 the Lord\u2019s subordinates and His sons. The servitors in the abode of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 always worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the most respectable and revered Personality of Godhead. They are captivated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of His superexcellent opulences. The members who always thought themselves protected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could readily convert their conviction into practical demonstration, because it was sometimes found that the sons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acted very unlawfully in various places but were nonetheless given full protection by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma.",
            "Even Balar\u0101ma, the elder brother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sometimes unknowingly offered respect to Him. Once when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came before Lord Balar\u0101ma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was anxious to offer His respects to His elder brother, but at that time Balar\u0101ma\u2019s club was lowered down upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet. In other words, the club in Balar\u0101ma\u2019s hand offered its own respects to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These feelings of subordination, as explained above, are sometimes manifested asanubh\u0101va.",
            "When demigods from the heavenly planets came to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons followed them, and Lord Brahm\u0101 sprinkled water from hiskama\u1e47\u1e0daluupon them. When the demigods came before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the sons, instead of sitting on golden chairs, sat down on the floor, which was covered with deerskin.",
            "Sometimes the behavior of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons appears similar to the behavior of His personal servants. For example, the sons used to offer their obeisances, they were silent, submissive and gentle, and they were always ready to carry out K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s orders, even at the risk of life. When present before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they bowed down on the ground. They were very silent and steady, and they used to restrain coughing and laughing before the Lord. Also, they never discussed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes in conjugal love. In other words, devotees who are engaged in reverential devotional service should not discuss the conjugal love affairs of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one should claim his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unless he is liberated. In the conditioned state of life, the devotees have to execute the prescribed duties as recommended in the codes of devotional service. When one is mature in devotional service and is a realized soul, he can know his own eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not artificially try to establish some relationship. In the premature stage it is sometimes found that a lusty, conditioned person will artificially try to establish some relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in conjugal love. The result of this is that one becomespr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101,or one who takes everything very cheaply. Although such persons may be very anxious to establish a relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in conjugal love, their conditioned life in the material world is still most abominable. A person who has actually established his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can no longer act on the material plane, and his personal character cannot be criticized.",
            "When Cupid came on one occasion to visit Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some devotee addressed him thus: \u201cMy dear Cupid, because you have been so fortunate as to have placed your eyesight on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the drops of perspiration on your body have become frozen, and they resembleka\u1e47\u1e6dak\u012bfruits [a kind of small fruit found in thorny bushes].\u201d These are signs of ecstasy and veneration for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the princes of the Yadu dynasty heard the vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s P\u0101\u00f1cajanya conch shell, the hairs on their bodies immediately stood up in ecstatic jubilation. It seemed at that time that all the hairs on the bodies of the princes were dancing in ecstasy.",
            "In addition to jubilation, there are sometimes symptoms of disappointment. Pradyumna once addressed S\u0101mba with these words: \u201cMy dear S\u0101mba, you are such a glorified personality! I have seen that once when you were playing on the ground, your body became covered with dust; yet our father, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, still took you up on His lap. But I am so unfortunate that I could never get such love from our father!\u201d This statement is an example of disappointment in love.",
            "To regard K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one\u2019s superior is called reverential feeling, and when, in addition to this, a devotee feels that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is his protector, his transcendental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is increased, and his combined feelings are called reverential devotion. When this steady reverential devotion increases further, it is called love of Godhead in reverential devotion. Attraction and affection are two prominent symptoms of this stage. In this reverential devotional attitude, Pradyumna never talked to his father in a loud voice. In fact, he never so much as unlocked the lips of his mouth, nor did he ever show his face filled with tears. He would always glance only at the lotus feet of his father.",
            "There is another example of steady and fixed love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the instance of Arjuna\u2019s informing Him of the death of Arjuna\u2019s son, Abhimanyu, who was also the nephew of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Abhimanyu was the son of Subhadr\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s younger sister. He was killed at the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra by the combined efforts of all the commanders in King Duryodhana\u2019s army\u00a0\u2013 namely, Kar\u1e47a, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, Jayadratha, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. In order to assure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that there was no change of love on Subhadr\u0101\u2019s part, Arjuna informed Him, \u201cAlthough Abhimanyu was killed almost in Your presence, Subhadr\u0101\u2019s love for You is not agitated at all, nor has it even slightly changed its original color.\u201d",
            "The affection that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has for His devotees was expressed by Him when He asked Pradyumna not to feel so bashful before Him. He addressed Pradyumna thus: \u201cMy dear boy, just give up your feeling of inferiority, and do not hang your neck. Just talk with Me in a clear voice and do not shed tears. You may look straight at Me, and you may place your hands on My body without any hesitation. There is no need of exhibiting so much reverence before your father.\u201d",
            "Pradyumna\u2019s attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was always exhibited by his action. Whenever he was ordered by his father to execute something, he would immediately execute the order, taking the task as nectarean even though it may have been poison. Similarly, whenever he would find something to be disapproved of by his father, he would immediately reject it as poison, even though it may have been nectarean.",
            "Pradyumna\u2019s attachment in anxiety for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was expressed when he said to his wife Rati, \u201cThe enemy, \u015aambara, is already killed. Now I am very anxious to see my father, who is my spiritual master and who always carries the conch shell known as P\u0101\u00f1cajanya.\u201d Pradyumna felt great separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He was absent from Dv\u0101rak\u0101 at the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. He said, \u201cSince my father has left Dv\u0101rak\u0101, I do not take much pleasure in practicing fighting, nor am I interested in any kind of sporting pastimes. And what need is there to speak of these things? I do not even wish to stay at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 in the absence of my father.\u201d",
            "When Pradyumna came back home after killing \u015aambar\u0101sura and saw his father, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, before him, he at once became so overjoyed that he himself could not understand his joy on that occasion. This is an instance of success in separation. A similar satisfaction was observed when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned from the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra to His home at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. All of His sons were so overjoyed that out of ecstasy they repeatedly made many mistakes. These mistakes were a sign of complete satisfaction.",
            "Every day Pradyumna looked over K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet with tears in his eyes. These signs of reverential devotion on the part of Pradyumna may be described in the same way they have been described in the cases of other devotees."

            "CHAPTER FORTY-ONE",
            "Fraternal Devotion",
            "When a devotee is permanently situated in devotional service, and by different symptoms of ecstasy he has developed and matured a fraternal mellow or flavor in relationship with the Personality of Godhead, his feeling is called fraternal love of Godhead.",
            "The impetus for such fraternal love of God is God Himself. When one is liberated and discovers his eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord, the Lord Himself becomes the impetus for increasing fraternal love. The eternal associates of the Lord in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana have described this as follows: \u201cThe Lord, Hari, whose bodily hue is like theindran\u012blajewel, whose smiling is as beautiful as thekundaflower, whose silk dress is as yellow as golden autumn foliage, whose chest is beautified with garlands of flowers and who is always playing upon His flute\u00a0\u2013 this enemy of the Agha demon is always attracting our hearts by wandering about V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d",
            "There are similar statements of fraternal love expressed outside the jurisdiction of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. When the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, headed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His four-handed form on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, holding His conch shell, disc, club and lotus flower, they completely forgot themselves and became merged in the ocean of nectarean happiness. This shows how the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du\u00a0\u2013 King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Bh\u012bma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva\u00a0\u2013 were all caught up in fraternal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Sometimes the different names, forms, paraphernalia and transcendental qualities provoke fraternal love. For instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s nice dress, His strongly built body, the all-auspicious symptoms on His body, His knowledge of different languages, His learned teachings inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,His uncommon genius in all fields of endeavor, His exhibition of expert knowledge, His mercy, His chivalry, His behavior as a conjugal lover, His intelligence, His forgiveness, His attraction for all kinds of men, His opulence and His happiness all provoke fraternal love.",
            "The impetus to fraternal love upon seeing the associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is also very natural, for their personal bodily features, their qualities and their dress are all equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. These associates are always happy in their service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are generally known asvayasyas,or friends of the same age. Thevayasyasare fully confident of protection by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Devotees sometimes pray, \u201cLet us offer our respectful obeisances unto thevayasyasof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who are firmly convinced of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friendship and protection and whose devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ever fixed. They are fearless, and on a level equal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they discharge their transcendental loving devotional service.\u201d Such eternalvayasyasare also found beyond the jurisdiction of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in places such as Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and Hastin\u0101pura. Except for V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, all the places of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes are calledpuras(towns). Mathur\u0101 and Hastin\u0101pura, the capital of the Kurus, are bothpuras.Personalities like Arjuna, Bh\u012bma, Draupad\u012b and \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 Br\u0101hma\u1e47a are counted among K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s fraternal devotees in thepuras.",
            "How the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, enjoy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association is described as follows: \u201cWhen \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arrived in Indraprastha, the capital of the Kurus, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira immediately came out to smell the flavor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s head.\u201d It is the Vedic custom that a superior smells the heads of his subordinates when the subordinates offer respect to the superior by touching his feet. Similarly, Arjuna and Bh\u012bma embraced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with great jubilation, and the two younger brothers, namely, Nakula and Sahadeva, touched the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with tears in their eyes and offered their respects. In this way all the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava brothers enjoyed the fraternal friendship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in transcendental mellow. Of the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, Arjuna is the most intimately connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He has a nice bow called G\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bva in his hand. His thighs are compared to the trunks of elephants, and his eyes are always reddish. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are together on a chariot, they become celestial beauties, pleasing to the eyes of everyone. It is said that once Arjuna was lying on his bed with his head upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lap and was talking and joking with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in great relaxation, enjoying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s company with smiling and great satisfaction.",
            "As far as thevayasyas(friends) in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are concerned, they become greatly distressed when they cannot see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even for a moment.",
            "There is the following prayer by a devotee for thevayasyasin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana: \u201cAll glories to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019svayasyas,who are just like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in their age, qualities, pastimes, dress and beauty. They are accustomed to playing on their flutes made of palm leaves, and they all have buffalo-horn bugles ornamented like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s with jewels such asindran\u012blaand with gold and coral. They are always jubilant like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. May these glorious companions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always protect us!\u201d",
            "Thevayasyasin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are in such intimate friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that sometimes they think themselves as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Here is an instance of such friendly feeling: When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was holding up Govardhana Hill with His left hand, thevayasyassaid, \u201cDear friend, You have been standing for the last seven days and nights without any rest. This is very troublesome for us, because we see that You have undertaken a severely laborious task. We think, therefore, that You need not continue to stand in that way holding the hill. You can just transfer it onto Sud\u0101m\u0101\u2019s hand. We are very much aggrieved to see You in this position. If you think that Sud\u0101m\u0101 is not able to support Govardhana Hill, then at least You should change hands. Instead of supporting it with Your left hand, please transfer it to Your right hand, so that we can give Your left hand a massage.\u201d This is an instance of intimacy, showing how much thevayasyasconsidered themselves to be equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, twelfth chapter, verse 11, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead to the learned transcendentalist, He is the supreme happiness for the impersonalist, He is the supreme worshipable Deity for the devotee, and He is just like an ordinary boy to one who is under the spell ofm\u0101y\u0101.And just imagine\u00a0\u2013 these cowherd boys are now playing with the Supreme Person as though they were on an equal level! By this anyone can understand that these boys must have accumulated heaps of the results of pious activities to enable them to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in such intimate friendship.\u201d",
            "There is a description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feeling for Hisvayasyasin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He once said to Balar\u0101ma, \u201cMy dear brother, when My companions were being devoured by the Agh\u0101sura, hot tears poured down from My eyes. And as they were washing My cheeks, My dear elder brother, for at least one moment I completely lost Myself.\u201d",
            "Within Gokula, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019svayasyasare generally divided into four groups: (1) well-wishers, (2) friends, (3) confidential friends and (4) intimate friends. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s well-wisher friends are a little bit older than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they have some parental affection for Him. Because of their being older than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they always try to protect Him from any harm. As such, they sometimes bear weapons so that they can chastise any mischievous persons who want to do harm to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Counted among the well-wisher friends are Subhadra,* Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bbhadra, Bhadravardhana, Gobha\u1e6da, Yak\u1e63a, Indrabha\u1e6da, Bhadr\u0101\u1e45ga, V\u012brabhadra, Mah\u0101gu\u1e47a, Vijaya and Balabhadra. They are older than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and are always thinking of His welfare.",
            "*\u00a0Not to be confused with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sister, Subhadr\u0101.",
            "One of the elderly friends said, \u201cMy dear Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bbhadra, why are you wielding a shining sword as though you were running toward Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura to kill him? My dear Baladeva, why are You unnecessarily bearing that heavy plow? My dear Vijaya, don\u2019t be unnecessarily agitated. My dear Bhadravardhana, there is no need to make these threatening motions. If you will all look more closely you will see that it is only a thundercloud upon Govardhana Hill; it is not the Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura in the shape of a bull, as you have imagined.\u201d These older, well-wishing friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had imagined a large cloud to be the Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura, appearing in the shape of a huge bull. In the midst of their excitement one of them ascertained that it was actually only a cloud on Govardhana Hill. He therefore informed the others not to take the trouble of worrying about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because there was no present danger from Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101sura.",
            "Among the well-wisher friends, Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bbhadra and Balabhadra are the chiefs. Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bbhadra is described as follows: His complexion is yellowish, and his dress is very attractive. He always carries a stick of various colors. He wears a peacock feather on his head and always looks very beautiful. Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bbhadra\u2019s attitude is revealed in this statement: \u201cMy dear friends, our beloved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is now very tired from working with the cows in the pasturing grounds and from traveling all over the forests. I can see that He is very fatigued. Let me massage His head silently while He is taking rest in His house. And you, Subala\u00a0\u2013 you just massage His thighs.\u201d",
            "One devotee described the personal beauty of Baladeva as follows \u201cLet me take shelter of the lotus feet of Balar\u0101ma, whose beauty is enhanced by the earrings touching His cheeks. His face is decorated withtilakamade fromkast\u016br\u012b[musk], and His broad chest is decorated with a garland ofgu\u00f1j\u0101[small conch shells]. His complexion is as white as an autumn cloud, He wears garments of blue color, and His voice is very grave. His arms are very long, touching His thighs, and He has shown His great strength by killing the Pralamba demon. Let me take shelter of this chivalrous Balar\u0101ma.\u201d*",
            "*\u00a0Balar\u0101ma and Baladeva are different names for the same expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s elder brother.",
            "Baladeva\u2019s affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is illustrated in this statement to Subala: \u201cMy dear friend, please inform K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not to go to K\u0101liya\u2019s lake today. Today is His birthday, and so I wish to go along with mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 to bathe Him. Tell Him He should not leave the house today.\u201d This shows how Balar\u0101ma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s elder brother, took care of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with parental love, within the scope of fraternal affection.",
            "Friends who are younger than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who are always attached to Him and who give Him all kinds of service are called ordinary friends, or, simply, friends. Such ordinary friends are calledsakh\u0101s,and the names of somesakh\u0101sare Vi\u015b\u0101la, V\u1e5b\u1e63abha, Ojasv\u012b, Devaprastha, Var\u016bthapa, Maranda, Kusum\u0101p\u012b\u1e0da, Ma\u1e47ibandha and Karandhama. All of thesesakh\u0101friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a seek only to serve Him. Sometimes some of them would rise early in the morning and immediately go to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s place and wait at the door to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to accompany Him to the pasturing grounds. In the meantime, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would be dressed by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and when she would see a boy standing at the door, she would call him, \u201cWell, Vi\u015b\u0101la, why are you standing there? Come here!\u201d So with the permission of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, he would immediately enter the house. And while mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was dressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he would try to help put on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s ankle bells, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would jokingly strike him with His flute. Then mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 would call, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what is this? Why are You teasing Your friend?\u201d And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would laugh, and the friend would also laugh. These are some of the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019ssakh\u0101s.Sometimes thesakh\u0101swould take care of the cows who were going hither and thither. They would tell K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cYour cows were going off here and there,\u201d and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would thank them.",
            "Sometimes when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Hissakh\u0101swent to the pasturing ground, Ka\u1e41sa would send a demon to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, almost every day there was a fight with some different kind of demon. After fighting with a demon, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would feel fatigued, the hairs on His head would be scattered, and thesakh\u0101swould immediately come and try to relieve Him in different ways. Some friends would say, \u201cMy dear Vi\u015b\u0101la, please take this fan of lotus leaves and fan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He may feel some comfort. Var\u016bthapa, you just brush the scattered hairs on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s head which have fallen upon His face. V\u1e5b\u1e63abha, don\u2019t talk unnecessarily! Immediately massage K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body. His arms have become tired from fighting and wrestling with that demon. Oh, just see how our friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has become tired!\u201d These are some examples of the treatment given to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by thesakh\u0101s.",
            "One of thesakh\u0101s,known as Devaprastha, is described as follows. He is very strong, a ready scholar, and is very expert in playing ball. He wears a white dress, and he ties his hair into a bunch with a rope. Whenever there is a fight between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the demons, Devaprastha is the first to help, and he fights just like an elephant.",
            "One of thegop\u012bsonce said to her friend, \u201cMy dear beautiful friend, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, was taking rest within the cave of a hill, He was keeping His head on the arms of \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, and He was putting His left hand on D\u0101m\u0101\u2019s chest. Taking this opportunity, Devaprastha, out of his strong affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, immediately began to massage His legs.\u201d Such are the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends out on the pasturing grounds.",
            "The more confidential friends are calledpriya-sakh\u0101sand are almost K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s age. Because of their very confidential friendship, their behavior is only on the basis of pure friendship. The behavior of other friends is on the ground of parental love or servitude, but the basic principle of the confidential friends is simply friendship on an equal level. Some confidential friends are as follows: \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, Sud\u0101m\u0101, D\u0101m\u0101, Vasud\u0101m\u0101, Ki\u1e45ki\u1e47i, Stoka-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, A\u1e41\u015bu, Bhadrasena, Vil\u0101s\u012b, Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka, Vi\u1e6da\u1e45ka and Kalavi\u1e45ka. By their various activities in different pastimes, all of these friends used to give transcendental pleasure to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The behavior of these confidential friends is described by a friend of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b who told R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, \u201cMy dear graceful R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Your intimate friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also served by His intimate boyfriends. Some of them cut jokes with Him in mild voices and please Him very much by this.\u201d For example, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had onebr\u0101hma\u1e47afriend whose name was Madhuma\u1e45gala. This boy would joke by playing the part of a greedybr\u0101hma\u1e47a.Whenever the friends ate, he would eat more than all others, especiallyla\u1e0d\u1e0dus,of which he was very fond. Then after eating morela\u1e0d\u1e0dusthan anyone else, Madhuma\u1e45gala would still not be satisfied, and he would say to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cIf You give me one morela\u1e0d\u1e0du,then I shall be pleased to give You my blessings so that Your friend R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b will be very much pleased with You.\u201d Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asare supposed to give blessings to thevai\u015byas(farming and merchant caste), and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a presented Himself as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, avai\u015bya;so thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aboy was right in giving blessings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was very pleased by His friend\u2019s blessings, and He would supply him with more and morela\u1e0d\u1e0dus.",
            "Sometimes a confidential friend would come before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and embrace Him with great affection and love. Another friend would then come up from the rear and cover K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eyes with his hands. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would always feel very happy by such dealings with His confidential friends.",
            "Out of all these confidential friends, \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 is considered to be the chief. \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 used to put on a yellow-colored dress. He would carry a buffalo horn, and his turban was of a reddish copper color. His bodily complexion was blackish, and around his neck there was a nice garland. He would always challenge K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in joking friendship. Let us pray to \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 to bestow his mercy upon us!",
            "Sometimes \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 used to address K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cOh, You are so cruel that You left us alone on the bank of the Yamun\u0101, and we were all mad from not seeing You there! Now it is our great fortune that we are able to see You here. If You want to pacify us, You must embrace each one of us with Your arms. But believe me, my dear friend, a moment\u2019s absence from You creates great havoc, not only for us but for the cows also. Everything becomes disarranged, and we become mad after You.\u201d",
            "There are other friends who are still more confidential. They are calledpriya-narm\u0101,or intimate friends. Counted among thepriya-narm\u0101friends are Subala, Arjuna, Gandharva, Vasanta and Ujjvala. There was talk among the friends of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, thegop\u012bs,about these most intimate friends. Onegop\u012baddressed R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u015b\u0101\u1e45g\u012b [delicate one], just see how Subala is whispering Your message into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s ear, how he is delivering the confidential letter of \u015ay\u0101m\u0101-d\u0101s\u012b silently into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hand, how he is delivering the betel nuts prepared by P\u0101lik\u0101 into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mouth, and how he is decorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with the garland prepared by T\u0101rak\u0101. Did you know, my dear friend, that all these most intimate friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are always engaged in His service in this way?\u201d Out of the many intimatepriya-narm\u0101s,Subala and Ujjvala are considered to be the most prominent.",
            "Subala\u2019s body is described as follows. His complexion is just like molten gold. He is very, very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He always has a garland around his neck, and he wears yellow clothing. His eyes are just like lotus flower petals, and he is so intelligent that by his talking and his moral instructions all the other friends take the highest pleasure. Let us all offer our respectful obeisances unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend Subala!",
            "The degree of intimacy shared by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Subala can be understood by the fact that the talks between them were so confidential that no one else could understand what they were saying.",
            "The description of Ujjvala, another intimate friend, is given as follows. Ujjvala always wears some garment of orange color, and the movements of his eyes are always very restless. He likes to decorate himself with all kinds of flowers, his bodily hue is almost like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, and on his neck there is always a necklace of pearls. He is always very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Let us all worship Ujjvala, the most intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!",
            "About the confidential service of Ujjvala, this statement is to be found, addressed by R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b to one of Her friends: \u201cMy dear friend, it is impossible for Me to keep My prestige! I wanted to avoid talking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a anymore\u00a0\u2013 but just see! There again is His friend Ujjvala, coming to Me with his canvassing work. His entreaties are so powerful that it is very difficult for agop\u012bto resist her love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though she may be very bashful, devoted to her family duties and most faithful to her husband.\u201d",
            "The following is a statement by Ujjvala showing his jubilant nature: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O killer of Agh\u0101sura, You have extended Your loving affairs so much that You can be compared to the great ocean, which is without limitations. At the same time, the young girls of the world, who are all searching after the perfect lover, have become just like rivers running into this ocean. Under the circumstances, all these rivers of young girls may try to divert their courses to some other place, but at the end they must come unto You.\u201d",
            "Among the groups of different friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some are well known from various scriptures, and some are well known by popular tradition. There are three divisions among K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends: some are eternally in friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some are elevated demigods, and some are perfected devotees. In all of these groups there are some who by nature are fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service and are always engaged in giving counsel; some of them are very fond of joking and naturally cause K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to smile by their words; some of them are by nature very simple, and by their simplicity they please Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; some of them create wonderful situations by their activities, apparently against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; some of them are very talkative, always arguing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and creating a debating atmosphere; and some of them are very gentle and give pleasure to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their sweet words. All of these friends are very intimate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they show expertise in their different activities, their aim always being to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s age, His beauty, His bugle, His flute, His conch shell and His pleasing attitude all provoke love in friendship for Him. His exceptional joking abilities, exhibited sometimes by His pretending to be a royal prince or even the Supreme Personality of Godhead also give impetus to devotees developing love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship.",
            "Learned scholars have divided K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s age into three periods: the age up through five years is calledkaum\u0101ra,the age from the sixth through the tenth year is calledpauga\u1e47\u1e0da,and the age from the eleventh through the fifteenth year is calledkai\u015bora.While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spending His days as a cowherd boy, He is in thekaum\u0101raandpauga\u1e47\u1e0daages. In thekai\u015boraage, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in Gokula, He acted as a cowherd boy, and then, when He was sixteen, He went to Mathur\u0101 to kill Ka\u1e41sa.",
            "Thekaum\u0101raage is just suitable for reciprocating the love of a child with mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. In the Tenth Canto, thirteenth chapter, verse 11 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer and the beneficiary of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies, He still used to eat with His cowherd boyfriends. This is because at that time He accepted the pastimes of an ordinary boy, keeping His flute under His arm and His bugle on the right side in His belt, along with His cane. In His left hand He would hold a lump of rice paste with yogurt, and in His fingers would bep\u012blu,the king of fruits. When He would thus sit among His friends, it would appear that He was the whorl of a lotus flower and that the friends surrounding Him were petals. As they thus enjoyed joking among themselves, the denizens of heaven would become struck with wonder and would only stare at the scene.\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019spauga\u1e47\u1e0daage can be further divided into three periods\u00a0\u2013 namely, the beginning, middle and end. In the beginning of thepauga\u1e47\u1e0daage there is a very nice reddish luster on His lips, His abdomen is very thin, and on His neck are circles like those on a conch shell. Sometimes, some outside visitors would return to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and, upon seeing Him again, would exclaim, \u201cMy dear Mukunda, Your beauty is gradually increasing, just like the leaf on a banyan tree! My dear lotus-eyed one, Your neck is gradually manifesting circles like those of the conch shell. And in the shining moonlight Your teeth and cheeks are competing with thepadmar\u0101gajewels in their beautiful arrangement. I am sure that Your beautiful bodily development is now giving much pleasure to Your friends.\u201d",
            "At this age K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was garlanded with various kinds of flowers. He used to put on a silk dress, colored with various kinds of dye. Such beautiful decorations are considered cosmetics for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would wear this dress when He used to go into the forest to tend the cows. Sometimes He would wrestle there with His different friends, and sometimes they would dance all together in the forest. These are some of the specific activities of thepauga\u1e47\u1e0daage.",
            "The cowherd friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were so happy in His company that they expressed their transcendental feelings within themselves thus: \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are always busy tending the cows that are scattered all over beautiful V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. You have a beautiful garland, a small conch shell, a peacock feather on Your turban, yellow-colored silk cloth, decorations ofkar\u1e47ik\u0101raflowers on Your ears and amallik\u0101flower garland on Your chest. Appearing so beautiful, when You pretend, just like an actor, to be fighting with us, You give us unlimited transcendental bliss.\u201d",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is more grown up, in the middle age ofpauga\u1e47\u1e0da,His nails become finely sharp, and His chubby cheeks become lustrous and round. On the two sides of His waist above His belt there are three distinct lines of folded skin calledtri-val\u012b.",
            "The cowherd boyfriends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a felt very proud of their association with Him. At that time the tip of His nose defeated the beauty of sesame flowers, the luster of His cheeks defeated the glow of pearls, and the two sides of His body were exquisitely beautiful. In this age K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wore a silk dress that glittered like lightning, His head was decorated with a silk turban covered with gold lace, and in His hand He carried a stick about fifty-six inches long.* Seeing this exquisitely beautiful dress of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one devotee addressed his friend in this manner: \u201cMy dear friend, just look at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! See how He is carrying in His hand a stick which is bound up and down with golden rings, how His turban with golden lace is showing such a beautiful luster and how His dress is giving His friends the highest transcendental pleasure!\u201d",
            "*\u00a0The specific pastime in this period took place in the forest known as Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bra-vana. This Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bra-vana, along with eleven othervanas,or forests, is still existing in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana area, and devotees who circumambulate the whole area of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana can know the beauty of these forests even today.",
            "At the end of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019spauga\u1e47\u1e0daage, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hair sometimes hangs down to His hips, and sometimes it becomes scattered. In this age His two shoulders become higher and broader, and His face is always decorated with marks oftilaka.When His beautiful hair scatters over His shoulders, it appears to be a goddess of fortune embracing Him, and this embracing is highly relished by His friends. Subala once addressed Him in this way: \u201cMy dear Ke\u015bava, Your round turban, the lotus flower in Your hand, the vertical marks oftilakaon Your forehead, Yourku\u1e45kuma-flavored musk and all of Your beautiful bodily features are defeating me today, although I am usually stronger than You or any of our friends. Since this is so, I do not know how these features of Your body can fail to defeat the pride of all the young girls of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. When I am so defeated by this beauty, what chance is there for those who are naturally very simple and flexible?\u201d",
            "At this age K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took pleasure in whispering into the ears of His friends, and the subject of His talks was the beauty of thegop\u012bs,who were just tarrying before them. Subala once addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are very cunning. You can understand the thoughts of others; therefore I am whispering within Your ear that all of these fivegop\u012bs,who are most beautiful, have been attracted by Your dress. And I believe that Cupid has entrusted them with the responsibility of conquering You.\u201d In other words, the beauty of thegop\u012bswas capable of conquering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the conqueror of all universes.",
            "The symptoms of thekai\u015boraage have already been described, and it is at this age that devotees generally most appreciate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is worshiped as Ki\u015bora-ki\u015bor\u012b. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not increase His age beyond this form ofkai\u015bora,and it is confirmed in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101that although He is the oldest personality and has innumerable different forms, His original form is always youthful. In the pictures of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra we can see that He is youthful, although at that time He was old enough to have sons, grandsons and great-grandsons. The cowherd boyfriends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once said, \u201cDear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You need not decorate Your body with so many ornaments. Your transcendental features are themselves so beautiful that You do not require any ornamentation.\u201d At this age, whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a begins to vibrate His flute early in the morning, all of His friends immediately get up from bed just to join Him in going to the pasturing grounds. One of the friends once said, \u201cMy dear cowherd friends, the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute from above Govardhana Hill is telling us that we need not go to search Him out on the bank of the Yamun\u0101.\u201d",
            "P\u0101rvat\u012b, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, told her husband, \u201cMy dear Pa\u00f1camukha [five-faced], just look at the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas! After hearing the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s conch shell, known as P\u0101\u00f1cajanya, they have regained their strength and are just like lions.\u201d",
            "At this age, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once dressed Himself up exactly like R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b just to create fun among His friends. He put on golden earrings, and because He was blackish, He smeared the pulp ofku\u1e45kumaall over His body in order to become as fair as She. By seeing this dress, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend Subala became very astonished.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a played with His intimate friends sometimes by fighting or wrestling with their arms, sometimes by playing ball and sometimes by playing chess. Sometimes they carried one another on their shoulders, and sometimes they exhibited their expertness at whirling logs. And the cowherd friends used to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by sitting together with Him on couches or on swings, by lying together on their beds, by joking together and by swimming in the pool. All these activities are calledanubh\u0101va.Whenever all the friends would assemble in the company of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they would immediately engage in all these functions, especially in dancing together. Regarding their wrestling, one friend once asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear friend, O killer of the Agha demon, You are very proudly wandering among Your friends trying to exhibit Your arms as very strong. Is it that You are envious of me? I know that You cannot defeat me in wrestling, and I also know that You were sitting idly for a long time because You were hopeless of defeating me.\u201d",
            "All the friends were very daring and would risk any difficulty, because they were confident that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would help them to be victorious in all adventures. They used to sit together and advise one another what to do, sometimes inducing one another to be engaged in welfare work. Sometimes they would offer betel nuts to one another, decorate one another\u2019s faces withtilakaor smear pulp ofcandanaon one another\u2019s bodies. Sometimes, for the sake of amusement, they used to decorate their faces in strange ways. Another business of the friends was that each of them wanted to defeat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes they used to snatch His clothing or snatch away the flowers from His hands. Sometimes one would try to induce another to decorate his body for him, and failing this, they were always ready to fight, challenging one another to combat in wrestling. These were some of the general activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His friends.",
            "Another important pastime of the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was that they served as messengers to and from thegop\u012bs;they introduced thegop\u012bsto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and canvassed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When thegop\u012bswere in disagreement with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, these friends would support K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s side in His presence\u00a0\u2013 but when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not present, they would support the side of thegop\u012bs.In this way, sometimes supporting one side, sometimes the other, they would talk very privately, with much whispering in the ears, although none of the business was very serious.",
            "The servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were sometimes engaged in collecting flowers, decorating His body with valuable ornaments and trinkets, dancing before Him, singing, helping Him herd the cows, massaging His body, preparing flower garlands and sometimes fanning His body. These were some of the primary duties of the servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The friends and servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were combined together in serving Him, and all of their activities are known asanubh\u0101va.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came out from the Yamun\u0101 after chastising the K\u0101liya-n\u0101ga, \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 wanted to embrace Him first, but he could not raise his arms because of his great feeling of respect.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used to play on His flute, the vibration appeared just like the roaring of clouds in the sky during the constellation of Sv\u0101t\u012b. According to Vedic astronomical calculation, if there is rain during the constellation of the Sv\u0101t\u012b star, any rain falling on the sea will produce pearls, and rain falling on a serpent will produce jewels. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute roared like a thundercloud under the Sv\u0101t\u012b constellation, the resulting perspiration on \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101\u2019s body appeared to be just like pearls.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Subala were embracing one another, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b became a little envious, and hiding Her hot temperament She said, \u201cMy dear Subala, you are very fortunate because even in the presence of superiors you and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no hesitation in putting your arms on each other\u2019s shoulders. I think it must be admitted that in your previous lives you have succeeded in many kinds of austerities.\u201d The idea is that although R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was accustomed to putting Her arms on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shoulders, it was not possible for Her to do such a thing in the presence of Her superiors, whereas Subala could do so freely. R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b therefore praised his good fortune.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered the lake of K\u0101liya, His intimate friends became so perturbed that their bodily colors faded and they all produced horrible gurgling sounds. At that time all of them fell down on the ground as if unconscious. Similarly, when there was a forest fire, all of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends neglected their own protection and surrounded K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on all sides to protect Him from the flames. This behavior of the friends toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described by thoughtful poets asvyabhic\u0101r\u012b.Invyabhic\u0101r\u012becstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is sometimes madness, dexterity, fear, laziness, jubilation, pride, dizziness, meditation, disease, forgetfulness and humbleness. These are some of the common symptoms in the stage ofvyabhic\u0101r\u012becstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When there are dealings between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His friends that are completely devoid of any feelings of respect and they all treat one another on an equal level, such ecstatic love in friendship is calledsth\u0101y\u012b.When one is situated in this confidential friendly relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one shows symptoms of love such as attraction, affection, affinity and attachment. An example ofsth\u0101y\u012bwas exhibited when Arjuna told Akr\u016bra, \u201cMy dear son of G\u0101ndin\u012b, please ask K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when I shall be able to embrace Him in my arms.\u201d",
            "When there is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s superiority and yet in dealings with Him on friendly terms respectfulness is completely absent, that stage is called affection. There is one brilliant example of this affection. When the demigods, headed by Lord \u015aiva, were offering respectful prayers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, describing the glorious opulences of the Lord, Arjuna* stood before Him with his hand on His shoulders and brushed the dust from His peacock feather.",
            "*\u00a0This Arjuna, living in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is different from the friend of the same name to whomBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was spoken.",
            "When the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were banished by Duryodhana and forced to live incognito in the forest, no one could trace out where they were staying. At that time, the great sage N\u0101rada met Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and said, \u201cMy dear Mukunda, although You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the all-powerful person, by making friendship with You the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas have become bereft of their legitimate right to the kingdom of the world\u00a0\u2013 and, moreover, they are now living in the forest incognito. Sometimes they must work as ordinary laborers in someone else\u2019s house. These symptoms appear to be very inauspicious materially, but the beauty is that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas have not lost their faith and love for You in spite of all these tribulations. In fact, they are always thinking of You and chanting Your name in ecstatic friendship.\u201d",
            "Another example of acute affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is given in the Tenth Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 18 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.In the pasturing ground K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a felt a little tired and wanted to take rest, so He lay down on the ground. At that time, many cowherd boys assembled there and with great affection began to sing suitable songs so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would rest very nicely.",
            "There is a nice example of the friendship between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. When the fighting was going on, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, the son of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, unceremoniously attacked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although according to the prevailing rules of chivalry one\u2019s chariot driver should never be attacked by the enemy. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 behaved heinously in so many ways that he did not hesitate to attack K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was acting only as charioteer for Arjuna. When Arjuna saw that A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was releasing various kinds of arrows to hurt K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he immediately stood in front of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to intercept all of them. At that time, although Arjuna was being harmed by those arrows, he felt an ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the arrows appeared to him like showers of flowers.",
            "There is another instance of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship. Once when a cowherd boy named V\u1e5b\u1e63abha was collecting flowers from the forest to prepare a garland to be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the sun reached its zenith, and although the sunshine was scorching hot, V\u1e5b\u1e63abha felt it to be like the moonshine. That is the way of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord; when devotees are put into great difficulties\u00a0\u2013 even like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, as described above\u00a0\u2013 they feel all their miserable conditions to be great facilities for serving the Lord.",
            "Another instance of Arjuna\u2019s friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was described by N\u0101rada, who reminded K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cWhen Arjuna was learning the art of shooting arrows, he could not see You for so many days. But when You arrived there he stopped all His activities and immediately embraced You.\u201d This means that even though Arjuna was engaged in learning about the military art, he had not forgotten K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for a moment, and as soon as there was an opportunity to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna immediately embraced Him.",
            "One servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a named Patr\u012b once addressed Him like this: \u201cMy dear Lord, You protected the cowherd boys from the hunger of the Agh\u0101sura demon, and You protected them from the poisonous effects of the K\u0101liya snake. And You also saved them from the fierce forest fire. But I am suffering from Your separation, which is more severe than the hunger of Agh\u0101sura, the poison of Lake K\u0101liya and the burning of the forest fire. So why should You not protect me from the pangs of separation?\u201d Another friend once told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, since You have left us, the heat of separation has become extraordinary. And this heat is felt more severely when we understand that in Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bra-vana You are being refreshed by the waves of the cooling river known as Bh\u0101nu-tanay\u0101 [R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b].\u201d The purport is that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was engaged with R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, the cowherd boys headed by Subala were feeling great separation, and that was unbearable for them.",
            "Another friend addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O killer of Agh\u0101sura, when You left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to kill King Ka\u1e41sa in Mathur\u0101, all the cowherd boys became bereft of their fourbh\u016btas[the elements earth, water, fire and space]. And the fifthbh\u016bta,the air, was flowing very rapidly within their nostrils.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Mathur\u0101 to kill King Ka\u1e41sa, all the cowherd boys became so afflicted by the separation that they almost died. When a person is dead it is said that he has given up the five elements, known asbh\u016btas,as the body again mixes with the five elements from which it was prepared. In this case, although the four elements earth, water, fire and ether were already gone, the remaining element, air, was still very prominent and was blowing through their nostrils furiously. In other words, after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the cowherd boys were always anxious about what would happen in His fight with King Ka\u1e41sa.",
            "Another friend once informed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cWhen one of Your friends was feeling much separation from You, there were tears covering his lotus eyes, and so the black drones of sleep became discouraged from entering his eyes and left that place.\u201d When there is a lotus flower, the black drones fly into it to collect honey. The eyes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend are compared to the lotus flower, and because they were full of tears the black drones of sleep could not collect honey from his lotus eyes and therefore left the place. In other words, because he was too much afflicted, his eyes were full of tears and he could not sleep. This is an example of staying up at night because of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "An example of helplessness is described in the following statement: \u201cDue to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s departure from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to Mathur\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dearest cowherd boys felt as mentally light as possible. They were like fragments of cotton, lighter than the air, and were all floating in the air without any shelter.\u201d In other words, the minds of the cowherd boys became almost vacant on account of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s separation. An example of impatience was also shown by the cowherd boys when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Mathur\u0101. Out of the sorrow of separation, all these boys forgot to take care of their cowherding and tried to forget all the melodious songs they used to sing in the pasturing ground. At last they had no desire to live anymore, being separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "An example of stillness was described by a friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s who informed Him in Mathur\u0101 that all the cowherd boys had become just like leafless trees on the tops of hills. They appeared almost naked, being skinny and frail, and did not carry any fruits or flowers. He informed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that all the cowherd boys residing in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were as still as the trees at the tops of hills. Sometimes they felt diseased from their separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and being so greatly disappointed, they were aimlessly wandering on the banks of the Yamun\u0101.",
            "There is also an example of madness caused by separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, all the cowherd boys became bewildered, and having given up all kinds of activities, they appeared to be mad and forgot all their regular business. They were sometimes lying down on the ground, sometimes rolling in the dust, sometimes laughing and sometimes running very swiftly. All of these symptoms gave them the appearance of madmen. One friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s criticized Him by saying, \u201cMy dear Lord, You have become the king of Mathur\u0101 after killing Ka\u1e41sa, and that is very good news for us. But in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana all the residents have become blind from their continuous crying over Your absence. They are full only of anxieties and are not cheered at all by Your becoming the king of Mathur\u0101.\u201d",
            "Sometimes there were also signs of death caused by separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Once K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was told, \u201cMy dear enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, because of their separation from You, the cowherd boys are suffering too much and they are now lying down in the valleys, breathing only slightly. In order to sympathize with the boys\u2019 regrettable condition, even the forest friends, the deer, are shedding tears.\u201d",
            "In theMathur\u0101-kha\u1e47\u1e0dachapter of theSkanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a,there is a description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma surrounded by all the cowherd boys, always engaged in taking care of the cows and calves. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was met by Arjuna at a potter\u2019s shop in the city of Drupada-nagara, because of the similarity of their bodily features they made intimate friendship. This is an instance of friendship caused by the attraction of similar bodies.",
            "In the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,seventy-first chapter, verse 27, it is stated that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arrived in the city of Indraprastha, Bh\u012bma was so overwhelmed with joy that with tears in his eyes and a smiling face he immediately embraced his maternal cousin. Following him were his young brothers Nakula and Sahadeva, along with Arjuna, and they all became so overwhelmed at seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that with full satisfaction they embraced the Lord, who is known as Acyuta (the infallible). There is a similar statement about the cowherd boys of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, all the cowherd boys came to see Him wearing jeweled earrings in their ears. Becoming so greatly overjoyed, they extended their arms and embraced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their old friend. These are instances of full satisfaction in friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In the Tenth Canto, twelfth chapter, verse 12 of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,it is stated that even after undergoing severe penances and austerities and performing the yogic principles, the great mysticyog\u012bscan hardly become eligible to achieve the dust of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but the same Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is easily available to the vision of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. This means there is no comparison to the great fortune of these devotees. The friendly relationship of the cowherd boys with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a particular type of spiritual ecstasy almost similar to the ecstasy of conjugal love. This ecstasy of loving affairs between the cowherd boys and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very difficult to explain. Great expert devotees like R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b express their astonishment at the inconceivable feelings which are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His cowherd boyfriends.",
            "This particular type of ecstatic love shared between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His confidential friends further develops into parental love, and on from there it may develop into conjugal love, the most exalted humor, or mellow, of ecstatic love between Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees."

            "When ecstatic love develops into the relationship of parenthood and becomes steadily established, the relationship is calledv\u0101tsalya-rasa.The exhibition of thisv\u0101tsalya-rasastandard of devotional service can be found in the dealings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with His devotees who represent themselves as superior personalities like father, mother and teacher.",
            "Learned scholars have described the impetuses for parental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, existing in the elderly personalities who are in relation with Him, as follows: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose bodily complexion is just like a bluish, new-grown lotus flower, whose body is very delicate and whose lotus eyes are surrounded by scattered hair as black as bees, was walking on the streets of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana when mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, the beloved wife of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, saw Him. Immediately the milk began to flow from her breasts, soaking her body.\u201d Some specific provocations for parental love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are listed as His blackish bodily hue, which is very attractive and pleasing to see, His all-auspicious bodily features, His mildness, His sweet words, His simplicity, His shyness, His humility, His constant readiness to offer respect to the elderly and His charity. All of these qualities are considered ecstatic provocations for parental love.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, eighth chapter, verse 45, it is stated by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 accepted Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as her son, although He is accepted in theVedasas the king of heaven, in theUpani\u1e63adsas the impersonal Brahman, in philosophy as the supreme male, by theyog\u012bsas the Supersoul and by the devotees as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Once mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 addressed one of her friends in this way: \u201cNanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the leader of the cowherd men, worshiped Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, along with me, and as a result of this worship, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has been saved from the clutches of P\u016btan\u0101 and other demons. The twinarjunatrees were, of course, broken due to a strong wind, and although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared to have lifted Govardhana Hill along with Balar\u0101ma, I think that Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja actually held the mountain. Otherwise how could it have been possible for a little boy to lift such a great hill?\u201d This is another example of ecstasy in parental love. This kind of parental love is generated in a devotee out of his conviction, in love, that he himself is superior to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that without being taken care of by such a devotee, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could not possibly live. One devotee therefore prayed to the parents of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cLet me take shelter of the elderly parental devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are always anxious to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to maintain Him, and they are always so kind to Him. Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto them for being so kind to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the parent of the whole universe!\u201d",
            "There is a similar prayer by abr\u0101hma\u1e47awho says, \u201cLet others worship theVedasand theUpani\u1e63ads,and let others worship theMah\u0101bh\u0101rataif they are afraid of material existence and want to become liberated from that condition. But as far as I am concerned, I wish only to worship Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, because the supreme absolute Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is crawling in his courtyard as his own child.\u201d",
            "Following is a list of respectable personalities who enjoy parental affection toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: (1) mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, the Queen of Vraja, (2) Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, the King of Vraja, (3) mother Rohi\u1e47\u012b, the mother of Balar\u0101ma, (4) all the elderlygop\u012bswhose sons were taken away by Lord Brahm\u0101, (5) Devak\u012b, the wife of Vasudeva, (6) the other fifteen wives of Vasudeva, (7) Kunt\u012b, the mother of Arjuna, (8) Vasudeva, the real father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and (9) S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s teacher. All these are considered respectable elderly personalities with parental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This list is in order of superior importance, and thus we can see that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda are considered to be the supermost of all elderly personalities.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, ninth chapter, verse 3, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it a description of the form and beauty of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. He says, \u201cMy dear King, the wide hips of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 were surrounded by silk and linen clothes, and her breasts were flowing with milk because of her affection. When she was churning butter and tightly holding the rope, the bangles on her hands and the earrings on her ears were moving, and from the nice decoration in her hair the flowers were slackening and falling down. Due to her excessive labor, there were drops of perspiration on her face.\u201d",
            "There is another description of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in a devotee\u2019s prayer: \u201cLet me be given protection by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, whose curly hairs are bound with thread, whose hair is very brightly beautified by the vermillion placed in the part and whose bodily frame derides all her ornaments. Her eyes are always engaged in seeing the face of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus they are always filled with tears. Her complexion, which resembles the bluish lotus flower, is enhanced in beauty by her dressing herself with many colorful garments. Let her merciful glance fall on all of us so that we may be protected from the clutches ofm\u0101y\u0101and smoothly progress in our devotional service!\u201d",
            "There is the following description of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. After rising early in the morning, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 first of all offered her breast milk to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then she began to chant variousmantrasfor His protection. Then she would decorate His forehead very nicely and bind His arms with protective talismans. By all of these activities, it is definitely understood that she is the emblem of all maternal affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The description of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s bodily features is as follows: The hairs on his head are generally black, but some of them are gray. His garments are of greenish color, like the new-grown leaves of a banyan tree. His belly is fatty, his complexion is exactly like the full moon, and he has a beautiful mustache. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a baby, one day He was walking in the courtyard, capturing the finger of His father, and because He could not walk steadily He appeared to be almost falling down. While Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was giving protection to His transcendental son in this way, all of a sudden there were drops of tears in his eyes and he became overwhelmed with joy. Let us all offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of King Nanda!",
            "Childhood age, childish dress, movements by the child, sweet words spoken by the child, nice smiling and various forms of childish play are considered provocations for increasing parental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The childhood ages of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are divided into three periods: the beginning ofkaum\u0101raage, the middle ofkaum\u0101raage and the end ofkaum\u0101raage. During the beginning and middle of thekaum\u0101raage, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s thighs are fatty, and the inner part of His eyes are whitish. There are signs of teeth coming out, and He is very mild and gentle. He is described as follows: \u201cWhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had only three or four teeth coming out of His gums, His thighs were fatty, His body was very, very short, and He began to enhance the parental love of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 with the activities of His childish body. He was sometimes stepping with His legs again and again, sometimes crying, sometimes smiling, sometimes sucking His thumb and sometimes lying down flat. These are some of the different activities of the child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was lying down flat, sometimes sucking the toes of His feet, sometimes throwing His legs upward, sometimes crying and sometimes smiling, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, seeing her son in such pastimes, did not show any sign of restricting Him, but rather began to watch her child with eagerness, enjoying these childhood pastimes.\u201d In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019skaum\u0101raage, the nails of tigers were set in a golden necklace about His neck. There was protectivetilakaon His forehead, black mascara around His eyes and silk thread around His waist. These are the descriptions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dress at the beginning of thekaum\u0101raage.",
            "When Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw the beauty of child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with tiger nails on His chest, a complexion like the new-growntam\u0101latree, beautifully decoratedtilakamade with cow\u2019s urine, arm decorations of nice silk thread, and silk clothes tied around His waist\u00a0\u2013 when Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw his child like this, he never became satiated by the child\u2019s beauty.",
            "In the middlekaum\u0101raage, the upper portion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hair falls around His eyes. Sometimes He is covered with cloth around the lower part of His body, and sometimes He is completely naked. Sometimes He tries to walk, taking step by step, and sometimes He talks very sweetly, in broken language. These are some of the symptoms of His middlekaum\u0101raage. He is thus described when mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 once saw Him in His middlekaum\u0101raage: His scattered hairs were touching His eyebrows, and His eyes were restless, but He could not express His feelings with proper words; still, when He was talking, His talk was so nice and sweet to hear. When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 looked at His little ears and saw Him naked, trying to run very quickly with His little legs, she was merged into the ocean of nectar. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s ornaments at this age are a pearl hanging from the septum of His nose, butter on His lotuslike palms, and some small bells hanging from His waist. It is stated that when mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 saw that the child was moving, ringing the bells on His waist, smiling at her with a pearl between His nostrils and with butter on His hands, she became wonderfully pleased to see her little child in that fashion.",
            "While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in the middle of Hiskaum\u0101raage, His waist became thinner, His chest became broader, and His head was decorated with His curly hairs, resembling the falling of the wings of a crow. These wonderful features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body never failed to astonish mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. At the end of Hiskaum\u0101raage, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a carried a small stick in His hand, His clothing was a little longer, and He had a knot around His waist, resembling the hood of a snake. In that dress He used to take care of the calves near the house, and sometimes He played with cowherd boys of about the same age. He had a slender flute and a buffalo-horn bugle, and sometimes He played on a flute made from the leaves of trees. These are some of the symptoms of the end of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019skaum\u0101raage.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a little grown up and was taking care of the small calves, He would often go near the forest. And when He was a little bit late returning home, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would immediately get up on thecandra-\u015b\u0101lik\u0101(a small shed built on the roof for getting a bird\u2019s-eye view all around), and he would watch for Him. Worrying about the late arrival of his little son, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would remain on thecandra-\u015b\u0101lik\u0101until he could indicate to his wife that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, surrounded by His little cowherd friends, was coming back with the calves. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would point out the peacock feather on his child\u2019s head and would inform his beloved wife how the child was pleasing his eyes.",
            "Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 would then address Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cSee my dear son, whose eyes are white, who has a turban on His head, a wrapper on His body and leg bells that tinkle very sweetly on His feet. He is coming near, along with Hissurabhicalves, and just see how He is wandering upon the sacred land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana!\u201d",
            "Similarly, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda would address his wife, \u201cMy dear Ya\u015bod\u0101, just look at your offspring, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! See His blackish bodily luster, His eyes tinged with red color, His broad chest and His nice golden necklace! How wonderful He looks, and how He is increasing my transcendental bliss more and more!\u201d",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the beloved son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, steps into Hiskai\u015boraage, although He becomes more beautiful, His parents still consider Him to be in thepauga\u1e47\u1e0daage\u00a0\u2013 even though He is between the ages of ten and fifteen. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is in Hispauga\u1e47\u1e0daage, some of His servants also accept Him as being in thekai\u015boraage. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performs His childish pastimes, His general practice is to break the milk and yogurt pots, throw the yogurt in the courtyard and steal the cream from the milk. Sometimes He breaks the churning rod and sometimes He throws butter on the fire. In this way, He increases the transcendental pleasure of His mother, Ya\u015bod\u0101.",
            "In this connection mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 once told Mukhar\u0101, her maidservant, \u201cJust look at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a looking stealthily toward all sides and slowly stepping forward from the bushes. It appears that He is coming just to steal the butter. Don\u2019t expose yourself or He may understand that we are looking toward Him. I want to enjoy the sight of His eyebrows moving in this cunning way, and I want to see His fearful eyes and beautiful face.\u201d",
            "In enjoying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attitude of stealing butter very stealthily, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 experienced the ecstasy of maternal love by smelling His head, sometimes patting His body with her hand, sometimes offering blessings, sometimes ordering Him, sometimes gazing at Him, sometimes maintaining Him and sometimes giving Him good instructions not to become a thief. Such activities are in maternal ecstatic love. An important point to be observed in this connection is that the childish propensity of stealing is there even in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore this propensity is not artificial. However, in the spiritual relationship there is no inebriety to this stealing propensity, as there is in the material world.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, thirteenth chapter, verse 33, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cMy dear King, as soon as the elderlygop\u012bssaw their sons coming, there was an inexpressible sign of parental love, and all of them became absorbed in affection. At first they were planning to chastise their sons for stealing butter, but as soon as the sons came before their eyes, they lost all of their angry attitudes and became overwhelmed with affection. They began to embrace their sons and smell their heads. While doing this, they became almost mad after their children.\u201d In their childhood pastimes, all these cowherd boys joined with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in stealing butter. But rather than become angry, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 became wet from the milk flowing out of her breasts. Out of her affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, she began to smell His head repeatedly.",
            "The general activities of all the mothers of the cowherd boys were to kiss them, to embrace them, to call them by their names and sometimes to chastise them mildly for their stealing habits. These manifestations of parental love are calleds\u0101ttvikaecstasy, wherein manifestations of eight kinds of ecstatic symptoms are visible in full. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, thirteenth chapter, verse 22, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cAll the mothers of the cowherd boys were illusioned by the covering influence of theyoga-m\u0101y\u0101potency of the Personality of Godhead, and as soon as they heard the flute playing of their boys, they immediately stood up and mentally embraced their sons, who had been created by the direct internal potency of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Accepting them as their born sons, they lifted them into their arms and began to embrace them, resting the children\u2019s bodies upon their own. The emotions created by this incident were sweeter than nectar turned into a palatable intoxicant, and the milk flowing out of their breasts was immediately drunk up by the children.\u201d",
            "In theLalita-m\u0101dhava,compiled by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as follows: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when You are engaged in herding the animals, the dust caused by the hooves of the calves and cows covers Your nice face and artistictilaka,and You appear very dusty. But when You return home, the milk flowing out of the breasts of Your mother washes Your face of its dust covering and You appear to be purified by this milk, just as when the Deity is washed during the performance of theabhi\u1e63ekaceremony.\u201d It is the custom in the temples of Deities that if there have been some impure activities, the Deity has to be washed with milk. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He was washed by the milk from the breast of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, which purified Him from the dust covering.",
            "Sometimes there are examples of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s becoming stunned in ecstasy. This was exhibited when she saw her son lifting Govardhana Hill. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was standing, raising the hill, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 hesitated to embrace Him and became stunned. The dangerous position that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had accepted by lifting the hill brought tears to her eyes. With her eyes filled with tears she could not see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a anymore, and because her throat was choked up by anxiety she could not even instruct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to what He should do in that position. This is a symptom of becoming stunned in ecstatic love.",
            "Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 sometimes enjoyed transcendental ecstasy in happiness when her child was saved from a dangerous situation, such as being attacked by P\u016btan\u0101 or some other demon. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, seventeenth chapter, verse 19, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 felt very, very fortunate when she got back her lost child. She immediately placed Him on her lap and began to embrace Him again and again. While she was thus embracing her son repeatedly, torrents of tears fell from her eyes, and she was unable to express her transcendental joy. It is stated in theVidagdha-m\u0101dhavaof \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the touch of Your mother is so pleasing and cooling that it surpasses the cooling capacity of the pulp of sandalwood and of bright moonshine mixed with the pulp ofu\u015b\u012braroot.\u201d (U\u015b\u012brais a kind of root which when soaked with water has a very, very cooling effect. It is especially used in the scorching heat of the sun.)",
            "The parental love of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a steadily increases, and her love and ecstasy are sometimes described as intense affection and sometimes as overwhelming attachment. An example of attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with overwhelming affection is given in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, sixth chapter, verse 43, where \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b addresses Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it in this way: \u201cMy dear King, when magnanimous Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja returned from Mathur\u0101, he began to smell the head of his son, and he was merged in the ecstasy of parental love.\u201d A similar statement is there in connection with mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 when she was too anxious to hear the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, expecting Him back from the pasturing ground. Because she thought that it was getting very late, her anxiety to hear the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute became doubled, and milk began to flow from her breast. In that condition she was sometimes going within the house, sometimes coming out of the house. She was constantly looking to see if Govinda was coming back along the road. When many very great sages were offering prayers to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, glorifying His activities, the Queen of Gokula, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, entered the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, wetting the lower part of hers\u0101r\u012bwith the milk flowing from her breast. This entrance of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 at Kuruk\u1e63etra was not during the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. At other times K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Kuruk\u1e63etra from His paternal home (Dv\u0101rak\u0101) during the solar eclipse, and at these times the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana also went to see Him there.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arrived at Kuruk\u1e63etra on pilgrimage, all the people assembled there began to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Devak\u012b, had arrived. At that time, Devak\u012b, just like an affectionate mother, began to pat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s face. And again when people cried that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Vasudeva, had come, both King Nanda and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 became overwhelmed with affection and expressed their great pleasure.",
            "When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, the Queen of Gokula, was going to see her son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at Kuruk\u1e63etra, one of her friends addressed her thus: \u201cMy dear Queen, the milk flowing out of your breast-mountain has already whitened the river Ganges, and the tears from your eyes, mixed with black mascara, have already blackened the color of the Yamun\u0101. And as you are standing just between the two rivers, I think that there is no need for your anxiety to see your son\u2019s face. Your parental affection has already been exhibited to Him by these two rivers!\u201d",
            "The same friend of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cMy dear Mukunda, if mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, the Queen of Gokula, is forced to stand on fire but is allowed to see Your lotus face, then this fire will appear to her like the Himalaya Mountains: full of ice. In the same way, if she is allowed to stay in the ocean of nectar but is not allowed to see the lotus face of Your Grace, then even this ocean of nectar will appear to her like an ocean of arsenic poison.\u201d Let the anxiety of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 of Vraja, always expecting to see the lotus face of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, be glorified all over the universe!",
            "A similar statement was given by Kunt\u012bdev\u012b to Akr\u016bra: \u201cMy dear brother Akr\u016bra, my nephew Mukunda is long absent from us. Will you kindly tell Him that His aunt Kunt\u012b is sitting among the enemy and would like to know when she will be able to see His lotus face again?\u201d",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, forty-sixth chapter, verse 28, there is this statement: \u201cWhen Uddhava was present at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and was narrating the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, while hearing this narration, began to pour milk from her breasts and shed tears from her eyes.\u201d Another incident demonstrating Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s extreme love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a occurred when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Mathur\u0101, the kingdom of Ka\u1e41sa. In separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was looking at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s makeup utensils, and she fell down on the ground almost unconscious, with a great sound. When she was rolling over on the ground, there were many scratches on her body, and in that piteous condition she began to cry, \u201cO my dear son! My dear son!\u201d And she slapped her breasts with her two hands. This activity of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 is explained by expert devotees as ecstatic love in separation. Sometimes there are many other symptoms, such as great anxiety, lamentation, frustration, being stunned, humility, restlessness, madness and illusion.",
            "As far as mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s anxieties are concerned, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was out of the house in the pasturing ground, a devotee once told her, \u201cYa\u015bod\u0101, I think your movements have been slackened, and I see that you are full of anxieties. Your two eyes appear to be without any movement, and I feel in your breathing a kind of warmth, which is bringing your breast milk to the boiling point. All these conditions prove that out of separation from your son you have a severe headache.\u201d These are some of the symptoms of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s anxiety for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When Akr\u016bra was present in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and was narrating the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was informed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had married so many queens and was very busy there in His householder affairs. Hearing this, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 lamented how unfortunate she was that she could not get her son married just after He passed Hiskai\u015boraage and that she therefore could not receive both her son and daughter-in-law at her home. She exclaimed, \u201cMy dear Akr\u016bra, you are simply throwing thunderbolts on my head!\u201d These are signs of lamentation on the part of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Similarly, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 felt frustration when she thought, \u201cAlthough I have millions of cows, the milk of these cows could not satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore let a curse be on this milk! And I also am condemned, because although I am so opulent in material prosperity, I am now unable to smell the head of my child and feed Him with my breast milk as I used to do when He was here in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d This is a sign of frustration on the part of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s addressed Him thus: \u201cMy dear lotus-eyed one, when You were living in Gokula You were always bearing a stick in Your hand. That stick is now lying idle in the house of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and whenever she sees it she becomes motionless just like the stick.\u201d This is a sign of becoming stunned in separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 became so humble that she prayed to the creator of the universe, Lord Brahm\u0101, with tears in her eyes, \u201cMy dear creator, won\u2019t you kindly bring my dear son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a back to me so that I can see Him at least for a moment?\u201d Sometimes, in restlessness like a madwoman, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 used to accuse Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cWhat are you doing in the palace? You shameless man! Why do people call you the King of Vraja? It is very astonishing that while being separated from your dear son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you are still living within V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as a hardhearted father!\u201d",
            "Someone informed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the madness of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in the following words: \u201cIn madness mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 has addressed thekadambatrees and inquired from them, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019 Similarly, she has addressed the birds and the drones and inquired from them whether K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has passed before them, and she has inquired if they can say anything about You. In this way, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in illusion was asking everybody about You, and she has been wandering all over V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d This is madness in separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was accused by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 of being \u201chardhearted,\u201d he replied, \u201cMy dear Ya\u015bod\u0101, why are you becoming so agitated? Kindly look more carefully. Just see, your son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is standing before you! Don\u2019t become a madwoman like this. Please keep my home peaceful.\u201d And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was informed by some friend that His father Nanda was also in illusion in this way, in separation from Him.",
            "When all the wives of Vasudeva were present in the arena of Ka\u1e41sa, they saw the most pleasing bodily features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and immediately, out of parental affection, milk began to flow from their breasts, and the lower parts of theirs\u0101r\u012bsbecame wet. This symptom of ecstatic love is an example of the result of fulfillment of desire.",
            "In the First Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,eleventh chapter, verse 29, it is stated, \u201cWhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered Dv\u0101rak\u0101 after finishing the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He first of all saw His mother and all His different stepmothers and offered His respectful obeisances unto their feet. The mothers immediately took K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a upon their laps, and because of their parental affection, there was milk flowing out of their breasts. So their breast milk, mixed with the water of tears, became the first offering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d This is one of the examples of being satisfied after a great separation.",
            "There is a similar statement in theLalita-m\u0101dhava:\u201cHow wonderful it is that Ya\u015bod\u0101, the wife of King Nanda, out of her parental affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mixed her tears and the milk from her breasts and thus bathed her dear son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d InVidagdha-m\u0101dhava,a devotee addresses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cMy dear Mukunda, just after seeing Your face, which was full with the scent of the lotus flower, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, being attracted by the moonlight of Your face, became so overjoyed in her affection that immediately from the nipples of her water-potlike breasts, milk began to flow.\u201d She was thus constantly engaged in supplying milk to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after wetting the covering cloth over the jug.",
            "These are some of the signs of parental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His mother, His father and elderly persons. Symptoms of ecstatic love in parental affection are expressed when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted as the son. These constant transcendental emotions for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called steady ecstasy in parental love.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states herein that according to some learned scholars, the three kinds of transcendental mellow so far described\u00a0\u2013 namely, servitude, fraternity and parental affection\u00a0\u2013 are sometimes mixed. For example, the fraternal feelings of Balar\u0101ma are mixed with servitude and parental affection. Similarly, King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mixed with parental affection and servitude. Similarly, the transcendental mellow of Ugrasena, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grandfather, is mixed with servitude and parental affection. The affection of all the elderlygop\u012bsin V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is a mixture of parental love, servitude and fraternity. The affection of the sons of M\u0101dr\u012b\u00a0\u2013 Nakula and Sahadeva\u00a0\u2013 as well as the affection of the sage N\u0101rada, is a mixture of friendship and servitude. The affection of Lord \u015aiva, Garu\u1e0da and Uddhava is a mixture of servitude and fraternity."

            "Devotional Service In Conjugal Love",
            "A pure devotee\u2019s attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in conjugal love is called devotional service in conjugal love. Although such conjugal feelings are not at all material, there is some similarity between this spiritual love and material activities. Therefore, persons who are interested only in material activities are unable to understand this spiritual conjugal love, and these devotional reciprocations appear very mysterious to them. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore describes conjugal love very briefly.",
            "The impetuses of conjugal love are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His very dear consorts, such as R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and Her immediate associates. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no rival; no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him. His beauty is also without any rival, and because He excels all others in the pastimes of conjugal love, He is the original object of all conjugal love.",
            "In theG\u012bta-govinda,by Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, onegop\u012btells her friend, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all pleasure within this universe. His body is as soft as the lotus flower. And His free behavior with thegop\u012bs,which appears exactly like a young boy\u2019s attraction to a young girl, is a subject matter of transcendental conjugal love.\u201d A pure devotee follows in the footsteps of thegop\u012bsand worships thegop\u012bsas follows: \u201cLet me offer my respectful obeisances to all the young cowherd girls, whose bodily features are so attractive. Simply by their beautiful attractive features they are worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Out of all the younggop\u012bs,\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is the most prominent.",
            "The beauty of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is described as follows: \u201cHer eyes defeat the attractive features of the eyes of thecakor\u012bbird. When one sees the face of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, he immediately hates the beauty of the moon. Her bodily complexion defeats the beauty of gold. Thus, let us all look upon the transcendental beauty of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attraction for R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is described by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself thus: \u201cWhen I create some joking phrases in order to enjoy the beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b hears these joking words with great attention; but by Her bodily features and counterwords She neglects Me. And I even possess unlimited pleasure by Her neglect of Me, for She becomes so beautiful that She increases My pleasure one hundred times.\u201d A similar statement can be found inG\u012bta-govinda,wherein it is said that when the enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, embraces \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, He immediately becomes entangled in a loving condition and gives up the company of all othergop\u012bs.",
            "In thePady\u0101val\u012bof R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b it is stated that when thegop\u012bshear the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, they immediately forget all rebukes offered by the elderly members of their families. They forget their defamation and the harsh behavior of their husbands. Their only thought is to go out in search of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When thegop\u012bsmeet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the display of their exchanging glances as well as their joking and laughing behavior is calledanubh\u0101va,or subecstasy in conjugal love.",
            "In theLalita-m\u0101dhava,R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that the movements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eyebrows are just like the Yamun\u0101 and that the smiling of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is just like the moonshine. When the Yamun\u0101 and the moonshine come in contact on the bank of the river, the water tastes just like nectar, and drinking it gives great satisfaction. It is as cooling as piles of snow. Similarly, in thePady\u0101val\u012b,one constant companion of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b says, \u201cMy dear moon-faced R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Your whole body appears very content, yet there are signs of tears in Your eyes. Your speech is faltering, and Your chest is also heaving. By all these signs I can understand that You must have heard the blowing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, and as a result of this, Your heart is now melting.\u201d",
            "In the samePady\u0101val\u012bthere is the following description, which is taken as a sign of frustration in conjugal love. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b said, \u201cDear Mr. Cupid, please do not excite Me by throwing your arrows at My body. Dear Mr. Air, please do not arouse Me with the fragrance of flowers. I am now bereft of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s loving attitude, and so, under the circumstances, what is the use of My sustaining this useless body? There is no need for such a body by any living entity.\u201d This is a sign of frustration in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Similarly, inD\u0101na-keli-kaumud\u012b,\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, pointing to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, says, \u201cThis clever boy of the forest has the beauty of a bluish lotus flower, and He can attract all the young girls of the universe. Now, after giving Me a taste of His transcendental body, He has enthused Me, and it is more than I can tolerate. I am now feeling like a female elephant who has been enthused by a male elephant!\u201d This is an instance of jubilation in ecstatic love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "The steady ecstasy of conjugal love is the original cause of bodily enjoyment. In thePady\u0101val\u012bthis original cause of union is described when R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b tells one of Her constant companions, \u201cMy dear friend, who is this boy whose eyelids, dancing constantly, have increased the beauty of His face and attracted My desire for conjugal love? His ears are decorated with buds ofa\u015bokaflowers, and He has dressed Himself in yellow robes. By the sound of His flute, this boy has already made Me impatient.\u201d",
            "The conjugal love of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never disturbed by any personal consideration. The undisturbed nature of the conjugal love between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described thus: \u201cJust a little distance away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was surrounded by all of His friends. In front of His eyes was Candr\u0101val\u012b, and, at the same time, on a chunk of stone in front of the entrance to Vraja stood the demon known as V\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101sura. But even in such circumstances, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saw R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b standing just behind a bush of many creepers, immediately His beautiful eyebrows moved just like lightning toward Her.\u201d",
            "Another instance is described as follows: \u201cOn one side of the courtyard the dead body of \u015aa\u1e45kh\u0101sura was lying, surrounded by many jackals. On another side were many learnedbr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho were all self-controlled. They were offering nice prayers, which were as soothing as the cool breeze in summer. In front of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord Baladeva was standing, causing a cooling effect. But even amid all these different circumstances of soothing and disturbing effects, the lotus flower of ecstatic conjugal love that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a felt for R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b could not wither.\u201d This love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is often compared to a blooming lotus; the only difference is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s love remains ever-increasingly beautiful.",
            "Conjugal love is divided into two portions:vipralambha,or conjugal love in separation, andsambhoga,or conjugal love in direct contact.Vipralambha,separation, has three subdivisions, known as (1)p\u016brva-r\u0101ga,or preliminary attraction, (2)m\u0101na,or seeming anger, and (3)prav\u0101sa,or separation by distance.",
            "When the lover and the beloved have a distinct feeling of not meeting each other, that stage is calledp\u016brva-r\u0101ga,or preliminary attraction. InPady\u0101val\u012bR\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b told Her companion, \u201cMy dear friend, I was just going to the bank of the Yamun\u0101, and all of a sudden a very nice boy whose complexion is like a dark blue cloud became visible in front of My eyes. He glanced over Me in a way that I cannot describe. But since this has occurred, I am sorry that I can no longer engage My mind in the duties of My household affairs.\u201d This is an instance of preliminary attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, fifty-third chapter, verse 2, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told the messengerbr\u0101hma\u1e47awho came from Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, \u201cMy dearbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,just like Rukmi\u1e47\u012b I cannot sleep at night, and My mind is always fixed on her. I know that her brother Rukm\u012b is against Me and that due to his persuasion My marriage with her has been cancelled.\u201d This is another instance of preliminary attraction.",
            "As far asm\u0101na,or anger, is concerned, there is the following incident described inG\u012bta-govinda:\u201cWhen \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoying Himself in the company of several othergop\u012bs,She became a little jealous because Her special prestige was being dimmed. Therefore, She immediately left the scene and took shelter in a nice flower bush where the black drones were humming. Then, hiding Herself behind the creepers, She began to express Her sorrow to one of Her consorts.\u201d This is an instance of a seeming disagreement.",
            "An example ofprav\u0101sa,or being out of contact because of living in a distant place, is given in thePady\u0101val\u012bas follows: \u201cSince the auspicious day when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left for Mathur\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b has been pressing Her head on one of Her hands and constantly shedding tears. Her face is always wet now, and therefore there is no chance of Her sleeping even for a moment.\u201d When the face becomes wet, the sleeping tendency is immediately removed. So when R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was always weeping for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of His separation, there was no chance of Her getting any sleep for Herself. In thePrahl\u0101da-sa\u1e41hit\u0101Uddhava says, \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, panic-stricken due to being pierced by the arrows of Cupid, is always thinking of you [thegop\u012bs], and He is not even accepting His regular lunch. Nor is He getting any proper rest.\u201d",
            "When the lover and beloved come together and enjoy one another by direct contact, this stage is calledsambhoga.There is a statement inPady\u0101val\u012bas follows: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a embraced \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b in such an expert manner that He appeared to be celebrating the dancing ceremony of the peacocks.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b thus ends the fifth wave of his Ocean of the Nectar of Devotion. He offers his respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Gop\u0101la, the eternal form of the Lord.",
            "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the third division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuin the matter of the five primary relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "Laughing Ecstasy",
            "In the fourth division ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described seven kinds of indirect ecstasies of devotional service, known as laughing, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, anger, dread and ghastliness. In this portion, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b further describes these ecstasies of devotional feelings, some being compatible and others incompatible with one another. When one kind of ecstatic devotional service overlaps with another in a conflicting way, this state of affairs is calledras\u0101bh\u0101sa,or a perverted presentation of mellows.",
            "Expert learned scholars say that laughing is generally found among youngsters or in the combination of old persons and young children. This ecstatic loving laughing is sometimes also found in persons who are very grave by nature. Once an old mendicant approached the door of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s house, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Ya\u015bod\u0101, \u201cMy dear mother, I don\u2019t wish to go near this skinny villain. If I go there, he might put Me within his begging bag and take Me away from you!\u201d In this way, the wonderful child, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, began to look at His mother, while the mendicant, who was standing at the door, tried to hide his smiling face, although he could not do so. He immediately expressed his smiling. In this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the object of laughing affairs.",
            "Once one of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends informed Him, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if You will open Your mouth, then I shall give You one nice sugar candy mixed with yogurt.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately opened His mouth, but instead of giving Him sugar candy with yogurt, the friend dropped a flower in His mouth. After tasting this flower, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a turned His mouth in a disfigured way, and upon seeing this all His friends standing there began to laugh very loudly.",
            "Once a palmist came to the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja asked him, \u201cMy dear sage, will you kindly check the hand of my child, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Tell me how many years He will live and whether He will become the master of thousands of cows.\u201d Upon hearing this, the palmist began to smile, and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja asked him, \u201cMy dear sir, why are you laughing, and why are you covering your face?\u201d",
            "In such a laughing ecstasy of love, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or matters pertaining to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the cause of the laughter. In such laughing devotional service, there are symptoms of jubilation, laziness, concealed feelings and similar other seemingly disturbing elements.",
            "According to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s calculation, laughter in ecstatic love can be broken down into six divisions. These divisions, according to different degrees of smiling, are called in the Sanskrit languagesmita, hasita, vihasita, avahasita, apahasitaandatihasita.These six classes of smiling can be classified as major and minor. The major division includessmita, hasitaandvihasitasmiling, and the minor division includesavahasita, apahasitaandatihasitasmiling.",
            "When one is smiling but his teeth are not visible, one can distinctly mark a definite change in the eyes and in the cheeks. This is calledsmitasmiling. Once when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was stealing yogurt, Jarat\u012b, the headmistress of the house, could detect His activities, and she was therefore coming very hurriedly to catch Him. At that time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became very much afraid of Jarat\u012b and went to His elder brother, Baladeva. He said, \u201cMy dear brother, I have stolen yogurt! Just see\u00a0\u2013 Jarat\u012b is coming hurriedly to catch Me!\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was thus seeking the shelter of Baladeva because He was being chased by Jarat\u012b, all the great sages in the heavenly planets began to smile. This smiling is calledsmitasmiling.",
            "Smiling in which the teeth are slightly visible is calledhasitasmiling. One day Abhimanyu, the so-called husband of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, was returning home, and at that time he could not see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there in his house. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately changed His dress to look exactly like Abhimanyu and approached Abhimanyu\u2019s mother, Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, addressing her thus: \u201cMy dear mother, I am your real son Abhimanyu, but just see\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, dressed up like me, is coming before you!\u201d Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, the mother of Abhimanyu, immediately believed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was her own son and thus became very angry at her real son who was coming home. She began to drive away her real son, who was crying, \u201cMother! Mother! What are you doing?\u201d Seeing this incident, all the girlfriends of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, who were present there, began to smile, and a portion of their teeth was visible. This is an instance ofhasitasmiling.",
            "When the teeth are distinctly visible in a smile, that is calledvihasita.One day when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was engaged in stealing butter and yogurt in the house of Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, He assured His friends, \u201cMy dear friends, I know that this old lady is now sleeping very profoundly because she is breathing very deeply. Let us silently steal butter and yogurt without making any disturbance.\u201d But the old lady, Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, was not sleeping; so she could not contain her smiling, and her teeth immediately became distinctly visible. This is an instance ofvihasitasmiling.",
            "In a state of smiling when the nose becomes puffed and the eyes squint, the smiling is calledavahasita.Once, early in the morning when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned home after performing Hisr\u0101sadance, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 looked upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s face and addressed Him thus: \u201cMy dear son, why do Your eyes look like they have been smeared with some oxides? Have You dressed Yourself with the blue garments of Baladeva?\u201d When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was addressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in that way, a girlfriend who was nearby began to smile with a puffed nose and squinting eyes. This is an instance ofavahasitasmiling. Thegop\u012bknew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been enjoying ther\u0101sadance and that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 could not detect her son\u2019s activities or understand how He had become covered with thegop\u012bs\u2019 makeup. Her smiling was in theavahasitafeature.",
            "When tears from the eyes are added to the smiling and the shoulders are shaking, the smile is calledapahasita.When child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was dancing in response to the singing of the old maidservant Jarat\u012b, N\u0101rada was astonished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who controls all the movements of great demigods like Brahm\u0101, was now dancing to the indications of an old maidservant. Seeing this fun, N\u0101rada also began to dance, and his shoulders trembled and his eyes moved. Due to his smiling, his teeth also became visible, and on account of the glaring effulgence from his teeth, the clouds in the skies turned silver.",
            "When a smiling person claps his hands and leaps in the air, the smiling expression changes intoatihasita,or overwhelming laughter. An example ofatihasitawas manifested in the following incident. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once addressed Jarat\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear good woman, the skin of your face is now slackened, and so your face exactly resembles a monkey\u2019s. As such, the king of the monkeys, Bal\u012bmukha, has selected you as his worthy wife.\u201d While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was teasing Jarat\u012b in this way, she replied that she was certainly aware of the fact that the king of the monkeys was trying to marry her, but she had already taken shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the killer of many powerful demons, and therefore she had already decided to marry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instead of the king of the monkeys. On hearing this sarcastic reply by the talkative Jarat\u012b, all the cowherd girls present there began to laugh very loudly and clap their hands. This laughter accompanied by the clapping of hands is calledatihasita.",
            "Sometimes there are indirect sarcastic remarks that also createatihasitacircumstances. An example of one such remark is a statement which was made by one of the cowherd girls to Ku\u1e6dil\u0101, the daughter of Ja\u1e6dil\u0101 and sister of Abhimanyu, the so-called husband of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Indirectly Ku\u1e6dil\u0101 was insulted by the following statement: \u201cMy dear Ku\u1e6dil\u0101, daughter of Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, your breasts are as long as string beans\u00a0\u2013 simply dry and long. Your nose is so gorgeous that it defies the beauty of the noses of frogs. And your eyes are more beautiful than the eyes of dogs. Your lips defy the flaming cinders of fire, and your abdomen is as beautiful as a big drum. Therefore, my dear beautiful Ku\u1e6dil\u0101, you are the most beautiful of all the cowherd girls of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and because of your extraordinary beauty, I think you must be beyond the attraction of the sweet blowing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute!\u201d"

            "Astonishment and Chivalry",
            "ASTONISHMENT",
            "The ecstasy of astonishment in devotional service is perceived in two ways: directly, by the experience of one\u2019s own eyes, and indirectly, by hearing from others.",
            "When N\u0101rada came to see the activities of the Lord at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and he saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present within every palace in the same body and was engaged in different activities, he was struck with wonder. This is one of the examples of astonishment in devotional service by direct perception. One of the friends of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 said, \u201cYa\u015bod\u0101, just see the fun! On the one hand, there is your child, who is always captivated by sucking the milk from your breast, and on the other hand there is the great Govardhana Hill, which can obstruct the passing of the clouds. But still, just see how wonderful it is that this great Govardhana Hill is resting on the finger of your child\u2019s left hand just as though it were a toy. Is this not very mysterious?\u201d This statement is another example of astonishment in devotional service by direct perception.",
            "An instance of astonishment in devotional service by indirect perception occurred when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it heard from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s killing Narak\u0101sura, who had been fighting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with elevenak\u1e63auhi\u1e47\u012bdivisions of soldiers. Each division ofak\u1e63auhi\u1e47\u012bsoldiers contained several thousand elephants, several thousand horses and chariots and several hundreds of thousands of infantry soldiers. Narak\u0101sura possessed eleven such divisions, and all of them were throwing arrows toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed them all simply by throwing three arrows from His side. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it heard of this wonderful victory, he immediately rubbed the tears from his eyes and became overwhelmed with joy. This instance is an example of astonishment in devotional service by indirect perception through aural reception.",
            "There is another example of indirect astonishment. Trying to test K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to see if He were truly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahm\u0101 stole all the cowherd boys and cows from Him. But after a few seconds, he saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was still present with all the cows, calves and cowherd boys exactly in the same way as before. When Lord Brahm\u0101 described this incident to his associates on the Satyaloka planet, they all became astonished. Brahm\u0101 told them that after taking away all the boys, he saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a again playing with the same boys in the same fashion. Their bodily complexion was blackish, almost like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, and they all had four arms. The same calves and cows were still present there in the same original fashion. Even while describing this incident, Brahm\u0101 became almost overwhelmed. \u201cAnd the most astonishing thing,\u201d he added, \u201cwas that many other Brahm\u0101s from many different universes had also come there to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His associates.\u201d",
            "Similarly, when there was a forest fire in the Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bra-vana, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed His friends to close their eyes tightly, and they all did this. Then when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had extinguished the fire, the cowherd boys opened their eyes and saw that they had been relieved from the danger and that their cows and calves were all safe. They began to perceive the wonder of the situation simply by guessing how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had saved them. This is another instance of indirect perception causing astonishment in devotional service.",
            "The activities of a person, even if they are not very extraordinary, create an impression of wonder in the heart and mind of the person\u2019s friends. But even very wonderful activities performed by a person who is not one\u2019s friend will not create any impression. It is because of love that one\u2019s wonderful activities create an impression in the mind.",
            "CHIVALRY",
            "When on account of love and devotional service for the Lord there is special valorous enthusiasm, the resultant activities are called chivalrous. These chivalrous activities can be manifested in the acts of mock fighting, giving charity, showing mercy and executing religious principles. By performing chivalrous activities in fighting, one is calledyuddha-v\u012bra.By charitable activities one is calledd\u0101na-v\u012bra.By showing extraordinary mercy one is calledday\u0101-v\u012bra.And when one is munificent in executing religious rites, he is calleddharma-v\u012bra.In all such different chivalrous activities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object.",
            "When a friend wants to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by performing some chivalrous activities, the friend becomes the challenger and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself becomes the opponent; or else K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may give audience to the fighting and by His desire another friend becomes the opponent. A friend once challenged K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear M\u0101dhava, You are very restless because You think that no one can defeat You. But if You do not flee from here, then I shall show You how I can defeat You. And my friends will be very satisfied to see this!\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 were very intimate friends, yet \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, out of anger with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, challenged Him. When both of them began to fight, all the friends on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 enjoyed the wonderful fighting of the two friends. They prepared some arrows for mock fighting, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to throw His arrows at \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101. \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 began to block these arrows by whirling his pole, and by \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101\u2019s chivalrous activities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became very satisfied. Such mock fighting generally takes place among chivalrous persons and creates wonderful excitement for all viewers.",
            "There is a statement in theHari-va\u1e41\u015bathat sometimes Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fought in the presence of Kunt\u012b, and Arjuna would be defeated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "In such chivalrous fighting between friends, there is sometimes bragging, complacence, pride, power, taking to weapons, challenging and standing as an opponent. All of these symptoms become impetuses to chivalrous devotional service.",
            "One friend challenged K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thus: \u201cMy dear friend D\u0101modara, You are an expert only in eating. You have defeated Subala only because he is weak and You adopted cheating means. Don\u2019t advertise Yourself to be a great fighter by such action. You have advertised Yourself as a serpent, and I am the peacock who will now defeat You.\u201d The peacock is the ablest enemy of the serpent.",
            "In such fighting between friends, when the self-advertisement becomes personal, learned scholars say that it is subecstasy. When there is a roaring challenge, certain kinds of movement for fighting, enthusiasm, no weapons, and assurance given to frightened witnesses\u00a0\u2013 all these chivalrous activities are called subecstasy.",
            "One friend addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this manner: \u201cMy dear Madhus\u016bdana, You know my strength, yet You are encouraging Bhadrasena, and not me, to challenge mighty Baladeva. By this action You are simply insulting me, because my arms are as strong as the bolts of the gate!\u201d",
            "A devotee once said, \u201cMy dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, may Your challenger \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 become glorious for his chivalrous activities, such as vibrating like a thundercloud and roaring like a lion. May all glories go to \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101\u2019s chivalrous activities!\u201d Chivalrous activities in the matter of fighting, charity, mercy and execution of religious rituals are called constitutional, whereas expressions of pride, emotion, endurance, kindness, determination, jubilation, enthusiasm, jealousy and remembrance are called unconstitutional. When Stoka-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one of the many friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was fighting with Him, his father chastised him for fighting with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was the life and soul of all residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Upon hearing these chastisements, Stoka-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stopped his fighting. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continued to challenge him, and thus, in order to meet the challenge, Stoka-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took his pole and began to display his dexterity by whirling it.",
            "Once \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 challenged Bhadrasena and said to him, \u201cMy dear friend, you needn\u2019t be afraid of me yet. I shall first of all defeat our brother Balar\u0101ma, then I shall beat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then I shall come to you.\u201d Bhadrasena therefore left the party of Balar\u0101ma and joined K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he agitated his friends as much as the Mandara Hill had agitated the whole ocean. By his roaring sounds he deafened all his friends, and he inspired K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his chivalrous activities.",
            "Once K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a challenged all His friends and said, \u201cMy dear friends, just see\u00a0\u2013 I am jumping with great chivalrous prowess. Please do not flee away.\u201d Upon hearing these challenging words, a friend named Var\u016bthapa counterchallenged the Lord and struggled against Him.",
            "One of the friends once remarked, \u201cSud\u0101m\u0101 is trying his best to see D\u0101modara defeated, and I think that if our powerful Subala joins him, they will be a very beautiful combination, like a valuable jewel bedecked with gold.\u201d",
            "In these chivalrous activities, only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends can be the opponents. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s enemies can never actually be His opponents. Therefore, this challenging by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends is called devotional service in chivalrous activities.",
            "D\u0101na-v\u012bra,or chivalry in giving charity, may be divided into two parts: munificence and renunciation. A person who can sacrifice everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called munificent. When a person desires to make a sacrifice because of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called the impetus of the munificent activity. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, in clear consciousness Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja desired all auspiciousness for his son and thus began to give valuable cows in charity to all thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as.Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswere so satisfied by this charitable action that they were obliged to say that the charity of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had excelled the charity of such past kings as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu and N\u1e5bga.",
            "When a person knows the glories of the Lord completely and is prepared to sacrifice everything for the Lord, he is calledsamprad\u0101naka,or one who gives everything in charity for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira went with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the arena of the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice, in his imagination he began to anoint the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with pulp of sandalwood, he decorated K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with a garland hanging down to His knees, he gave K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a garments all embroidered with gold, he gave K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ornaments all bedecked with valuable jewels, and he gave K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a many fully decorated elephants, chariots and horses. He further wished to give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in charity his kingdom, his family and his personal self also. After so desiring, when there was nothing actually to give in charity, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira became very perturbed and anxious.",
            "Similarly, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali once told his priest, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, \u201cMy dear sage, you are fully expert in knowledge of theVedas,and as such you worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, by Vedic rituals. As far as thisbr\u0101hma\u1e47adwarf [the incarnation V\u0101mana-deva] is concerned, if He is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, a simplebr\u0101hma\u1e47aor even my enemy, I have decided to give to Him in charity all the land He has asked for.\u201d Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali was so fortunate that the Lord extended before him His hand, which was reddish from touching the breast of the goddess of fortune, who is always smeared with redku\u1e45kumapowder. In other words, although the Personality of Godhead is so great that the goddess of fortune is always under His command for enjoyment, He still extended His hands to take charity from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali.",
            "A person who wants to give everything in charity to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but does not want anything in return is considered the real renouncer. Thus, a devotee will refuse to accept any kind of liberation, even if it is offered by the Lord. Real love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes manifested when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes the recipient of charity and the devotee becomes the giver.",
            "In theHari-bhakti-sudhodayathere is another example, forwarded by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva. He says there, \u201cMy dear Lord, I have practiced austerities and penances because I was desiring to receive something from You, but in exchange You have allowed me to see You, who are never visible even to the great sages and saintly persons. I had been searching out some pieces of broken glass, but instead I have found the most valuable jewel. I am therefore fully satisfied, my Lord. I do not wish to ask anything more from Your Lordship.\u201d",
            "A similar statement is to be found in the Third Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,fifteenth chapter, verse 48. The four sages headed by Sanaka Muni addressed the Lord as follows: \u201cDear Supreme Personality of Godhead, Your reputation is very attractive and free from all material contamination. Therefore You are worthy of being glorified and are actually the reservoir of all places of pilgrimage. Auspicious persons who are fortunate enough to be engaged in glorifying Your attributes and who actually know what Your transcendental position is do not even care to accept liberation offered by You. Because they are so transcendentally enriched, they do not care to accept even the post of Indra, the heavenly king. They know that the post of the king of heaven is also fearful, whereas for those who are engaged in glorifying Your transcendental qualities there is only joyfulness and freedom from all danger. As such, why should persons with this knowledge be attracted by a post in the heavenly kingdom?\u201d",
            "One devotee has described his feelings about the charity exhibited by King May\u016bradhvaja: \u201cI am faltering even to speak about the activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja May\u016bradhvaja, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.\u201d May\u016bradhvaja was very intelligent, and he could understand why K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came to him once, in the garb of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demanded from him half of his body, to be sawed off by his wife and son, and King May\u016bradhvaja agreed to this proposal. On account of his intense feeling of devotional service, King May\u016bradhvaja was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when he understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had come in the garb of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,he did not hesitate to part with half of his body. This sacrifice of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja May\u016bradhvaja for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sake is unique in the world, and we should offer our all-respectful obeisances to him. He had full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the garb of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,and he is known as the perfectd\u0101na-v\u012bra,or renouncer.",
            "Any person who is always ready to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who is always dexterous in executing devotional service is calleddharma-v\u012bra,or chivalrous in executing religious rituals. Only advanced devotees performing religious ritualistic performances can come to this stage ofdharma-v\u012bra. Dharma-v\u012brasare produced after going through the authoritative scriptures, following moral principles, being faithful and tolerant and controlling the senses. Persons who execute religious rituals for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are steady in devotional service, whereas persons who execute religious rituals without intending to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are only called pious.",
            "The best example of adharma-v\u012brais Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. A devotee once told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O killer of all demons, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the eldest son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, has performed all kinds of sacrifices just to please You. He has always invited the heavenly king, Indra, to take part in theyaj\u00f1as[sacrifices]. Because King Indra was thus absent so often from \u015aac\u012bdev\u012b, she had to pass much of her time pining over Indra\u2019s absence, with her cheeks upon her hands.\u201d",
            "The performance of differentyaj\u00f1asfor the demigods is considered to be worship of the limbs of the Supreme Lord. The demigods are considered to be different parts of the universal body of the Lord, and therefore the ultimate purpose in worshiping them is to please the Lord by partially worshiping His different limbs. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had no such material desire; he executed all sacrifices under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and not to take any personal advantage from them. He desired only to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and was therefore called the best of the devotees. He was always merged in the ocean of loving service."

            "When the ecstasy of devotional service produces some kind of lamentation in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called devotional service in compassion. The impetuses for this devotional service are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental quality, form and activities. In this ecstasy of devotional service there are sometimes symptoms like regret, heavy breathing, crying, falling on the ground and beating upon one\u2019s chest. Sometimes symptoms like laziness, frustration, defamation, humility, anxiety, moroseness, eagerness, restlessness, madness, death, forgetfulness, disease and illusion are also visible. When in the heart of a devotee there is expectation of some mishap to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a it is called devotional service in bereavement. Such bereavement is another symptom of this devotional service in compassion.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,Tenth Canto, sixteenth chapter, verse 10, there is the following description. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was chastising the K\u0101liya-n\u0101ga in the Yamun\u0101, the big snake wrapped his coils all over K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, and upon seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this situation, all His dear cowherd friends became greatly disturbed. Out of bereavement, distress and fear, they became bewildered and began to fall on the ground. Because the cowherd boys were under the illusion that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could be in some mishap, their symptoms are not at all astonishing; they had dedicated their friendship, their possessions, their desires and their very selves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered the Yamun\u0101 River, which had become very poisonous from the presence of K\u0101liya, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 feared all kinds of mishaps, and she was breathing hotly. Tears from her eyes were soaking her clothes, and she was almost collapsing.",
            "Similarly, when the \u015aa\u1e45kh\u0101sura demon was attacking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s queens one after another, Lord Baladeva became more and more bluish.",
            "In theHa\u1e41sa-d\u016bta,the following incident is described. Thegop\u012bsrequested Ha\u1e41sa-d\u016bta to search after the marks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet and to accept them as Lord Brahm\u0101 had accepted them on his helmet after he had stolen all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s cowherd boys. Regretting his challenge to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord Brahm\u0101 had bowed down before the Lord, and his helmet became marked with the footprints of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thegop\u012bsreminded Ha\u1e41sa-d\u016bta that sometimes even the great sage N\u0101rada becomes very ecstatic by seeing these footprints, and sometimes great liberated sages also aspire to see them. \u201cYou should therefore seek very enthusiastically to find the footprints of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d they urged. This is another instance of devotional service in compassion.",
            "There is an instance when Sahadeva, the younger brother of Nakula, became greatly gladdened at seeing the effulgent glowing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s footprints. He began to cry and call out, \u201cMother M\u0101dr\u012b! Where are you now? Father P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du! Where are you now? I am very sorry that you are not here to see these footprints of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d This is another instance of devotional service in compassion.",
            "In devotional service without strong attraction to the Lord, there may sometimes be smiling and other symptoms, but never the stress or lamentation that are symptoms of devotional service in compassion. The basic principle of this compassion is always ecstatic love. The apprehension of some mishap to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or to His beloved queens, as exhibited by Baladeva and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, has been explained above. This apprehension is due not exactly to their ignorance of the inconceivable potencies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but to their intense love for Him. This kind of apprehension of some mishap to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first of all becomes manifested as an object of lamentation, but gradually it develops into such compassionate loving ecstasy that it turns to another channel and gives transcendental pleasure.",
            "ANGER",
            "In ecstatic loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in anger, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always the object. InVidagdha-m\u0101dhava,second act, verse 37, Lalit\u0101-gop\u012b expressed her anger, which was caused by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when she addressed \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thus: \u201cMy dear friend, my inner desires have been polluted. Therefore I shall go to the place of Yamar\u0101ja. But I am sorry to see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has still not given up His smiling over cheating You. I do not know how You could repose all Your loving propensities upon this lusty young boy from the neighborhood of the cowherds.\u201d",
            "After seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Jarat\u012b sometimes said, \u201cO You thief of young girls\u2019 properties! I can distinctly see the covering garment of my daughter-in-law on Your person.\u201d Then she cried very loudly, addressing all the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to inform them that this son of King Nanda was setting fire to the household life of her daughter-in-law.",
            "Similar ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in anger was expressed by Rohi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b when she heard the roaring sound of the two fallingarjunatrees to which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been tied. The whole neighborhood proceeded immediately toward the place where the accident had taken place, and Rohi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b took the opportunity to rebuke mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 as follows: \u201cYou may be very expert in giving lessons to your son by binding Him with rope, but don\u2019t you look to see if your son is in a dangerous spot? The trees are falling on the ground, and He is simply loitering there!\u201d This expression of Rohi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b\u2019s anger toward Ya\u015bod\u0101 is an example of ecstatic love in anger caused by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Once, while K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in the pasturing ground with His cowherd boys, His friends requested Him to go to the T\u0101lavana forest, where Gardabh\u0101sura, a disturbing demon in the shape of an ass, resided. The friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to eat the fruit from the forest trees, but they could not go because of fear of the demon. Thus they requested K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to go there and kill Gardabh\u0101sura. After K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did this, they all returned home, and their report of the day\u2019s activity perturbed mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been sent alone into such danger in the T\u0101lavana forest. Thus she looked upon the boys with anger.",
            "There is another instance of anger on the part of a friend of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s. When R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was dissatisfied with the behavior of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and had stopped talking with Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was very sorry for R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s great dissatisfaction, and in order to beg forgiveness, He fell down at Her lotus feet. But even after this R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was not satisfied and She did not talk with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At that time, one of Her friends chastised Her in the following words: \u201cMy dear friend, You are allowing Yourself to be churned by the rod of dissatisfaction, so what can I say unto You? The only advice I can give You is that You had better leave this scene immediately, because Your misbehavior is giving me too much pain. I cannot bear to see Your behavior, because even though K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s peacock feather has touched Your feet, You still appear to be red-faced.\u201d",
            "The above attitudes of dissatisfaction and anger in devotional service are called\u012br\u1e63yu.",
            "When Akr\u016bra was leaving V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, some of the elderlygop\u012bsrebuked him as follows: \u201cO son of G\u0101ndin\u012b, your cruelty is defaming the dynasty of King Yadu. You are taking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a away, keeping us in such a pitiable condition without Him. Now, even before you have left, the life air of all thegop\u012bshas practically disappeared.\u201d",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was insulted by \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la in the assembly of the R\u0101jas\u016byayaj\u00f1aconvened by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, there was a great turmoil among the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Kurus, involving grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. At that time Nakula said with great anger, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the nails of His toes are beautified by the light emanating from the jeweled helmets of the authorities of theVedas.If He is derided by anyone, I declare herewith as a P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava that I will kick his helmet with my left foot and I will strike him with my arrows, which are as good as theyama-da\u1e47\u1e0da,the scepter of Yamar\u0101ja!\u201d This is an instance of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in anger.",
            "In such a transcendental angry mood sometimes sarcastic remarks, unfavorable glances and insulting words are exhibited. Sometimes there are other symptoms, like rubbing of the two hands, clacking of the teeth, clamping of the lips, moving of the eyebrows, scratching of the arms, lowering of the head, rapid breathing, uttering of strong words, nodding of the head, yellowishness at the corners of the eyes and trembling lips. Sometimes the eyes turn red and sometimes they fade. And there are sometimes chastisement and silence. All these symptoms of anger may be divided into two parts: constitutional and unconstitutional, or permanent and temporary symptoms. Sometimes great emotion, bewilderment, pride, frustration, illusion, impotence, jealousy, dexterity, negligence and signs of hard labor are also manifest as unconstitutional symptoms.",
            "In all these humors of ecstatic love, the feeling of anger is accepted as the steady factor.",
            "When Jar\u0101sandha angrily attacked the city of Mathur\u0101, he looked at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with sarcastic glances. At that time Baladeva took up His plow weapon and gazed upon Jar\u0101sandha with colored eyes.",
            "There is a statement in theVidagdha-m\u0101dhavawherein \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, in an angry mood, addressed Paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b after she had accused R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b of going to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cMy dear mother,\u201d R\u0101dh\u0101 declared, \u201cwhat can I say to you? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so cruel that He often attacks Me on the street, and if I want to cry out very loudly, this boy with a peacock feather on His head immediately covers My face so that I cannot cry. And if I want to go away from the scene because I am afraid of Him, He will immediately spread His arms to block My path. If I piteously fall down at His feet, then this enemy of the Madhu demon, in an angry mood, bites My face! Mother, just try to understand My situation, and don\u2019t be unnecessarily angry with Me. Instead, please tell Me how I can save Myself from these terrible attacks by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d",
            "Sometimes among contemporary personalities there are signs of ecstasy in anger because of love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An example of such anger was exhibited in a quarrel between Ja\u1e6dil\u0101 and Mukhar\u0101. Ja\u1e6dil\u0101 was the mother-in-law of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, and Mukhar\u0101 was Her great-grandmother. Both of them were talking about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s unnecessary harassment of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b when She was walking in the street. Ja\u1e6dil\u0101 said, \u201cYou cruel-faced Mukhar\u0101! By hearing your words my heart feels like it is burning in a fire!\u201d And Mukhar\u0101 replied, \u201cYou sinful Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, by hearing your words, there is aching in my head! You cannot give any evidence that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has attacked R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, the daughter of my granddaughter K\u012brtid\u0101.\u201d",
            "Once, when R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was taking off the necklace given to Her by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Ja\u1e6dil\u0101, her mother-in-law, told a friend, \u201cMy dear friend, just see the beautiful necklace that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has presented to R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. She is now holding it, but still She wants to tell us that She has no connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This girl\u2019s activities have disgraced our whole family!\u201d",
            "Natural jealousy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by persons like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la cannot be accepted as ecstatic love in anger with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "Dread and Ghastliness",
            "DREAD",
            "In ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in dread, there are two causes of fear: either K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself or some dreadful situation for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When a devotee feels himself to be an offender at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself becomes the object of dreadful ecstatic love. And when, out of ecstatic love, friends and well-wishers of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a apprehend some danger for Him, that situation becomes the object of their dread.",
            "When \u1e5ak\u1e63ar\u0101ja was in front of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fighting and suddenly realized that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a addressed him thus: \u201cMy dear \u1e5ak\u1e63ar\u0101ja, why is your face so dry? Please do not feel threatened by Me. There is no need for your heart to tremble like this. Please calm yourself down. I have no anger toward you. You may, however, become as angry as you like with Me\u00a0\u2013 to expand your service in fighting with Me and to increase My sporting attitude.\u201d In this dreadful situation in ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the object of dread.",
            "There is another instance of a dreadful situation with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the object as follows. After being sufficiently chastised by child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Yamun\u0101 River, the K\u0101liya snake began to address the Lord, \u201cO killer of the Mura demon, I have acquired many mystic powers by my austerity and penances, but before You I am nothing; I am most insignificant. Therefore, please be kind upon a poor soul like me, and don\u2019t be angry with me. I did not know Your actual position, and out of ignorance I have committed such horrible offenses. Please save me. I am a most unfortunate, foolish creature. Please be merciful to me.\u201d This is another instance of the ecstasy of dread in devotional service.",
            "When the Ke\u015b\u012b demon was causing disturbances in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by assuming a large horse\u2019s body that was so big that he could jump over the trees, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 told her husband, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cOur child is very restless, so we had better keep Him locked up within the house. I have been very worried about the recent disturbances of the Ke\u015b\u012b demon, who has been assuming the form of a giant horse.\u201d When it was learned that the demon was entering Gokula in an angry mood, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 became so anxious to protect her child that her face dried up and there were tears in her eyes. These are some of the signs of the ecstasy of dread in devotional service caused by seeing and hearing something that is dangerous to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "After the P\u016btan\u0101 witch had been killed, some friends of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 inquired from her about the incident. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 at once requested her friends, \u201cPlease stop! Please stop! Don\u2019t bring up the incident of P\u016btan\u0101. I become distressed just by remembering this incident. The P\u016btan\u0101 witch came to devour my son, and she deceived me into letting her take the child on her lap. After that, she died and made a tumultuous sound with her gigantic body.\u201d",
            "In the ecstasy of devotional service in dread, the unconstitutional symptoms are drying up of the mouth, exuberance, glancing behind oneself, concealing oneself, bewilderment, searching after the endangered lovable object and crying very loudly. Some other unconstitutional symptoms are illusion, forgetfulness and expectation of danger. In all such circumstances the ecstatic dread is the steady or constant factor. Such dread is caused either by offenses committed or by dreadful circumstances. Offenses may be committed in varieties of ways, and the dread is felt by the person who has committed the offense. When dread is caused by a fearful object, this fearful object is generally a person who is fearsome in his features, nature and influence. An example of an object that caused ecstatic dread is the P\u016btan\u0101 witch. Dread may be caused by mischievous demoniac characters, such as King Ka\u1e41sa, and it may be caused by great powerful demigods, such as Indra or \u015aa\u1e45kara.",
            "Demons like Ka\u1e41sa feared K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but their feelings cannot be described as ecstatic dread in devotional service.",
            "GHASTLINESS",
            "It is understood from authoritative sources that an attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of feelings of disgust sometimes presents a ghastly ecstasy in devotional service. The person experiencing such ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is almost always in the neutral stage of devotional service, or\u015b\u0101nta-rasa.A description of ecstatic love caused by ghastliness is found in the following statement: \u201cThis person was formerly interested solely in the matter of lust and sense gratification, and he had perfected the greatest skill in exploiting women to fulfill his lusty desires. But now how wonderful it is that this same man is chanting the names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with tears in his eyes, and as soon as he sees the face of a woman, he immediately becomes disgusted. From the indication of his face, I would think that now he hates sex life.\u201d",
            "In this mellow of devotional service in ghastliness, the subecstatic symptoms are spitting upon the consideration of one\u2019s past life, contorting the face, covering the nose and washing the hands. There is also trembling of the body, forcible twisting of the body and perspiration. Other symptoms that may be present are shame, exhaustion, madness, illusion, frustration, humility, self-pity, restlessness, eagerness and stunning of the body.",
            "When a devotee, lamenting for his past abominable activities, shows special symptoms on his body, his feeling is called ecstasy in devotional service in ghastliness. This is caused by the awakening of his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In this connection there is the following statement: \u201cHow can a person take pleasure in the enjoyment of sex life in this body, which is a bag of skin and bones, filled with blood and covered by skin and flesh, and which produces mucus and evil smells?\u201d This perception is possible only for one who is awakened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and who has become fully cognizant of the abominable nature of this material body.",
            "A fortunate child in the womb of his mother prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as follows: \u201cO enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, I am suffering so much because of this material body. Now I am trapped within a mess of blood, urine and liquid stool within the womb of my mother. Because I am living in such a condition, I am suffering great pangs. Therefore, O divine ocean of mercy, please be kind to me. I have no ability to engage in Your loving devotional service, but please save me!\u201d There is a similar statement by a person fallen in a hellish condition of life. He addressed the Supreme Lord thus: \u201cMy dear Lord, Yamar\u0101ja has placed me in a situation that is full of filthy and obnoxious smells. There are so many insects and worms, surrounded by the stools left by different kinds of diseased persons. And after seeing this horrible scene, my eyes have become sore and I am becoming nearly blind. I therefore pray, O my Lord, O deliverer from the hellish conditions of life. I have fallen into this hell, but I shall try to remember Your holy name always, and in this way I shall try to keep my body and soul together.\u201d This is another instance of ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in an abominable situation.",
            "It is to be understood that any person who is constantly engaged in chanting the holy names of the Lord\u00a0\u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u00a0\u2013 has attained a transcendental affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as such, in any condition of life, he remains satisfied simply by remembering the Lord\u2019s name in full affection and ecstatic love.",
            "In conclusion, it may be stated that ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in ghastliness appears during the development of dormant neutrality into developed affection."

            "As already described, there are twelve different kinds ofrasas,or ecstatic relationships that are shared with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Five of theserasasare direct, and they are listed as neutrality, servitude, fraternal love, parental love and conjugal love. Seven of therasasare indirect, and they are listed as humor, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, anger, dread and ghastliness. The five directrasasare eternally manifested in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, the spiritual kingdom, whereas the seven indirectrasasare eternally manifesting and unmanifesting in Gokula V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a displays His transcendental pastimes in the material world.",
            "Very often, in addition to one\u2019s regularrasa,there is found the presence of some otherrasa,and the mixture of these loving humors is sometimes compatible, or palatable, and sometimes incompatible, or unpalatable. The following is a scientific analysis of the compatibility and incompatibility of the mixtures of these variousrasas,or loving moods.",
            "When in therasaof neutral love (\u015b\u0101nta-rasa) there are found traces of ghastliness or astonishment, the result is compatible. When with this neutral love there are manifestations of conjugal love, chivalry, anger or dread, the result is incompatible.",
            "When in the ecstasy of a serving humor there are manifestations of dread, neutral love or chivalry (such asdharma-v\u012braandd\u0101na-v\u012bra), the result is compatible. The ecstasy of devotional service in chivalry (yuddha-v\u012bra) and anger are directly produced by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.",
            "With the ecstasy of fraternal love a mixture of conjugal love, laughter or chivalry is highly compatible. With the same fraternal love, a mixture of dread or parental love is most incompatible.",
            "Although there are gulfs of differences between them, with the ecstasy of parental affection a mixture of laughter, compassion or dread is compatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of parental love a mixture of conjugal love, chivalry or anger is incompatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of devotion in conjugal love a mixture of laughter or fraternity is compatible.",
            "According to certain expert opinions, in the ecstasy of conjugal love the feelings of chivalry known asyuddha-v\u012braanddharma-v\u012braare the only compatible additions. According to this view, except for these two humors, all other manifestations are taken as incompatible with conjugal love.",
            "With the ecstasy of devotional laughter a mixture of dread, conjugal love or parental love is compatible, whereas a mixture of compassion or ghastliness is incompatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of devotion in astonishment a mixture of chivalry or neutral love is compatible, whereas a mixture of anger or dread is always incompatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of devotional chivalry a mixture of astonishment, laughter or servitude is compatible, whereas a mixture of dread or conjugal love is incompatible. According to some expert opinions, the ecstasy of neutral love is always compatible with devotional service in chivalry.",
            "With the ecstasy of compassion in devotional service a mixture of anger or parental love is compatible, whereas a mixture of laughter, conjugal love or astonishment is always incompatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of anger in devotional service a mixture of compassion or chivalry is compatible, whereas a mixture of laughter, conjugal union or dread is completely incompatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of dread in devotional service a mixture of ghastliness or compassion is compatible.",
            "With the ecstasy of chivalry in devotional service a mixture of conjugal union, laughter or anger is always incompatible.",
            "In the ecstasy of ghastliness in devotional service, feelings of neutral love, laughter or servitude are compatible, whereas feelings of conjugal union and fraternity are incompatible.",
            "The above analysis is a sample of the study ofras\u0101bh\u0101sa,or incompatible mixing ofrasas.This transcendental science ofras\u0101bh\u0101sacan thoroughly explain the humors in ecstatic love that are compatible and incompatible with one another. When Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was residing in Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b, many poets and devotees used to come to Him and offer their different kinds of poetry, but the regulation was that Lord Caitanya\u2019s secretary, Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara, first examined all of these writings scrutinizingly, and if he would find that there were no incompatibilities in therasas,or transcendental mellows, he would then allow the poet to approach Lord Caitanya and recite his poetry.",
            "The topic of incompatibility is a very important one, and those who are pure devotees always expect to find perfect compatibility in descriptions of the different relationships with the Personality of Godhead. The study of compatibility and incompatibility sometimes becomes very involved, and a hint of why this is so is given as follows. When a friend meets another friend, the mellow produced out of that meeting is generally taken as very palatable. But actually with such meetings between two friends, there are so many feelings involved that it is difficult to ascertain when these feelings are actually becoming compatible and when they are becoming incompatible.",
            "Expert literary scholars have analyzed therasasthat are compatible with one another by contrasting the variousrasasin a particular mixture under the nameswholeandpart.According to this method, the prominent feeling is called the whole, and the subordinate feeling is called the part.",
            "The following statement elucidates the subject of part and whole: \u201cAll living entities are just like sparks from the supreme fire, and as such, I do not know if I, a tiny spark, shall be able to engage myself in the transcendental loving service of this supreme fire, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In this statement, the feelings of neutral love are taken as the whole, whereas the desire to serve the Lord is taken as the part. Actually, in the Brahman effulgence there is no chance for reciprocation of loving ecstasy between the Lord and the devotee.",
            "There is another quotation, from a devotee who laments as follows: \u201cAlas, I am still trying to relish different pleasurable states from this body, which is simply some skin covering mucus, semen and blood. In this state of consciousness I am so condemned that I cannot relish the transcendental ecstasy of remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d In this statement there are two ecstatic loving humors, namely, neutrality and ghastliness. Neutrality is taken here as the whole, whereas the ecstasy of ghastliness is the part.",
            "There is a similar statement by a devotee as follows: \u201cI shall now begin my service of fanning the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is seated on a golden throne. He is the supreme Param-brahma in His eternal transcendental form of a cloudy blackish complexion. Now I shall give up my affection for my material body, which is nothing but a bunch of flesh and blood.\u201d Herein also there is a combination of servitude and ghastliness, where the ecstasy of servitude is taken as the whole and the ecstasy of ghastliness is taken as the part.",
            "There is another statement as follows: \u201cWhen shall I be freed from the mode of ignorance? And being thus purified, when shall I attain the stage of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally? Only then shall I be able to worship Him, always observing His lotus eyes and beautiful face.\u201d In this statement the whole is the ecstasy of neutrality and the part is servitorship.",
            "There is another statement as follows: \u201cPlease look at this devotee of the Lord who is dancing just from remembering the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply by observing his dance you will lose all interest in even the most beautiful women!\u201d In this statement the whole is in neutrality and the part is in ghastliness.",
            "One devotee boldly said, \u201cMy dear Lord, now I am turning my face from any thought of association with young girls. As far as Brahman realization is concerned, I have lost all interest because I am completely absorbed in thinking about You. And being absorbed so blissfully, I have lost all other desires, even the desire for mystic powers. Now my mind is attracted only to worshiping Your lotus feet.\u201d In this statement, the whole is the ecstasy of neutrality and the part is chivalry.",
            "In another statement, Subala is addressed thus: \u201cMy dear Subala, the damsels of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana who had the opportunity of enjoying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s kissing must be the foremost of all the fortunate women in the world.\u201d In this example, the ecstasy of fraternal devotional service is the whole and the ecstasy of conjugal love is the part.",
            "The following statement was made by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to thegop\u012bs:\u201cMy dear enchanted, don\u2019t gaze at Me with longing eyes like this. Be satisfied and return to your homes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. There is no necessity of your presence here.\u201d While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was joking in this way with the damsels of Vraja, who with great hope had come to enjoy ther\u0101sadance with Him, Subala was also on the scene, and he began to look at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with wide and laughing eyes. Subala\u2019s feeling contained a mixture of fraternity and laughter in devotional service. Fraternity is considered here to be the whole and the laughter is considered the part.",
            "The following example contains a mixture of ecstatic fraternity and laughter, taken respectively as the whole and part. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saw that Subala, in the dress of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, was silently hiding under the shade of a beautifula\u015bokatree on the bank of the Yamun\u0101, He immediately arose from His seat in surprise. Upon seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Subala tried to hide his laughter by covering his cheeks.",
            "There is also an example of a mixture of parental love and compassion in devotional service. When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was thinking that her son was walking in the forest without any umbrella or shoes, she became greatly perturbed to think of how much difficulty K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must have been feeling. In this example the whole is the parental love and the part is compassion.",
            "There is the following example of a mixture of parental love and laughter. A friend of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 told her, \u201cMy dear Ya\u015bod\u0101, your son has very cunningly stolen a lump of butter from my home. And to make me blame my own son for His mischief He has smeared some of the butter on my son\u2019s face while he was sleeping!\u201d Upon hearing this, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 shook her curved eyebrows. She could only look at her friend with a smiling face. May mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 bless everyone with this smiling attitude. In this example the whole is the parental love and the part is the laughter.",
            "There is an example of a mixture of several humors with devotional service as follows. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was holding up Govardhana Hill with His left hand, His hair became scattered all over His shoulders and He appeared to be perspiring. When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 saw this scene, she began to tremble. Then, as she stared at the scene with broadened eyes, she saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a begin to exhibit varieties of facial caricatures. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 then became very happy and began to smile. Then again, when she thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was holding up the hill for such an extremely long time, her clothes became soaked with perspiration. May mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 Vraje\u015bvar\u012b protect the whole universe by her infinite mercy! In this example, the whole is parental love and the parts are dread, wonder, laughter, compassion, etc.",
            "There is an example of a mixture of conjugal love and fraternal affection when \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b said, \u201cMy dear friends, just see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is resting His hand on the shoulder of Subala, who is dressed up just like a young girl! I think He must be sending some message to Me through Subala.\u201d The purport is that the superiors of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b do not like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His cowherd friends to associate with Her; therefore these friends sometimes clothe themselves in female dress so they can give R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b a message from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this example the whole is conjugal love and the part is fraternity.",
            "The following is an example of a mixture of conjugal love and laughter in devotional service. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the dress of a young girl, told R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, \u201cOh, You hardhearted girl! Don\u2019t You know that I am Your sister? Why are You unable to recognize Me? Be merciful upon Me and please capture My shoulders and embrace Me with love!\u201d While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was dressed up exactly like R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b He was speaking these nice words, and \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b could understand His purpose. But because She was in front of many of Her superiors, She simply smiled and did not say anything. In this instance, the ecstasy of conjugal love is taken as the whole and the ecstasy of laughter is taken as the part.",
            "The following illustrates a mixture of several feelings. When one of the consort friends of Candr\u0101val\u012b saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was preparing to fight with the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101sura demon, she began to think, \u201cHow wonderful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is! His mind is captivated by the eyebrows of Candr\u0101val\u012b in a smiling spirit, His snakelike arms are on the shoulder of His friend, and at the same time He is roaring like a lion to encourage V\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101sura to fight with Him!\u201d This is an example of conjugal love, fraternity and chivalry. The conjugal love is taken here as the whole and the fraternity and chivalry are taken as the parts.",
            "When Kubj\u0101 caught hold of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s yellow garment because she was feeling almost lusty with sex urge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply bowed down His head with His cheeks glowing in front of the many people who were standing there and laughing. This is an example of a mixture of ecstatic conjugal love and laughter. The laughter is taken as the whole, and the conjugal love is taken as the part.",
            "Vi\u015b\u0101la, a cowherd boy who was attempting to fight with Bhadrasena, was addressed by another cowherd boy as follows: \u201cWhy are you attempting to show your chivalrous spirit before me? Before this, you even attempted to fight with \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, but you must know that \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 does not even care to fight with hundreds of Balar\u0101mas. So why are you acting so enthusiastically when you actually have no importance at all?\u201d This is an example of a mixture of devotional fraternity and chivalry. The chivalry is taken as the whole, and the fraternity is taken as the part.",
            "\u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was habituated to calling K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ill names, and by his insults he irritated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du more than he irritated K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas therefore equipped themselves with all kinds of weapons to kill \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. Their feelings were a mixture of ecstatic anger and fraternity, the anger being taken as the whole and fraternity as the part.",
            "Once K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was watching \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 very expertly using his stick to fight with Balar\u0101ma, who was an expert club fighter and who had even killed the Pralamb\u0101sura demon with His club. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saw Balar\u0101ma finally defeated by \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, who was using only a small stick, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became filled with pleasure and began to look upon \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 with great wonder. In this instance there is a mixture of astonishment, fraternity and chivalry in devotional service. The fraternity and chivalry are considered the parts and the astonishment is considered the whole.",
            "Expert analysts of these various kinds of mellows instruct us that when different mellows overlap one another, the mellow that is the whole, or the prominent humor, is called the permanent ecstasy. It is confirmed in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmottarathat when there are many mellows of devotional ecstasy mixed together, the prominent one, or the whole, is called the steady ecstasy of devotional service. Although the subordinate mellow may be manifested for a certain time, at length it will become merged into the prominent whole. Thus it is called an unconstitutional ecstasy of devotional service.",
            "There is a good analogy in this connection, showing the relationship between the part and whole. Lord V\u0101mana-deva is actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He appeared to have been \u201cborn\u201d as one of the brothers of Indra. Although V\u0101mana-deva is sometimes taken as a less important demigod, He is actually the maintainer of Indra, the king of the demigods. Thus, although sometimes V\u0101mana-deva is considered to be a subordinate demigod, His actual position is that of the supreme whole, the source of the entire demigod system. In the same way, arasawhich is actually prominent may sometimes appear to be manifested in a subordinate way, although its actual position is as the main or prominent loving feeling of a devotee.",
            "When an unconstitutional ecstasy of devotional service is manifested prominently at a certain time, it is still accepted as the part. If it is not very prominently manifested, it appears only slightly and merges quickly back into the whole. At such times of slight appearance, no consideration is given to it; when one is eating some palatable dishes, if one also eats a small blade of grass he will not taste it, nor will he care to distinguish what its taste is like."

            "As already described, if certain kinds of mellows become mixed and there is a joining of opposite mellows, then the situation is called incompatible. When one is eating sweet rice and something salty or sour is mixed in, the mixture is not very tasteful and it is called incompatible.",
            "An exemplary instance of incompatibility is a statement by an impersonalist who was lamenting aloud, \u201cI have been attached simply to the impersonal Brahman feature, and I have passed my days uselessly in practicing trance. I have not given any proper attention to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the source of the impersonal Brahman and who is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasures.\u201d In this statement there are traces of neutrality and conjugal love, and the resulting humor is incompatible.",
            "Sometimes it is found in places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana that a person with a slight devotional attitude of neutral love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may immediately and artificially try to attain to the platform of conjugal love. But because of the incompatibility of neutrality and conjugal love, the person is found to fall from the standard of devotional service.",
            "Incompatibility was expressed by a great devotee on the platform of neutrality when he sarcastically prayed, \u201cI am very anxious to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is many millions of times more affectionate than the Pit\u0101s [forefathers] in the Pit\u1e5bloka and who is always worshiped by the great demigods and sages. I am a little surprised, however, that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the husband of the goddess of fortune, His body is often marked with the nail pricks of ordinary society girls!\u201d Here is an example of incompatibility due to a mixture of neutrality and high conjugal love.",
            "There is the following statement by agop\u012b:\u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the first thing You should do is just embrace me with Your strong arms. Then, my dear friend, I shall first smell Your head, and then I shall enjoy with You.\u201d This is an example of incompatibility in which conjugal love is the whole and servitorship is the part.",
            "One devotee said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, how can I address You as my son when You are addressed by the great Ved\u0101ntists as the Absolute Truth and by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who follow the principles ofN\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101traas the Supreme Personality of Godhead? You are the same Supreme Person, so how shall my tongue be so extraordinarily bold as to address You as an ordinary son?\u201d In this statement there is a mixture of neutrality and parental love, and the result is incompatible.",
            "Another devotee said, \u201cMy dear friend, my youthful beauty is as temporary as lightning in the sky, and therefore my possessing attractive bodily features is unimportant. I have never met K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so I request you to please arrange for my meeting Him immediately.\u201d In this statement there is the incompatibility of a neutral mellow mixed with conjugal love.",
            "A lusty woman in Kail\u0101sa once told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, may You have a long life!\u201d Then, after saying this she embraced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is an example of incompatibility resulting from a mixture of parental love and conjugal love.",
            "The purpose of the above analysis is to show that in the mixture of various mellows, or reciprocations of ecstatic love between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the devotees, if the result is not pure there will be incompatibility. According to the opinion of stalwart devotees like R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, as soon as there are contradictory feelings, the result is incompatible.",
            "Once an ordinary female devotee addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear boy, I know that my body is just a composition of flesh and blood and can never be enjoyable to You. But still, I have been so attracted by Your beauty that I wish that You accept me as Your conjugal lover.\u201d In this statement there is incompatibility caused by a mixture of ghastliness and conjugal love in devotional service.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b warns devotees to not commit such incompatibilities in their writings or in their dealings. The presence of such contradictory feelings is calledras\u0101bh\u0101sa.When there isras\u0101bh\u0101sain any book of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no learned scholar or devotee will accept it.",
            "In theVidagdha-m\u0101dhava,second act, verse 17, Paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b tells N\u0101nd\u012bmukh\u012b, \u201cJust see how wonderful it is! Great sages meditate upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after being relieved from all material transactions, and with great difficulty they try to situate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in their hearts. And opposed to this, this young girl is trying to withdraw her mind from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that she can apply it in the material activities of sense gratification. What a regrettable thing it is that this girl is trying to drive away from her heart the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who is sought after by great sages through severe austerities and perseverance!\u201d Although in this statement there are contradictory mellows of ecstatic devotion, the result is not incompatible because the conjugal love is so elevated that it is defeating all other varieties of mellows. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments in this connection that such a loving state of mind is not possible for all. It is possible only in the case of thegop\u012bsof V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.",
            "There are many other instances of contradictory mellows where there is no perverted experience ofras\u0101bh\u0101sa.Once some minor demigod of the heavenly planets remarked, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose joking words were once the source of so much laughter for the residents of Vraja, has now been attacked by the serpent king, K\u0101liya, and He has become the object of everyone\u2019s overwhelming lamentation!\u201d In this instance there is a mixture of laughter and compassion, but there is no incompatibility, because by both of theserasasthe loving affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is increased.",
            "\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was once told that although She had stopped all activities, She was still the supreme source of inspiration for all kinds of devotional service. The statement says, \u201cMy dear R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, in separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a You are now as still as the most beautiful tree, whose gracefulness is not blocked by any covering of leaves. Your tranquil mood makes You appear to be completely merged in Brahman realization!\u201d In this example there is a mixture of conjugal love and neutral love, but the conjugal love has surpassed everything. Actually, Brahman realization is only a stunted existence. There is the following statement by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself: \u201c\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b has become peace personified for Me. Because of Her, I now go without sleep. I stare constantly without blinking My eyes, and I am always in a meditative mood. Because of Her I have even made My home in the cave of a mountain!\u201d This is an example of conjugal love mixed with neutral love, but there is no incompatibility.",
            "The following is a conversation consisting of questions put before Rambh\u0101, a celebrated beautiful woman, and her corresponding answers. Rambh\u0101 was asked, \u201cMy dear Rambh\u0101, who are you?\u201d She answered, \u201cI am peace personified.\u201d Question: \u201cThen why are you in the sky?\u201d Answer: \u201cI am in the sky to experience the Supreme Absolute Truth.\u201d Question: \u201cThen why are you staring?\u201d Answer: \u201cJust to look into the supreme beauty of the Absolute Truth.\u201d Question: \u201cThen why do you appear to be disturbed in mind?\u201d Answer: \u201cBecause Cupid is acting.\u201d In the above example also there is no perverted representation of mellows, because on the whole the ecstasy of conjugal love has exceeded the neutral position of devotional service.",
            "In the Tenth Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,sixtieth chapter, verse 45, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b said, \u201cMy dear husband, a woman who has no taste for the transcendental pleasure available from Your personal contact must be inclined to accept as her husband somebody who is externally a combination of mustache, beard, body hairs, fingernails and some head hair. And within him there are muscles, bones, blood, intestinal worms, stools, mucus, bile and similar things. Actually, such a husband is only a dead body, but due to not being attracted to Your transcendental form, a woman will have to accept this combination of stools and urine for her husband.\u201d This statement, which lists the ingredients of a material body, is not a perverted mellow in transcendental realization because it shows correct discrimination between matter and spirit.",
            "In theVidagdha-m\u0101dhava,second act, verse 31, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells His friend, \u201cMy dear friend, what a wonderful thing it is that since I have seen the beautiful lotus eyes of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, I have developed a tendency to spit on the moon and the lotus flower!\u201d This is an example of conjugal love mixed with ghastliness, but there is no incompatibility.",
            "The following is a statement that describes different mellows of devotional service: \u201cAlthough K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was invincible to any enemy, the cowherd boys of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana became almost blackish with astonishment upon seeing His wonderful royal garments and His fighting feats on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\u201d In this statement, although there is a mixture of chivalrous activities and dread in devotional service, there is no perverted reflection of mellows.",
            "One resident of Mathur\u0101 requested her father to bolt the doors and then go with her to the school of S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni to find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. She complained that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had completely stolen her mind. In this incident there is a mixture of conjugal love and parental love, but there is no incompatibility.",
            "Abrahm\u0101nand\u012b(impersonalist) expressed his desire as follows: \u201cWhen shall I be able to see that supreme absolute Personality of Godhead who is eternal bliss and knowledge and whose chest has become smeared with redku\u1e45kumapowder by touching the breast of Rukmi\u1e47\u012b?\u201d Here there is a mixture of conjugal love and neutrality. Although this is a contradiction of mellows, there is no incompatibility, because even abrahm\u0101nand\u012bwill become attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja told his wife, \u201cMy dear Ya\u015bod\u0101, although your son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is as delicate and soft as themallik\u0101flower, He has gone to kill the Ke\u015b\u012b demon, who is as strong as a mountain. Therefore I have become a little disturbed. But never mind. All auspiciousness to my son! I shall raise this hand, which is as strong as a pillar, and I shall kill the Ke\u015b\u012b demon just to give freedom from all anxieties to the inhabitants of Vraja-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala!\u201d In this statement there are two kinds of mellows: chivalry and dread. Both of them, however, improve the position of parental love, and therefore there is no incompatibility.",
            "In theLalita-m\u0101dhavaof \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b it is stated, \u201cAfter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrival in Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s arena, Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s priest looked at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with a detestful expression. The entire arena was filled with dread on the part of Ka\u1e41sa and his priest and restless expressions of pleasure on the cheeks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends. Frustration was felt by His envious rivals. The great sages meditated. Hot tears were in the eyes of Devak\u012b and other motherly ladies, and hairs stood on the bodies of the expert warriors. There was astonishment in the hearts of demigods such as Indra. The servants danced, and the restless eyes of all the young girls glanced about.\u201d In this statement there is a description of a combination of different mellows, but there is no incompatibility.",
            "A similar statement, which is free from incompatibility, is in theLalita-m\u0101dhava,wherein the author blesses all the readers of the book in the following manner: \u201cAlthough the Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to lift a mountain with a finger of His left hand, He is always humble and meek. He is always very kind to His loving devotees. He has frustrated Indra\u2019s attempt at vengeance by refusing him the sacrifice of Indra-yaj\u00f1a. He is the cause of all pleasure to all young girls. May He be ever compassionate upon you all!\u201d"

            "Perverted Expression of Mellows",
            "Ras\u0101bh\u0101sa,or incompatible mixtures of mellows, may be classified asuparasa(false expression),anurasa(imitation) andaparasa(perverted or misrepresented mellows).",
            "There is the following statement by an impersonalist who had just seen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cWhen a person has passed completely from all contamination of material existence, he relishes a transcendental bliss of being established in trance. But as soon as I saw You, the original Personality of Godhead, I experienced the same bliss.\u201d This perverted reflection of mellows is called\u015b\u0101nta-uparasa,or a perverted reflection of mixed impersonalism and personalism.",
            "There is another statement as follows: \u201cWherever I am glancing I simply see Your personality. Therefore I know that You are the uncontaminated Brahman effulgence, the supreme cause of all causes. I think that there is nothing but You in this cosmic manifestation.\u201d This is another example ofuparasa,or a perverted reflection of impersonalism and personalism.",
            "When Madhuma\u1e45gala, an intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was dancing before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a joking manner, no one was paying attention to him, and he jokingly said, \u201cMy dear Lord, please be merciful upon me. I am praying for Your mercy.\u201d This is an example ofuparasain fraternal affection and neutrality.",
            "Ka\u1e41sa once addressed his sister Devak\u012b as follows: \u201cMy dear sister, having seen your dear son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I think that He is so strong that He can kill even wrestlers as strong as the mountains. So I will have no more anxieties about Him even if He is engaged in a terrible fight.\u201d This is an instance ofuparasain a perverted reflection of parental love.",
            "In theLalita-m\u0101dhava,\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cThe wives of they\u0101j\u00f1ika-br\u0101hma\u1e47aswere all young girls, and they were attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same way as thegop\u012bsof V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Out of their attraction, they distributed food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Here the two devotional mellows are conjugal love and parental love, and the result is calleduparasain conjugal love.",
            "One of the friends of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b told Her, \u201cMy dear friend G\u0101ndharvik\u0101 [R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b], You were the most chaste girl in our village, but now You have divided Yourself and are partially chaste and partially unchaste. It is all due to Cupid\u2019s influence upon You after You saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and heard the sound of His flute.\u201d This is another example ofuparasacaused by divided interests in conjugal love.",
            "According to some expert learned scholars, the feelings between lover and beloved create perverted reflections of mellows in many ways.",
            "\u201cThegop\u012bshave become purified by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance, and as such, Cupid\u2019s influence is distinctly visible on their bodies.\u201d Although in the material sense the glancing of a boy at a girl is a kind of pollution, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a threw His transcendental glance at thegop\u012bsthey became purified. In other words, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth, any action by Him is transcendentally pure.",
            "After K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a chastised the K\u0101liya-n\u0101ga in the Yamun\u0101 River by dancing on his heads, the K\u0101liya-n\u0101ga\u2019s wives addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cDear cowherd boy, we are all only young wives of the K\u0101liya-n\u0101ga, so why do You agitate our minds by sounding Your flute?\u201d K\u0101liya\u2019s wives were flattering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He would spare their husband. Therefore this is an example ofuparasa,or false expression.",
            "One devotee said, \u201cMy dear Govinda, here is a nice flowery bush in Kail\u0101sa. I am a young girl, and You are a young poetic boy. After this, what more can I say? You just consider.\u201d This is an example ofuparasa,caused by impudence in conjugal love.",
            "When N\u0101rada Muni was passing through V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he came to the Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bra-vana forest and saw in one of the trees the famous parrot couple that always accompanies Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The couple was imitating some discussion they had heard upon the Ved\u0101nta philosophy and thus were seemingly arguing upon various philosophical points. Upon seeing this, N\u0101rada Muni was struck with wonder, and he began to stare without moving his eyelids. This is an example ofanurasa,or imitation.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was fleeing from the battlefield, from a distant place Jar\u0101sandha was watching Him with restless eyes and was feeling very proud. Being thus puffed up with his conquest, he was repeatedly laughing. This is an example ofaparasa.",
            "Everything in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called ecstatic devotional love, although it may be exhibited in different ways: sometimes in the right order and sometimes as a perverted reflection. According to the opinion of all expert devotees, anything that will arouse ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to be taken as an impetus for transcendental mellow.",
            "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study ofBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuby \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b."
