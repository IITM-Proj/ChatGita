            "Everyone Can See God",
            "The Vedic literature is unique among all the world\u2019s scriptures because it details a practical process by which anyone can purify his or her consciousness and see God face to face. In this lecture, delivered in Los Angeles on August 15, 1972, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains, \u201cOne must actually be very eager to see God.\u2026 One must be very serious and think, \u2019Yes, I have been informed about God. So if there is a God, I must see Him.\u2019\u2009\u201d",
            "tac chraddadh\u0101n\u0101 munayoj\u00f1\u0101na-vair\u0101gya-yuktay\u0101pa\u015byanty \u0101tmani c\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41bhakty\u0101 \u015bruta-g\u1e5bh\u012btay\u0101",
            "\u201cThe seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes the Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Vedic literature,Ved\u0101nta-\u015bruti.\u201d [\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam1.2.12]",
            "People sometimes ask, \u201cHave you seen God?\u201d or \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d Sometimes we meet these questions. So the answer is \u201cYes, I am seeing God. You can also see God; everyone can see God. But you must have the qualification.\u201d Suppose something is wrong with a motorcar; it is not running. Everyone is seeing it, but a mechanic sees it differently. He\u2019s qualified to see it with greater understanding. So he replaces some missing part, and immediately the car runs. But although for seeing a machine we require so much qualification, we want to see God without any qualification. Just see the folly! People are such rascals, they are such fools, that they want to see God with their imagined qualifications.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25:\u201cI am not exposed to everyone. My energy,yogam\u0101y\u0101,is covering Me from their vision.\u201d So how can you see God? But this rascaldom is going on\u00a0\u2013 this \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d \u201cHave you seen God?\u201d God has become just like a plaything, so that cheaters advertise some ordinary man by saying, \u201cHere is God. Here is an incarnation of God.\u201d",
            "Na m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25.Sinful rascals, fools, the lowest of mankind\u00a0\u2013 they inquire like that: \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d What qualification have you acquired by which you can see God? Here is the qualification:tac chraddadh\u0101n\u0101 munaya\u1e25.One must first of all be faithful (\u015braddadh\u0101na). One must actually be very much eager to see God. Not that one takes it as a frivolous thing\u00a0\u2013 \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d\u00a0\u2013 or as some magic. They think God is magic. No. One must be very serious and think, \u201cYes, I have been informed about God. So if there is a God, I must see Him.\u201d",
            "There is a story in this connection. It is very instructive, so try to hear. One professional reciter was publicly reciting the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and he was describing that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very highly decorated with all kinds of jewels when He goes to tend the cows in the forest. So, there was a thief in that meeting, and he thought, \u201cWhy not go to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and plunder this boy? He\u2019s in the forest with so many valuable jewels. I can go there and catch the child and take all the jewels.\u201d This was his intention. So he was serious. \u201cI must find that boy,\u201d he thought. \u201cThen in one night I shall become a millionaire.\u201d",
            "The thief\u2019s qualification was his feeling: \u201cImustsee K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! Imustsee K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d That anxiety, that eagerness, made it possible for him to actually see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in just the same way as theBh\u0101gavatamreader had described. Then the thief said, \u201cOh, You are such a nice boy, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He began to flatter Him; he thought that by flattering Him he would easily take all the jewels. Then he proposed his real business: \u201cMay I take some of these ornaments? You are so rich.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cMy mother will be angry! I cannot give them away.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing just like a child.",
            "So the thief became more and more eager for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to give Him the jewels, but by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association he was becoming purified. Then at last K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, \u201cAll right, you can take them.\u201d Then the thief became a devotee immediately, because by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association he had been completely purified. So somehow or other you should come in contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then you\u2019ll be purified.",
            "Thegop\u012bsare another example of great eagerness to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thegop\u012bscame to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being captivated by His beautiful features. They were young girls, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wassobeautiful. Actually they were lusty when they came to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so pure that they became first-class devotees. There is no comparison to thegop\u012bs\u2019devotion, because they loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with heart and soul. That is the qualification. They loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so much that they didn\u2019t care for family or reputation when they went out in the dead of night. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute was sounding, and they were all fleeing their homes. Their fathers, their brothers, their husbands all said, \u201cWhere are you going? Where are you going in this dead of night?\u201d But thegop\u012bsdidn\u2019t care. They neglected their children, their family, everything. Their only thought was, \u201cWe must go to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "This eagerness is required. We must be very, very eager to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Manygop\u012bswho were forcibly stopped from going to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lost their lives because of their great feelings of separation. So this eagerness is wanted; then you can see God. Whether you are lusty or a thief or a murderer or whatever it may be\u00a0\u2013 somehow or other you must develop this eagerness, this desire: \u201cImustsee K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be seen.",
            "The first thing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is looking for is how eager you are to see Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will respond. If you are actually eager to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 whether you are lusty, or you want to steal His ornaments, or some way or other you have become attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 then it is sure your efforts will be successful.",
            "But you must desire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aonly.In this connection, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has written a verse:",

He is standing on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 near the Ke\u015b\u012b-gh\u0101\u1e6da, and He is playing on His flute. He is so beautiful, especially during this full-moon night. If you have any intentions to enjoy in this material world with your children, husband, or other family members, then please do not go there.\u201dBha\u1e45g\u012b-traya:K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always stands in a three-curved way with His flute. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019stri-bha\u1e45gaform, bending in three places. So the onegop\u012bsays to the other, \u201cIf you think that you\u2019ll enjoy your life more in this material world, then do not go to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Do not go there.\u201d The idea is that if you once see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then you\u2019ll forget all this nonsensical materialistic enjoyment. That is seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he said,sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho \u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce:\u201cMy dear Lord, I don\u2019t want anything else.\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to get the kingdom of his father, and when he saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offered, \u201cNow, whatever benediction you want, you take.\u201d Dhruva said, \u201cMy dear Lord, I no longer have any desire.\u201d That is seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "So, if you\u2019re eager to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, regardless of whatever motive you have, somehow or other, due to your eagerness, you\u2019ll see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the only qualification.",

            "So, this eagerness is a very important thing, but it can be awakened only by the association of devotees. Therefore we are giving everyone a chance to invoke that eagerness; then you\u2019ll see God, face to face.",
            "This life is meant for seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not meant for becoming dogs and hogs. Unfortunately, the whole modern civilization is training people to become dogs and hogs. It is only this institution\u00a0\u2013 this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement\u00a0\u2013 that is teaching people how to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is so important.",

            "Devotee:Here is the first question: \u201cIt is said that the greatest strength of Hinduism is its catholicity, or breadth of outlook, but that this is also its greatest weakness in that there are very few religious observances that are obligatory for all, as in other religions. Is it necessary and possible to outline certain basic minimum observances for all Hindus?\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:As far as Vedic religion is concerned, it is not for the Hindus; it is for all living entities. That is the first thing to be understood.

Historically,san\u0101tana-dharmawas followed regularly in India, and Indians were called \u201cHindus\u201d by the Muslims. The Muslims saw that the Indians lived on the other side of the River Sind, and the Muslims pronouncedSindasHind.Therefore they called India \u201cHindustan\u201d and the people who lived there \u201cHindus.\u201d But the wordHinduhas no reference in the Vedic literature, nor does so-called Hindudharma.Now thatsan\u0101tana-dharma,or Vedicdharma,is being distorted, not being obeyed, not being carried out properly, it has come to be known as Hinduism.

We have to studysan\u0101tana-dharmaas it is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and other Vedic literatures; then we\u2019ll understand what Vedic religion is.

            "Unfortunately, the Indian people gave up the real religious system\u00a0\u2013san\u0101tana-dharma,orvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma\u00a0\u2013and accepted a hodgepodge thing called \u201cHinduism.\u201d Therefore there is trouble. Vedic religion meansvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma,the division of society into four social classes and four spiritual orders of life. The four social classes are thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as[priests and intellectuals], thek\u1e63atriyas[political leaders and military men], thevai\u015byas[merchants and farmers], and the\u015b\u016bdras[manual laborers].

            "Devotee:The next question is this: \u201cIn the Kali-yuga, the present age of quarrel,bhakti[devotional service to God] has been described as the most suitable path for God realization. Yet how is it that Ved\u0101ntic teachings, which stressj\u00f1\u0101na[knowledge, or intellectual speculation], are emphasized by noted savants?\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:The so-called Ved\u0101ntists are cheaters; they do not know whatved\u0101ntais. But people want to be cheated, and the cheaters are taking advantage of them. The wordvedameans \u201cknowledge,\u201d andantameans \u201cend.\u201d So the meaning ofved\u0101ntais \u201cthe ultimate knowledge,\u201d and theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrateaches this. (As\u016btrais an aphorism: in a few words, a big philosophy is given.) The first aphorism in theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraisath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101:\u201cNow, in the human form of life, one should inquire about Brahman, the Absolute Truth.\u201d So the study of theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrabegins when one is inquisitive about the Absolute Truth. And what is that Absolute Truth? That is answered in a nutshell in the second aphorism.Janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:\u201cBrahman is the origin of everything.\u201d So Brahman is God, the origin of everything. And allveda,or knowledge, culminates in Him. This is confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[15.15]:vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedyah.\u201cThe purpose of all theVedas,all books of knowledge, is to search out Me.\u201d",

He is indeed the perfect person. It may be argued that although we have accepted Him as a perfect person, there are many others who do not. But one should not think that this acceptance is whimsical: He is accepted as the perfect person on the evidence of many authorities. We do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as perfect simply on the basis of our whims or sentiments. No\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted as God by many Vedic authorities like Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of all Vedic literatures. The treasure house of knowledge is contained in theVedas,and their author, Vy\u0101sadeva, accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s spiritual master, N\u0101rada, also accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such. N\u0101rada\u2019s spiritual master, Brahm\u0101, accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only as the Supreme Person but the supreme controller as well\u00a0\u2013\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25:\u201cThe supreme controller is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "There is no one in the creation who can claim that he is not controlled. Everyone, regardless of how important or powerful, has a controller over his head. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, has no controller; therefore He is God. He is the controller of everyone, but there is no one superior to Him, no one to control Him; nor is there anyone equal to Him, no one to share His platform of absolute control. This may sound very strange, for there are many so-called Gods nowadays. Indeed, Gods have become very cheap, being especially imported from India. People in other countries are fortunate that Gods are not manufactured there, but in India Gods are manufactured practically every day. We often hear that God is coming to Los Angeles or New York and that people are gathering to receive Him, etc. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not the type of God who is created in a mystic factory. No. He was notmadeGod: HeisGod.",
            "We should know, then, on the basis of authority, that behind this gigantic material nature, the cosmic manifestation, there is God\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 and that He is accepted by all Vedic authorities. Acceptance of authority is not new for us; everyone accepts authority\u00a0\u2013 in some form or another. For education we go to a teacher or to a school or simply learn from our father and mother. They are all authorities, and our nature is to learn from them. In our childhood we asked, \u201cFather, what is this?\u201d and Father would say, \u201cThis is a pen,\u201d \u201cThese are spectacles,\u201d or \u201cThis is a table.\u201d In this way, from the very beginning of life a child learns from his father and mother. A good father and mother never cheat when their son inquires from them; they give exact and correct information. Similarly, if we get spiritual information from an authority, and if the authority is not a cheater, then our knowledge is perfect. However, if we attempt to reach conclusions by dint of our own speculative powers, we are subject to fall into error. The process of induction, by which one reasons from particular facts or individual cases and arrives at a general conclusion, is never a perfect process. Because we are limited and our experience is limited, the inductive process of acquiring knowledge will always remain imperfect.",
            "But if we receive information from the perfect source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if we repeat that information, then what we are speaking can also be accepted as perfect and authoritative. This process ofparampar\u0101,or disciplic succession, means hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or from authorities who have accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and repeating exactly what they have said. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends this process of knowledge:eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25.\u201cThis supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.\u201d [Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.2]",
            "Formerly, knowledge was passed down by great saintly kings, who were the authorities. In previous ages, however, these kings were\u1e5b\u1e63is\u00a0\u2013great learned scholars and devotees\u00a0\u2013 and because they were not ordinary men, the government which they headed worked very nicely. There are many instances in Vedic civilization of kings who attained perfection as devotees of God. For example, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to the forest to search out God, and by practice of severe penance and austerity he found God within six months.",
            "The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness process is also based on austerity, but it is not very difficult. There are restrictions governing eating and sex life (onlypras\u0101dam,food first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is taken, and sex is restricted to married life), and there are other regulations which facilitate and foster spiritual realization. It is not possible in these days to imitate Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, but by following certain basic Vedic principles, we can make advancement in spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As we advance, we become perfect in knowledge. What is the use of becoming a scientist or a philosopher if we cannot say what our next life will be? A realized student of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can very easily say what his next life is, what God is, what the living entity is, and what his relationship with God is. His knowledge is perfect because it is coming from perfect books of knowledge, such as theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.",
            "This, then, is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is very easy, and anyone can adopt it and make his life perfect. If someone says, \u201cI\u2019m not educated at all, and I cannot read books,\u201d he is still not disqualified. He can still perfect his life by simply chanting themah\u0101-mantra:Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given us a tongue and two ears, and we may be surprised to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is realized through the ears and tongue, not through the eyes. By hearing His message, we learn to control the tongue, and after the tongue is controlled, the other senses follow. Of all the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and difficult to control, but it can be controlled simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and tastingk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam,food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "We cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by sensual perception or by speculation. It is not possible, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so great that He is beyond our sensual range. But He can be understood by surrender. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore recommends this process:",

            "Unfortunately, our disease is that we are rebellious\u00a0\u2013 we automatically resist authority. Yet although we say that we don\u2019t want authority, nature is so strong that it forces authority upon us. We are forced to accept the authority of nature. What can be more pathetic than a man who claims to answer to no authority but who follows his senses blindly wherever they lead him? Our false claim to independence is simply foolishness. We are all under authority, yet we say that we don\u2019t want authority. This is calledm\u0101y\u0101,illusion. We do, however, have a certain independence\u00a0\u2013 we can choose to be under the authority of our senses or the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The best and ultimate authority is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for He is our eternal well-wisher, and He always speaks for our benefit. Since we have to accept some authority, why not accept His? Simply by hearing of His glories from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamand by chanting His names\u00a0\u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 we can swiftly perfect our lives.",

The fighting is going on, between Pakistan and India or between Vietnam and America or this and that. Mundane politics and diplomacy and philosophy\u00a0\u2013 this is not the process. The process is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Everyone has to understand this point, that we are not proprietors. The actual proprietor is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That\u2019s a fact. Take America, for example. Say two hundred years ago, the European immigrants were not the proprietors. Somebody else was the proprietor, and before that somebody else was the proprietor, or it was vacant land. But the actual proprietor is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

So what is the remedy for our disease? We are searching after peace, but we won\u2019t accept the very thing that will actually give us peace. This is our disease. Therefore, this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to awaken the dormant K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in everyone\u2019s heart. Just consider: four or five years ago, these Europeans and Americans had never even heard of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 so how are they now taking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so seriously? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is already there in everyone\u2019s heart. It simply has to be awakened.

So this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is simply meant for awakening that dormant love, by giving everyone the chance to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process.",

            "In February 1973, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da was invited to speak at an art gallery in Auckland, New Zealand. There he invited his listeners to contemplate the works of the supreme artist\u00a0\u2013 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cThe rose is created out of the energies of the Supreme Lord, but these energies are so subtle and so artistic that a nice flower can bloom overnight. So, Krsna is the greatest artist.\u201d",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for coming here and giving us a chance to speak about the supreme artist. TheVedasdescribe how great an artist K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is:na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyate na tat-sama\u015b c\u0101bhyadhika\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u015byate.Nobody can be found who is greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead or equal to Him, and although He is the greatest artist, He doesn\u2019t have to do anything personally.",
            "In this world everyone of us knows somebody lesser than us, somebody equal to us, and somebody greater than us. That is our experience. However great you may be, you will find somebody equal to you and somebody greater than you. But as far as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is concerned, great sages have concluded by research and experiment that nobody is equal to Him or greater than Him.",
            "God is so great that He has nothing to do, no duties He must perform (na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyate). Why?Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate:His energies are multifarious, and they are working automatically, according to His desire (sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca). Suppose you are an artist. To paint a picture of a very nice rose, you have to take your brush, mix your colors on the palate, and tax your brain to make the picture beautiful. But in a garden you can see not only one rose but many thousands of roses blooming. They have been very artistically \u201cpainted\u201d by nature.",
            "But we should go deeper into the matter. What is nature? Nature is a working instrument, that\u2019s all\u00a0\u2013 an energy. Without some energy working, how could the rose bloom so beautifully from the bud? There must be some energy working, and that energy is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. But it acts so subtly and swiftly that we cannot understand how it is working.",
            "The material energies seem to be working automatically, but actually there is a brain behind them. When you paint a picture, everyone can see that you are working. Similarly, the \u201cpainting\u201d of the actual rose is also worked out by several energies. Don\u2019t think that the rose has been created automatically. No. Nothing is created automatically. The rose is created out of the energies of the Supreme Lord, but these energies are so subtle and so artistic that a nice flower can bloom overnight.",
            "So, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the greatest artist. Nowadays, in the electronic age, a scientist just pushes a button and his machine works so perfectly. Or an airplane pilot simply pushes a button and a huge machine just like a small city flies in the sky. So if it is possible for ordinary men of this world to work so wonderfully simply by pushing some buttons, how much greater must be God\u2019s ability to work. How much more fertile His brain must be than ordinary artists\u2019 or scientists\u2019 brains. Simply by His desire\u00a0\u2013 \u201cLet there be creation!\u201d\u00a0\u2013 everything is immediately manifest. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the greatest artist.",

You have all seen a banyan tree. It grows from a small seed. This small seed has so much potency that if you sow it in a fertile place and water it, one day it will become a big banyan tree. Now, what are the potencies, what are the artistic and scientific arrangements, within that small seed that allow it to grow into a big banyan tree? Also, on that banyan tree there are many thousands of fruits, and within each fruit there are thousands of seeds, and each seed contains the potency of another tree. So where is the scientist who can create in that way? Where is the artist within this material world who can create a work of art as pleasing as a banyan tree? These inquiries should be made.",

You cannot manufacture a machine that automatically grows into a big banyan tree. So don\u2019t you think there must be a big artistic brain, a great scientific brain, behind nature? If you simply say, \u201cNature is working,\u201d that is not a sufficient explanation.",
            "The second aphorism of theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraisjanm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:\u201cThe Absolute Truth is He from whom everything is generated.\u201d We have to expand our vision from the small things to the great things.

It is flying toward the moon, and we are giving all credit to the scientists, and the scientists are challenging, \u201cWhat is God? Science is everything.\u201d",
            "But if you are intelligent you will compare the sputnik to the millions and trillions of planets and stars. Just on this tiny earth planet there are so many oceans, so many mountains, so many skyscrapers. But if you go above this planet a few million miles, it will look just like a small spot. You will see it as just a spot in the sky. And there are millions of planets floating in the sky like swabs of cotton. So if we give so much credit to the scientists who have manufactured a sputnik, how much more credit we should give to the person who has manufactured this universal arrangement.

Lord Brahm\u0101 confirms this in hisBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101[5.1]:\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25.\u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller.\u201d Here in this material world we have experience of many controllers. Every one of us is a controller. You are a controller; I am a controller. But above you there is another controller, and above him there is another controller, and so on. You may go on searching out controller after controller, and when you come to the supreme controller\u00a0\u2013 He who is not controlled by anyone but who controls everyone else\u00a0\u2013 that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is our definition of God: the supreme controller.",
            "Nowadays it has become a cheap business to see many \u201cGods.\u201d But you can test someone to see if he is God. If he is controlled by somebody else, he is not God. Only if he is the supreme controller should you accept him as God. That is the simple test for God.",
            "Now, another quality of God is that He is full of pleasure (\u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t). By nature the Supreme Absolute Person is\u0101nanda-maya,full of pleasure. Suppose you are an artist. You engage in artistic work just to get some pleasure. By painting a picture you enjoy somerasa,some pleasurable mellow. Otherwise, why would you work so hard? There must be some pleasure in painting.",
            "So, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a israso vai sa\u1e25,the reservoir of all pleasurable mellows. He issac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25,full of eternity, knowledge, and pleasure. (\u0100nandameans \u201cpleasure.\u201d) His pleasure potency is \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. You have seen pictures of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pleasure potency. As I have already explained, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has innumerable energies, and one of these is His pleasure potency, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b.",
            "So those who have developed love of God are enjoying transcendental pleasure at every moment by seeing the artistic work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. That is the position of a devotee. Therefore we request everyone to become a devotee, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, so that you will see the artistic work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere.",
            "Seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere is not difficult. For example, suppose you are thirsty and you drink some water. When you drink you feel so much pleasure. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all pleasure (raso vai sa\u1e25). So, that pleasure you feel by drinking water\u00a0\u2013 that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states this inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[7.8]:raso \u2019ham apsu kaunteya.\u201cI am the taste of water.\u201d For an ordinary person, who cannot fully appreciate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is giving the instruction that He is the taste of the water that quenches your thirst. If you simply try to understand that this taste is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, you become God conscious.",
            "So it is not very difficult to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. You simply require a little training. And if you readBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is\u2013understanding it the way it is stated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, without any rascaldom or false interpretation\u00a0\u2013 you will become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And if you become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, your life is successful. You will return to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti).",
            "There is no loss in becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, but the gain is very great. Therefore we request all of you to try to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. ReadBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is;you will find all the information you need to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Or, if you don\u2019t want to readBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,please chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. You will still become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",

            "Nonetheless, while there is no possibility of experimental knowledge about God, if one becomes advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he will realize God directly. For example, through realization I am firmly convinced of whatever I am saying here about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. I am not speaking blindly. Similarly, anyone can realize God.Svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25:Direct knowledge of God will be revealed to anyone who sticks to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person will actually understand, \u201cYes, there is a spiritual kingdom, where God resides, and I have to go there. I must prepare to go there.\u201d Before going to another country, one may hear so much about it, but when he actually goes there he understands everything directly. Similarly, if one takes up the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one day he\u2019ll understand God and the kingdom of God directly, and the whole problem of his life will be solved.",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a uses the wordsan\u0101tana\u1e25to describe that spiritual kingdom. The material nature has a beginning and an end, but the spiritual nature has no beginning and no end. How is that? We can understand by a simple example: Sometimes, when there is a snowfall, we see that the whole sky is covered by a cloud. But actually that cloud is covering only an insignificant part of the whole sky. Because we are very minute, however, when a cloud covers a few hundred miles of the sky, to us the sky looks completely covered. Similarly, this entire material manifestation (called themahat-tattva) is like a cloud covering an insignificant portion of the spiritual sky. And just as when the cloud clears we can see the bright, sunlit sky, so when we get clear of this covering of matter we can see the original, spiritual sky.",
            "Furthermore, just as a cloud has a beginning and an end, the material nature also has a beginning and an end, and our material body also has a beginning and an end. Our body simply exists for some time. It takes birth, grows, stays for some time, gives off some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. These are the six transformations of the body. Similarly, every material manifestation undergoes these six transformations. Thus at the end this whole material world will be vanquished.",
            "But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a assures us,paras tasm\u0101t tu bh\u0101vo \u2019nyo \u2019vyakto \u2019vyakt\u0101t san\u0101tana\u1e25:\u201cBeyond this destructible, cloudlike material nature, there is another, superior nature, which is eternal. It has no beginning and no end.\u201d Then He says,ya\u1e25 sa sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u na\u015byatsu na vina\u015byati:\u201cWhen this material manifestation is annihilated, that superior nature will remain.\u201d When a cloud in the sky is annihilated, the sky remains. Similarly, when the cloudlike material manifestation is annihilated, the spiritual sky remains. This is calledavyakto \u2019vyakt\u0101t.",
            "There are many volumes of Vedic literature containing information about the material sky and the spiritual sky. In the Second Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe find a description of the spiritual sky: what its nature is, what kind of people live there, what their features are\u00a0\u2013 everything. We even get information that in the spiritual sky there are spiritual airplanes. The living entities there are all liberated, and when they fly in their airplanes they look as beautiful as lightning.",
            "So, everything in the spiritual world is substantial and original. This material world is only an imitation. Whatever we see in this material world is all imitation, shadow. It is just like a cinematographic picture, in which we see only the shadow of the real thing.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[1.1.1] it is said,yatra tri-sargo \u2019m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101:\u201cThis material world is illusory.\u201d We have all seen a pretty mannequin of a girl in a shopkeeper\u2019s showcase. Every sane man knows that it is an imitation. But the so-called beautiful things in this material world are just like the beautiful \u201cgirl\u201d in the shopkeeper\u2019s window. Indeed, whatever beautiful thing we see here in this material world is simply an imitation of the real beauty in the spiritual world. As \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says,yat satyatay\u0101 mithy\u0101 sargo \u2019pi satyavat prat\u012byate:\u201cThe spiritual world is real, and the unreal, material manifestation only appears real.\u201d Something is real only if it will exist eternally. Reality cannot be vanquished. Similarly, real pleasure must be eternal. Since material pleasure is temporary, it is not actual, and those who seek real pleasure don\u2019t take part in this shadow pleasure. They strive for the real, eternal pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,ya\u1e25 sa sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u na\u015byatsu na vina\u015byati:\u201cWhen everything in the material world is annihilated, that spiritual nature will remain eternally.\u201d The aim of human life is to reach that spiritual sky. But people do not know the reality of the spiritual sky. TheBh\u0101gavatamsays,na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um:\u201cPeople do not know their self-interest. They do not know that human life is meant for understanding spiritual reality and preparing ourselves for being transferred to that reality. It is not meant for remaining here in the material world.\u201d The whole of Vedic literature instructs us like this.Tamasi m\u0101 jyotir gama\u1e25:\u201cDon\u2019t remain in the darkness; go to the light.\u201d This material world is darkness. We are artificially illuminating it with electric lights and fires and so many other things, but its nature is dark. The spiritual world, however, is not dark; it is full of light. Just as on the sun planet there is no possibility of darkness, so there is no possibility of darkness in the spiritual nature, because every planet there is self-illuminated.",
            "It is clearly stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Person. TheBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101describes this supreme abode as\u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa,a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss\u00a0\u2013 nothing there is material. That spiritual variegatedness is the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy.",
            "Although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies, He is present everywhere\u00a0\u2013 in both the material and the spiritual universes.

            "It is clearly stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that only bybhakti,or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas there is only one Supreme Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary portions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and They preside over innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety of names: Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, and so on. These plenary expansions are like the leaves of a tree, the main trunk of the tree being like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, dwelling in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His supreme abode, systematically and flawlessly conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) by the power of His all-pervasiveness.",
            "Now, if we are at all interested in reaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode, then we must practicebhakti-yoga.The wordbhaktimeans \u201cdevotional service,\u201d or, in other words, submission to the Supreme Lord.

But the body is sure to be vanquished, along with all its designations. When one gets another body, he gets other designations. Suppose in the present lifetime one is an American. The next body he gets may be Chinese. Therefore, since we are always changing our bodily designations, we should stop identifying them as our self. When one is determined to free himself of all these nonsensical designations, then he can attainbhakti.",

Also, we should be free from material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam). Usually one wants to serve God for some material purpose. Of course, that is also good. If someone goes to God for some material gain, he\u2019s far greater than the person who never goes to God. That is admitted inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[7.16]:",

Of course, weshouldtry to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but we should always remember that He is unlimited and that we can never fully understand Him. It is not possible for us to do this. Therefore, we have to accept whatever is presented to us in the revealed scriptures. TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,for example, is presented by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for our understanding. We should try to understand Him simply by hearing from books likeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The wordkarmameans \u201cwork with some fruitive result.\u201d If we want to practice purebhakti,we should work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness selflessly\u00a0\u2013 not just to get some profit out of it.",

            "There are millions of planets and stars within this universe, yet this entire universe is only a small particle within the total creation. There are many universes like ours, and, as mentioned before, the spiritual sky is three times as large as the total material creation. In other words, three fourths of the total manifestation is in the spiritual sky.",
            "We get information fromBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that on every spiritual planet in the spiritual sky there is an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

It is not stated that one can reach Him by philosophical speculation or mental concoction or some physical exercise. One can reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only by practicing devotion, without deviating to fruitive activities, philosophical speculation, or physical exercise. Only by unalloyed devotional service, without any admixture, can we reach the spiritual world.",
            "Now,Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101further says,yasy\u0101nta\u1e25-sth\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni yena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is such a great person that although situated in His own abode, He is still all-pervading, and everything is within Him. How can this be? The sun is located in one place, but the sun rays are distributed all over the universe. Similarly, although God is situated in His own abode in the spiritual sky, His energy is distributed everywhere. Also, He\u2019s not different from His energy, just as the sun and the sunshine are not different, in the sense that they are composed of the same illuminating substance. So, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distributes Himself everywhere by His energies, and when we become advanced in devotional service we can see Him everywhere, just as one can light a lamp anywhere by plugging it into the electric circuit.",
            "In hisBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,Lord Brahm\u0101 describes the qualifications we require to see God:prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti.Those who have developed love of God can constantly see God before them, twenty-four hours a day.

            "Therefore, the conclusion is that we can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere, but we have to develop the eyes to see Him. We can do that by the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When we see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when we approach Him in His spiritual abode, our life will be successful, our aims will be fulfilled, and we\u2019ll be happy and prosperous eternally."

            "During a lecture given in September 1968 in Seattle, Washington, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da says, \u201cCan anybody in this meeting say that he\u2019s not the servant of anybody or anything? No, because our constitutional position is to serve.\u201d Then he proposes an idea new to most of his listeners: \u201cIf you agree to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gradually you will realize that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also serving you.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da goes on to explain how by pleasing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the soul can enjoy unlimited happiness.",
            "In this material world, everyone is trying to search out happiness and get relief from misery. There are three kinds of miseries caused by our material condition:\u0101dhy\u0101tmika, \u0101dhibhautika,and\u0101dhidaivika. \u0100dhy\u0101tmikamiseries are those caused by the body and mind themselves. For example, when there is some disarrangement of the different functions of metabolism within the body, we get a fever or some pain. Another kind of\u0101dhy\u0101tmikamisery is caused by the mind. Suppose I lose someone who is dear to me. Then my mind will be disturbed. This is also suffering. So diseases of the body or mental disturbances are\u0101dhy\u0101tmikamiseries.",
            "Then there are\u0101dhibhautikamiseries, sufferings caused by other living entities. For example, human beings are sending millions of poor animals to the slaughterhouse daily. The animals cannot express themselves, but they are undergoing great suffering. And we also suffer miseries caused by other living entities.",
            "Finally, there are\u0101dhidaivikamiseries, those caused by higher authorities such as the demigods. There may be famine, earthquake, flood, pestilence\u00a0\u2013 so many things. These are\u0101dhidaivikasufferings.",
            "So we are always suffering one or more of these miseries. This material nature is constituted in such a way that we have to suffer; it is God\u2019s law. And we are trying to relieve the suffering by patchwork remedies. Everyone is trying to get relief from suffering; that is a fact. The whole struggle for existence is aimed at getting out of suffering.",
            "There are various kinds of remedies that we use to try to relieve our suffering. One remedy is offered by the modern scientists, one by the philosophers, another by the atheists, another by the theists, another by the fruitive workers. There are so many ideas. But according to the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, you can get free of all your sufferings if you simply change your consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That\u2019s all.",

We are trying to become the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25). Instead of wanting to become a lord, we want to become the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Now, people may say this is a slave mentality: \u201cWhy should I become a slave? I shall become the master.\u201d But they do not know that this consciousness\u00a0\u2013 \u201cI shall become the master\u201d\u00a0\u2013 is the cause of all their suffering. This has to be understood. In the name of becoming master of this material world, we have become the servants of our senses.",
            "We cannot avoid serving. Every one of us sitting in this meeting is a servant. These boys and girls who have taken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have agreed to become servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So their problem is solved. But others are thinking, \u201cWhy should I become a servant of God? I shall become the master.\u201d Actually, no one can become the master. And if someone tries to become the master, he simply becomes the servant of his senses. That\u2019s all. He becomes the servant of his lust, the servant of his avarice, the servant of his anger\u00a0\u2013 the servant ofsomany things.",
            "In a higher stage, one becomes the servant of humanity, the servant of society, the servant of his country. But the actual purpose is to become the master. That is the disease. The candidates for the presidency are presenting their different manifestos: \u201cI shall serve the country very nicely. Please give me your vote.\u201d But their real idea is somehow or other to become the master of the country. This is illusion.",
            "So, we should understand this important point of philosophy: Constitutionally we are servants. Nobody can say, \u201cI am free; I am the master.\u201d If someone thinks like that, he\u2019s in illusion. Can anybody in this meeting say that he\u2019s not the servant of anybody or anything? No, because our constitutional position is to serve.",
            "We may serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or we may serve our senses. But the difficulty is that by serving our senses we simply increase our misery. For the time being you may satisfy yourself by taking some intoxicant. And under the spell of the intoxicant you may think that you are nobody\u2019s servant, that you are free. But this idea is artificial. As soon as the hallucination is gone, again you see that you are a servant.",
            "So we are being forced to serve, but we don\u2019t wish to serve. What is the adjustment? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If you become the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, your aspiration to become the master is immediately achieved. For example, here we see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna. [\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da points to a painting of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord; Arjuna is a human being. But Arjuna loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a friend, and in response to Arjuna\u2019s friendly love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has become his chariot driver, his servant. Similarly, if we become reinstated in our transcendental loving relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, our aspiration for mastership will be fulfilled. If you agree to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gradually you will see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also serving you. This is a question of realization.",
            "So, if we want to get free of the service of this material world, the service of our senses, then we must direct our service toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b quotes a nice verse in hisBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhuconcerning the service of the senses:k\u0101m\u0101d\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 kati na katidh\u0101 p\u0101lit\u0101 durnide\u015b\u0101.Here a devotee is saying to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he has served his senses for a very long time (k\u0101m\u0101d\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 kati na katidh\u0101).K\u0101mameans \u201clust.\u201d He says, \u201cBy the dictation of my lust I have done what I should not have done.\u201d When someone is a slave, he\u2019s forced to do things he does not wish to do. He\u2019s forced. So, here the devotee is admitting that under the dictation of his lust he has done sinful things.",
            "Then someone may say to the devotee: \u201cAll right, you have served your senses. But now you are done serving them. Now everything is all right.\u201d But the difficulty is this:te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 j\u0101t\u0101 mayi na karu\u1e47\u0101 na trap\u0101 nopa\u015b\u0101nti\u1e25.The devotee says, \u201cI have served my senses so much, but I find they are not satisfied. That is my difficulty. My senses are not satisfied, nor am I satisfied, nor are my senses kind enough to give me relief, to give me pension from their service. That is my position. I had hoped that by serving my senses for many years they would have been satisfied. But no, they\u2019re not. They are still dictating to me.\u201d",
            "Here I may disclose something one of my students told me: In old age his mother is going to marry. And somebody else complained that his grandmother has also married. Just see: Fifty years old, seventy-five years old, and the senses are still so strong that they\u2019re dictating, \u201cYes, you must marry.\u201d Try to understand how strong the senses are. It is not simply young men who are servants of their senses. One may be seventy-five years old, eighty years old, or even at the point of death\u00a0\u2013 still one is the servant of the senses. The senses are never satisfied.",
            "So this is the material situation. We are servants of our senses, but by serving our senses we are not satisfied, nor are our senses satisfied, nor are they merciful to us. There is chaos!",
            "The best thing, therefore, is to become a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.66] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,",

            "You have served your senses in so many lives, life after life, in 8,400,000 species. The birds are serving their senses, the beasts are serving their senses, the human beings, the demigods\u00a0\u2013 everyone within this material world is after sense gratification. \u201cSo,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cjust surrender unto Me. Just agree to serve Me, and I will take charge of you. You will be free from the dictation of your senses.\u201d",
            "Because of the dictation of the senses, we are committing sinful activities life after life. Therefore we are in different grades of bodies. Don\u2019t think that every one of you is of the same standard. No. According to one\u2019s activities, one gets a certain type of body. And these different types of bodies afford one different grades of sense gratification. There is sense gratification in the hog\u2019s life also, but it is of a very low grade. The hog is so sensual that it does not hesitate to have sex with its mother, its sister, or its daughter. Even in human society there are people who don\u2019t care whether they have sex with their mother or sister. The senses are so strong.",
            "So, we should try to understand that serving the dictations of our senses is the cause of all our misery. The threefold miseries that we are suffering\u00a0\u2013 the miseries we are trying to get free of\u00a0\u2013 are due to this dictation of the senses. But if we become attracted to serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we will no longer be forced to follow the dictation of our senses. One name for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Madana-mohana, \u201cHe who conquers Cupid, or lust.\u201d If you transfer your love from your senses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you will be free from all misery. Immediately.",
            "So this endeavor to be the master\u00a0\u2013 \u201cI am the monarch of all I survey\u201d\u00a0\u2013 should be given up. Every one of us is constitutionally a servant. Now we are serving our senses, but we should direct this service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And when you serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gradually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reveals Himself to you as you become sincere. Then the reciprocation of service between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and you will be so nice. You can love Him as a friend or as a master or as a lover\u00a0\u2013 there are so many ways to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "So, you should try to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and you will see how much you are satisfied. There is no other way to become fully satisfied. Earning great amounts of money will never give you satisfaction. I once knew a gentleman in Calcutta who was earning six thousand dollars a month. He committed suicide. Why? That money could not give him satisfaction. He was trying to have something else.",
            "So my humble request to you all is that you try to understand this sublime benediction of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a you will gradually develop a transcendental loving attitude for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as soon as you begin to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all your troubles will be eradicated and you will feel complete satisfaction.",
            "Thank you very much. Are there any questions?",
            "Question:When we engage the material energy in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what happens to it? Does it become spiritualized?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:When a copper wire is in touch with electricity, it is no longer copper; it is electricity. Similarly, when you apply your energy to the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is no longer material energy; it is spiritual energy. So as soon as you engage yourself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you become free from the dictates of the material energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[14.26]:",

            "So, when you apply your energy in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, do not think that it remains material. Everything used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service is spiritual. For example, each day we distribute fruitpras\u0101dam[fruit that has been offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a]. Now, one may ask, \u201cWhy is this fruit different from ordinary fruit? It has been purchased at the market like any other fruit. We also eat fruit at home. What is the difference?\u201d No. Because we offer the fruit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it immediately becomes spiritual. The result? Just go on eatingk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam,and you will see how you are making progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Here is another example. If you drink a large quantity of milk, there may be some disorder in your bowels. If you go to a physician (at least, if you go to an \u0100yur-vedic physician), he\u2019ll offer you a medical preparation made with yogurt. And that yogurt with a little medicine in it will cure you. Now, yogurt is nothing but milk transformed. So, your disease was caused by milk, and it is also cured by milk. How is that? Because you are taking the medicine under the direction of a qualified physician. Similarly, if you engage the material energy in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, that same material energy which has been the cause of your bondage will bring you to the transcendental stage beyond all misery.",

            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Miniskirt, yes. [Laughs.] So, because in the material world the basic principle is sex, everyone is inviting, \u201cYes, come on, enjoy sex. Come on, enjoy sex.\u201d But no matter how you try to enjoy sex, you cannot be satisfied. That is certain, because sense gratification is not your real platform of enjoyment. You are a spirit soul, and unless you come to the spiritual platform you will never be satisfied by any sense gratification. You\u2019ll simply go on hankering after pleasure, but you will find no satisfaction.",
            "Therefore, Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says we are suffering insa\u1e41s\u0101ra-bi\u1e63\u0101nale. Sa\u1e41s\u0101raindicates our material demands for eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are just like fiery poison. Then he says, \u201cMy heart is burning from this poison, but I have not searched out the means of relief: the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. I have no attachment for this chanting, and therefore I have spoiled my life.\u201d",
            "Then he says,vrajendra-nandana jei \u015bac\u012b-suta hoilo sei.The chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was introduced by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, Vrajendra-nandana, in the form of Lord Caitanya, \u015aac\u012b-suta. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took the part of the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, the king of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called Vrajendra-nandana. And Lord Caitanya took the role of the son of mother \u015aac\u012b; so He is known as \u015aac\u012b-suta. The Supreme Lord takes pleasure when He is addressed with His devotee\u2019s name, with His energy\u2019s name. (His devotees are also His energy.) Although He has no father\u00a0\u2013 He is the father of everyone\u00a0\u2013 He accepts some devotee as His father when He appears on earth. When a pure devotee wants K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts the devotee as His parent.",
            "So Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that Vrajendra-nandana (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) has now appeared as \u015aac\u012b-suta (Lord Caitanya), and Balar\u0101ma (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s brother) has become Nit\u0101i. And what is Their business?D\u012bna-h\u012bna-jata chilo hari-n\u0101me uddh\u0101rilo:saving all kinds of wretched, sinful conditioned souls by teaching them the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this age, Kali-yuga, you cannot find a pious man or a saintly person. Everyone is addicted to sinful activities. But simply by distributing the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord Caitanya saved everyone, however fallen he might have been. \u201cCome on!\u201d He said. \u201cChant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be delivered.\u201d",
            "What is the evidence that Lord Caitanya saved even the most fallen?T\u0101ra s\u0101k\u1e63\u012b jag\u0101i m\u0101dh\u0101i.Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i were two brothers who engaged in all kinds of sinful affairs. They were born into a very highbr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, but by bad association they became sinful. Similarly, in the present age, although the people of the West are descending from \u0100ryan families, very nice families, by association they have become fallen. Their environment is full of illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. So Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i are specimens of the modern population, and Lord Caitanya delivered them simply by inducing them to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.",
            "So chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will actually deliver all fallen souls, without doubt. This is not bogus propaganda. Whatever his past life, anyone who takes to this chanting process will become saintly. He will become a pure, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person.",
            "Chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will purify our heart, our burning heart. Then we will understand, \u201cI am an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Ordinarily we can come to this understanding only after many, many births, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[7.19].Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate:\u201cAfter many, many births, when a person becomes a man of wisdom, he surrenders unto Me.\u201d Why?V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti:Because he knows that V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is everything. But that kind of great soul is very rare (sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25).",
            "But Lord Caitanya has made it easy to become such a great soul. How? Simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore at the end of his song Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says,h\u0101 h\u0101 prabhu nanda-suta v\u1e5b\u1e63abh\u0101nu-sut\u0101-juta koru\u1e47\u0101 karoho ei-b\u0101ro:\u201cMy dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You are now present before me with Your internal potency, Your pleasure potency, R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Please be merciful to me. Don\u2019t neglect me because I am so sinful. My past life is so black, but don\u2019t neglect me. Please accept me. Don\u2019t kick me away. I surrender unto You.\u201d",
            "So, all of us should follow in the footsteps of Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. The purificatory process is chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And as soon as our heart is purified, we will become completely convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord and that we are His eternal servants. We have forgotten this. We are serving, but instead of serving the Lord we are serving our senses. We have never become the master. We are not the masters of our senses; we are the servants of our senses. That is our position.",
            "So why not become the servant of the Supreme Lord instead of remaining the servant of your senses? Actually, you can become the master of your senses only when you become the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Otherwise, it is not possible. Eithergod\u0101saorgosv\u0101m\u012b:that is your choice. A person who is the servant of his senses is calledgod\u0101sa,and a person who is the master of his senses is calledgosv\u0101m\u012b.He controls his senses. When his tongue wants to eat something that is not offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he thinks, \u201cO tongue, you cannot taste this thing. It is notk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam[food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d In this way one becomes agosv\u0101m\u012b,a master of his senses.",
            "When a person does not allow his senses to do anything for sense gratification but acts only for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called devotional service.H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate:Devotional service means to engage your senses in satisfying the master of the senses. The supreme master of the senses is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Now we are trying to use our senses for our personal service. This is calledm\u0101y\u0101,illusion. But when we engage the same senses in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is perfection. We don\u2019t stop the activities of the senses, but we purify the senses by engaging them in the service of the Lord. This is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Thank you very much. Any questions?",
            "Devotee:\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da, how is it that Lord Jesus is called the son of God? If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is usually the son, how is Jesus\u2014",

Being a son is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s constitutional position; being the father is His constitutional position (aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101). But sometimes He voluntarily becomes a son to taste His devotee\u2019s fatherly or motherly love for Him.",
            "When a pure devotee prays, \u201cMy dear Lord, I want You for my son,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts his prayer. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b became K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s parents in this way. In a previous life they underwent severe austerities. They were married, but they had no sex. They were determined that unless they could get the Lord as their son they would not have a child. So they performed severe austerities for many thousands of years. Then the Lord appeared to them and asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d",
            "\u201cSir, we want a son like You.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow can you get a son like Me? I\u2019ll become your son!\u201d",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took the part of his chariot driver. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was actually the hero of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, but He gave that position to His devotee: \u201cArjuna, you become the hero. I shall be your charioteer.\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like a father who wants to see his son become more than himself. If the father has an M.A., he wants to see his son get a Ph.D. Then the father is satisfied. He\u2019ll not tolerate an outsider\u2019s becoming more than him, but he\u2019s glad if his son becomes more than him. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, wants to see His devotee become more than Himself. That is His pleasure.",

            "sth\u0101vara-ja\u1e45gama dekhe, n\u0101 dekhe t\u0101ra m\u016brtisarvatra haya nija i\u1e63\u1e6da-deva-sph\u016brti",
            "A pure devotee may see a tree, but he forgets the tree and sees the energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And as soon as he sees the energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, instead of seeing the tree he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Another example is the sun and the sunshine. As soon as you see the sunshine, you can immediately think of the sun. Is that not so? In the morning, as soon as you see the sunshine shining in your window, you can immediately remember the sun. You are confident the sun is there, because you know that without the sun there cannot be any sunshine. Similarly, whenever we see something, we should immediately think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with reference to that particular thing, because that thing is a manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. And because the energy is not different from the energetic, those who have understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a along with His energies do not see anything except K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore for them there is no material world. To a perfect devotee, everything is spiritual (sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma).",
            "So, we have to train our eyes to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. And this training is devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a process of purification:",
            "sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41tat-paratvena nirmalamh\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate",
            "As soon as we are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we give up our false designations, and our seeing, touching, smelling, and so on becomenirmala,or purified, by being engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then we can immediately see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. As long as our eyes are not purified we cannot see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but as soon as they are purified by the process of devotional service, we will see nothingbutK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "So, Cupid is one of the agents of the illusory, material energy, but if we are perfectly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, Cupid cannot pierce our heart with his arrows. It is not possible. A good example is Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. When Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was a young man, a nicely dressed young prostitute came to him in the middle of the night and revealed her desire to unite with him. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, \u201cYes, please sit down. I shall fulfill your desire, but just let me finish my chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Just see! It\u2019s the dead of night, and in front of Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura is a beautiful young girl proposing to have sex with him. But still he\u2019s steady, chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. But he never finished his chanting, so her plan was unsuccessful.",
            "So, Cupid cannot pierce our heart when we are fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There may be thousands of beautiful women before a devotee, but they cannot disturb him. He sees them as energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He thinks, \u201cThey are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s; they are meant for His enjoyment.\u201d",
            "A devotee\u2019s duty is to try to engage all beautiful women in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not to try to enjoy them. A devotee is not pierced by the arrows of Cupid, because he sees everything in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is real renunciation. He does not accept anything for his own sense gratification but engages everything and everyone in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Thank you very much."

This no-holds-barred interview exposes many current \u201creligious\u201d philosophies and practices. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da declares, \u201cThe man who says he\u2019s God\u00a0\u2013 he\u2019s rascal number one.\u201d",

            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:He is rascal number one. I say it publicly.",
            "Journalist:Could you explain, give me a little background on that, and why, because our readers\u2014",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:From his behavior I can understand he is rascal number one. I do not want to know about him, but what he has done makes it obvious. But the wonderful thing is that people in the Western countries are supposed to be so advanced\u00a0\u2013 how are they befooled by these rascals?",
            "Journalist:Well, I think that people are looking for something, and he comes along\u2014",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, but they want something very cheap\u00a0\u2013 that is their fault. Now, for our disciples, we don\u2019t give anything cheap. Our first condition is character\u00a0\u2013 moral character. You see? Unless one is strictly following moral principles, we don\u2019t initiate him, we don\u2019t allow him in this institution. And this so-calledguruhas been telling people, \u201cJust do whatever you like. You simply pay me thirty-five dollars, and I\u2019ll give you amantra.\u201d You see? So people want to be cheated, and so many cheaters come. People do not wish to undergo any discipline. They have got money, so they think, \u201cWe shall pay, and immediately we\u2019ll get whatever we want.\u201d",
            "Journalist:Instant heaven.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. That is their foolishness.",
            "Journalist:Let me ask you\u00a0\u2013 I have my opinion, but let me ask you\u00a0\u2013 why do you feel that the younger people today are turning more and more toward the Eastern-oriented religions?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Because your materialistic way of life no longer satisfies them. In America, especially, you have got enough for enjoyment. You have got enough food, enough women, enough wine, enough houses\u00a0\u2013 enough of everything. But still you have confusion and dissatisfaction\u00a0\u2013 more in your country than in India, which is said to be poverty-stricken. But you\u2019ll find in India that although they are poverty-stricken, they are continuing their old spiritual culture. So the people are not as disturbed. This shows that material advancement alone cannot give one satisfaction. If they really want satisfaction, people must take to spiritual life. That will make them happy. All these people\u00a0\u2013 they are in darkness. There is no hope. They do not know where they are going; they have no aim. But when you are spiritually situated, you know what you are doing and where you are going. Everything is clear.",
            "Journalist:In other words, you feel that the Western-oriented church\u00a0\u2013 whether it be a synagogue or a church or whatever\u00a0\u2013 has failed to present spiritual life. Would you say that their message is not relevant? Or is it that they have failed to present their message properly?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Take the Bible. It was spoken long, long ago to primitive people who were living in the desert. These people were not very advanced. So at that time, in the Old Testament, it was sufficient to say, \u201cThere is a God, and God created the world.\u201d That is a fact. But now people are scientifically advanced, and they want to know in detail how the creation has taken place. You see? Unfortunately, that detailed, scientific explanation is not there in the Bible. And the church can\u2019t give any more than that. Therefore people are not satisfied. Simply officially going to the church and offering prayers does not appeal to them.",
            "Besides that, the so-called religious leaders are not following even the most basic religious principles. For instance, in the Old Testament there are the Ten Commandments, and one commandment is \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d But killing is very prominent in the Christian world. The religious leaders are sanctioning slaughterhouses, and they have manufactured a theory that animals have no soul. \u201cGive the dog a bad name and hang it.\u201d",
            "So when we ask, \u201cWhy are you committing this sinful act of killing?\u201d the priests refuse to discuss the matter. Everyone is silent. That means they are deliberately disobeying the Ten Commandments. So where are the religious principles? It is plainly stated, \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d Why are they killing? How do you answer?",
            "Journalist:Are you asking me?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes.",
            "Journalist:Well, \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d is obviously an ethic \u2026 and it\u2019s timeless, and it\u2019s valid. But man is not really interested\u2014",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, that\u2019s right. They are not really interested in religion. It is simply show-bottle. If you do not follow the regulative principles, then where is your religion?",
            "Journalist:I\u2019m not arguing with you. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more. I\u2019m in total agreement. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d \u201cThou shalt worship no other gods before Me.\u201d \u201cThou shalt not covet thy neighbor\u2019s goods.\u201d \u201cThou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.\u201d \u2026 Those are beautiful\u2014",

            "Journalist:Very few.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:So how can they say they\u2019re religious? And without religion, human society is animal society.",
            "Journalist:All right, but let me ask you this. How does your interpretation differ from the basic Judeo-Christian ethic of the Ten Commandments?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:There is no difference. But as I have told you, none of them are strictlyfollowingthe Ten Commandments. So I simply say, \u201cPlease follow God\u2019s commandments.\u201d That is my message.",
            "Journalist:In other words, you\u2019re asking them to obey those principles.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. I don\u2019t say that Christians should become Hindu. I simply say, \u201cPlease obey your commandments.\u201d I\u2019ll make you a better Christian. That is my mission. I don\u2019t say, \u201cGod is not in your tradition\u00a0\u2013 God is only here in ours.\u201d I simply say, \u201cObey God.\u201d I don\u2019t say, \u201cYou have to accept that God\u2019s name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and no other.\u201d No. I say, \u201cPlease obey God. Please try to love God.\u201d",
            "Journalist:Let me put it this way. If your mission and the mission of the Western Judeo-Christian ethic are the same, again let me ask, Why is it that the younger people, or people in general, are disenchanted, are trying to go toward the Eastern-oriented religions? Why are they going toward the Eastern if both are the same?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Because Judaism and Christianity are not teaching thempractically.I am teaching thempractically.",
            "Journalist:In other words, you\u2019re teaching them what you feel is a practical, everyday method for attaining this fulfillment of man\u2019s spirit.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Love of Godhead is being taught both in the Bible and in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But today\u2019s religionists are not actually teaching how to love God. I am teaching people how to love God\u00a0\u2013 that is the difference. Therefore, young people are attracted.",
            "Journalist:All right. So the end is the same, but it\u2019s the method of getting there that\u2019s different?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:No\u00a0\u2013 the end is the same and the method is also the same. But these so-called religious leaders are not teaching people to follow the method. I am teaching them practically how to follow it.",
            "Journalist:Let me ask you something that we\u2019ve run into a great deal just recently. The biggest problem holding men and women back from love of God and following the Ten Commandments is the problem\u00a0\u2013 how should I put it?\u00a0\u2013 well, the sexual problem. Now, I\u2019m stating something that\u2019s obvious. We\u2019ve all gone through this.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, everyone.",
            "Journalist:And there is nothing in Western culture or religion that teaches or helps a young person to cope with this difficult problem. I went through it. We all have. Now do you, in your message, give the young people something to hang on to? And if so, what?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:I ask my disciples to get married. I don\u2019t allow this nonsense of boys living with girlfriends. No. \u201cYou must get yourself married and live like a gentleman.\u201d",
            "Journalist:Well, let me get a little more basic. How about when one is fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years old?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:One thing is that we teach our boys how to becomebrahmac\u0101r\u012b\u00a0\u2013how to live the life of celibacy, how to control their senses. In Vedic culture, marriage generally doesn\u2019t take place until the boy is about twenty-four or twenty-five and the girl is about sixteen or seventeen. And because they are experiencing the spiritual pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they are not simply interested in sex life. So we don\u2019t say, \u201cDon\u2019t mix with women,\u201d \u201cStop sex life.\u201d But we regulate everything under the higher principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this way everything goes nicely.",
            "Journalist:So your disciples don\u2019t just bite their tongue or their lip and say, \u201cI won\u2019t touch her (or him).\u201d There is a substitute?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, a higher taste. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And it is working: I\u2019m already teaching Western men and women how to control their sexual impulse. My disciples that you see here are all Americans. They are not imported from India.",
            "Journalist:One thing I want to know is what you think about people like this famousmantra-sellingguru,who turned me off and so many other people. My daughter was very involved in that kind of thing for awhile. She\u2019s terribly disillusioned.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:The psychology is that the Western people, especially youngsters, are hankering after spiritual life. Now, if somebody comes to me and says, \u201cSv\u0101m\u012bj\u012b, initiate me,\u201d I immediately say, \u201cYou have to follow these four principles\u00a0\u2013 no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication, and no illicit sex.\u201d Many go away. But thismantraseller\u00a0\u2013 he does not put any restrictions. That\u2019s just like a physician who says, \u201cYou can do whatever you like; you simply take my medicine and you\u2019ll be cured.\u201d That physician will be very popular.",
            "Journalist:Yes. He\u2019ll kill a lot of people, but he\u2019ll be very well liked.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. [Laughs.] And a real physician says, \u201cYou cannot do this. You cannot do that. You cannot eat this.\u201d This is a botheration for people. They want something very cheap. Therefore the cheaters come and cheat them. They take the opportunity\u00a0\u2013 because people want to be cheated.",

You just have to realize yourself\u00a0\u2013 you have simply forgotten. You take thismantra,and you\u2019ll become God. You\u2019ll become powerful. There is no need to control the senses. You can drink. You can have unrestricted sex life and whatever you like.\u201d",
            "People like this. \u201cOh, simply by fifteen minutes\u2019 meditation I shall become God, and I have to pay only thirty-five dollars.\u201d Many millions of people will be ready to do it. For Americans, thirty-five dollars is not very much. But multiplied by a million, it becomes thirty-five million dollars. [Laughs.]",
            "We cannot bluff like that. We say that if you actually want spiritual life, you have to follow the restrictions. The commandment is, \u201cYou shall not kill.\u201d So I shall not say, \u201cYes, you can kill\u00a0\u2013 the animal has no feeling, the animal has no soul.\u201d We cannot bluff in this way, you see.",

In India this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness philosophy has millions and millions of followers\u00a0\u2013 eighty percent of the population. If you ask any Indian he will be able to tell you so many things about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

We don\u2019t say, \u201cGive up your religion and come to us.\u201d We say, \u201cAt least follow your own principles. And then if you want to, study with us.\u201d Sometimes it happens that although students have received their M.A. degree, they go to foreign universities to study more. Why does it happen? They want more enlightenment. Similarly, any religious scripture you may follow will give you enlightenment. But if you find more in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, then why should you not accept it? If you are serious about God, why should you say, \u201cOh, I am Christian,\u201d \u201cI am Jewish,\u201d \u201cI cannot attend your meeting\u201d? Why should you say, \u201cOh, I cannot allow you to speak in my church\u201d? If I am speaking about God, what objection can you have?",

Similarly, no one within this material world wants to be unhappy. Everyone is trying to be very happy, but one is forced to accept unhappiness. In this material world, from time immemorial to the present moment, there have been occasional wars, world wars, even though people have devised various means to stop wars. When I was a young man there was the League of Nations. In 1920, after the First World War, different nations formed the League of Nations, just to arrange for peaceful living among themselves. No one wanted war, but again there was a forest fire\u00a0\u2013 the Second World War. Now they have devised the United Nations, but war is still going on\u00a0\u2013 the Vietnam War, the Pakistan War, and many others. So you may try your best to live very peacefully, but nature will not allow you. There must be war. And this warlike feeling is always going on, not only between nation and nation, but also between man and man, neighbor and neighbor\u00a0\u2013 even between husband and wife and father and son. This warlike feeling is going on. This is calledd\u0101v\u0101nala,a forest fire. No one goes to the forest to set fire, but automatically, by the friction of dried bamboo, sparks arise, and the forest catches fire. Similarly, although we do not want unhappiness, by our dealings we create enemies, and there is fighting and war. This is calledsa\u1e41s\u0101ra-d\u0101v\u0101nala.",

            "How does he deliver you? What is his means? Consider the same example. When there is a fire in the forest, you cannot send a fire brigade or go there yourself with bucketfuls of water to extinguish it. That is not possible. Then how will it be extinguished? You need water to extinguish fire, but where will the water come from\u00a0\u2013 from your bucket or your fire brigade? No, it must come from the sky. Only when there are torrents of rain from the sky will the blazing forest fire be extinguished. These rains from the sky do not depend on your scientific propaganda or manipulation. They depend on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. So the spiritual master is compared to a cloud. Just as there are torrents of rain from a cloud, so the spiritual master brings mercy from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A cloud takes water from the sea. It doesn\u2019t have its own water but takes water from the sea. Similarly, the spiritual master brings mercy from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just see the comparison. He has no mercy of his own, but he carries the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the qualification of the spiritual master.",
            "The spiritual master will never say, \u201cI am God\u00a0\u2013 I can give you mercy.\u201d No. That is not a spiritual master; that is a bogus pretender. The spiritual master will say, \u201cI am a servant of God; I have brought His mercy. Please take it and be satisfied.\u201d This is the spiritual master\u2019s business. He is just like a mailman. When a mailman delivers you some large amount of money, it is not his own money. The money is sent by someone else, but he honestly delivers it\u00a0\u2013 \u201cSir, here is your money. Take it.\u201d So you become very much satisfied with him, although it is not his money he is giving you.

Some spiritual masters are thinking of becoming assistants to thegop\u012bs,some are thinking of becoming assistants to the cowherd boys, some are thinking of becoming assistants to Nanda and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and some are thinking of becoming God\u2019s servants.

            "In the material world these spiritual varieties are merely reflected, just like trees on a riverbank. A tree is reflected in the water, but reflected how? Upside down. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world, but a perverted reflection. In the spiritual world there is love between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

But these are only reflections of the spiritual world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the good lover of the animals, the calves and cows. Just as here we love dogs and cats, there K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loves cows and calves. You have seen this in pictures of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So the propensity to love even an animal is there in the spiritual world. Otherwise, how can it be reflected? This world is simply a reflection. If in the reality there is nothing like that, how can it be reflected here? So everything is there in the spiritual world. But to understand that original propensity to love, you have to practice K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Here in this world we are experiencing frustration. Here we love\u00a0\u2013 a man loves a woman, or a woman loves a man\u00a0\u2013 but there is frustration. After some time they are divorced, because their love is a perverted reflection. There is no real love in this world. It is simply lust. Real love is in the spiritual world, between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Real love is there between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thegop\u012bs.Real love is there in the friendship between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His cowherd boys. Real love is there between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the cows and calves. Real love is there between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the trees, flowers, and water. In the spiritual world, everything is love. But within this material world, we are satisfied merely by the reflection of the things in the spiritual world. So, now that we have this opportunity of human life, let us understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u00a0\u2013 let us understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

In this way you\u2019ll learn how to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then your life will be successful. This is our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Thank you very much.",

            "Lecturing at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University in the summer of 1969, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da introduces a meditation system renowned for its extraordinary power and the fact that it can be easily practiced almost anywhere and at any time. \u201cIf you take up this simple process,\u201d he says, \u201cchanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma Hare Hare, you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform.\u201d He adds, \u201cNo other meditation is possible while you are walking on the street.\u201d",
            "My dear boys and girls, I thank you very much for attending this meeting. We are spreading this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement because there is a great need of this consciousness throughout the world. And the process is very easy\u00a0\u2013 that is the advantage.",
            "First of all, we must try to understand what the transcendental platform is. As far as our present condition is concerned, we are on various platforms. So we have to first of all stand on the transcendental platform; then there can be a question of transcendental meditation.",
            "In the third chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, you\u2019ll find an explanation of the various statuses of conditioned life. The first is the bodily conception of life (indriy\u0101\u1e47i par\u0101\u1e47y \u0101hu\u1e25). Everyone in this material world is under this bodily concept of life. Someone is thinking, \u201cI am Indian.\u201d You are thinking, \u201cI am American.\u201d Somebody\u2019s thinking, \u201cI am Russian.\u201d Somebody\u2019s thinking he is something else. So everyone is thinking, \u201cI am the body.\u201d",
            "This bodily standard of conditioned life is called the sensual platform, because as long as we have a bodily conception of life we think happiness means sense gratification. That\u2019s all. This bodily concept of life is very prominent at the present moment\u00a0\u2013 not only at the present moment, but since the creation of this material world. That is the disease: \u201cI am the body.\u201d",
            "\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamsays,yasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47ape tri-dh\u0101tuke:Thinking we are the body means we have a concept of ourself as a bag of skin and bones. The body is a bag of skin, bones, blood, urine, stool, and so many other nice things. So when we think, \u201cI am the body,\u201d we are actually thinking, \u201cI am a bag of bones and skin and stool and urine. That is my beauty; that is my everything.\u201d So this bodily concept of life is not very intelligent, and improvement of the body is not a right calculation of self-realization.",
            "Those who are too engrossed with the bodily concept of life are recommended to practice thedhy\u0101na-yogasystem, theyogaof meditation. That is mentioned in the\u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In the sixth chapter, verses 13 and 14, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains, \u201cOne should hold one\u2019s body, neck, and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.\u201d",
            "Earlier Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives preliminary instructions on how one should practice this transcendental meditation. One has to restrict sense gratification, especially sex. One has to select a very solitary place, a sacred place, and sit down alone. This meditation process is not practiced in a place like this, a big city, where many people are gathered. One must go to a solitary place and practice alone. And then you have to carefully select your sitting place, you have to sit in a certain way \u2026 There are so many things. Of course, those things cannot be explained within a few minutes. If you are very much interested, you\u2019ll find a full description inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,in the chapter called \u201cDhy\u0101na-yoga.\u201d",
            "So from the bodily concept of life one has to transcend, to the spiritual platform. That is the goal of any genuine process of self-realization. I began by saying that at first we are all thinking we are the body.Indriy\u0101\u1e47i par\u0101\u1e47y \u0101hu\u1e25.Then, one who has transcended the bodily concept of life comes to the platform of mind.Indriyebhya\u1e25 para\u1e41 mana\u1e25.The wordmana\u1e25means \u201cmind.\u201d Practically the whole population of the world is under the bodily concept of life, but above them are some people who are under the mental concept of life. They are thinking they are the mind. And a few people are on the intellectual platform:manasas tu par\u0101 buddhi\u1e25. Buddhi\u1e25means \u201cintelligence.\u201d And when you transcend the intellectual platform also, then you come to the spiritual platform. That is the first realization required.",
            "Before you practice transcendental meditation, you have to reach the transcendental platform. That transcendental platform is calledbrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25.Perhaps you have heard this word\u00a0\u2013 Brahman. The transcendentalist thinks, \u201cAha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi:I am not the body; I am not the mind; I am not the intelligence; I am spirit soul.\u201d This is the transcendental platform.",
            "We are talking of transcendental meditation. So, by transcending the bodily concept of life, transcending the mental concept of life, and transcending the intellectual concept of life, you come to the real, spiritual platform, which is called thebrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25stage. You cannot simply say some words\u00a0\u2013 \u201cNow I have realized Brahman.\u201d There are symptoms. Everything has symptoms, and how you can know if someone has realized transcendence, Brahman, is explained inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.54]:brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101.When one is on the transcendental platform, thebrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25stage, his symptom is that he\u2019s always joyful. There is no moroseness.",
            "And what doesjoyfulmean? That is also explained:na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati.Someone on the transcendental platform does not hanker after anything, nor does he lament. On the material platform we have two symptoms: hankering and lamenting. The things we do not possess we hanker after, and the things we have lost we lament for. These are the symptoms of the bodily concept of life.",
            "The whole material world is hankering after sex. That is the basic principle of hankering.Pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 striy\u0101 mithun\u012b-bh\u0101vam etam. Mithun\u012b-bh\u0101vammeans sex. Whether you look at the human society or the animal society or the bird society or the insect society, everywhere you will find that sex is very prominent. That is the materialistic way of life. A boy is hankering after a girl, a girl is hankering after a boy; a man is hankering after a woman, a woman is hankering after a man. This is going on.",
            "And as soon as the man and woman unite, the hard knot in the heart is tied.Tayor mitho h\u1e5bdaya-granthim \u0101hu\u1e25.They think, \u201cI am matter, this body. This body belongs to me. This woman or man belongs to me. This country belongs to me. This world belongs to me.\u201d That is the hard knot. Instead of transcending the bodily concept of life, they become still more implicated. The situation becomes very difficult. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that if you are at all interested in practicingyogaand meditation, in trying to rise to the transcendental platform, you must cease from sex.",
            "But in the present age that is not possible. So in our method, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we don\u2019t say, \u201cStop sex.\u201d We say, \u201cDon\u2019t have illicit sex.\u201d Of course, what to speak of transcendental life, giving up illicit sex is a requirement ofcivilizedlife. In every civilized society there is a system of marriage, and if there is sex outside of marriage, that is called illicit sex. That is never allowed for people in any civilized society, what to speak of those trying for transcendental life. Transcendental life must be purified of all mental and bodily concepts of self.",
            "But in this age of Kali, where everyone is disturbed, always full of anxieties, and where life is very short, people are generally not interested in any transcendental subject matter. They are interested only in the bodily concept of life. When one is always disturbed by so many anxieties, how can he ascend to the platform of transcendental realization? It is very difficult in this age. It was difficult even five thousand years ago, when Arjuna took instruction on meditation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Arjuna was a royal prince; he was very much advanced in so many ways. Yet on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra he said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is not possible for me to practice this transcendental meditation, thisdhy\u0101na-yogaprocess. I am a family man; I have come here to fight for my political interest. How can I practice this system, in which I have to go to a solitary place, I have to sit down, I have to cease from sex? It is not possible.\u201d Arjuna was so much more qualified than we are, yet he refused to practice this meditation process.",
            "So, reaching the transcendental platform by theha\u1e6dha-yogaordhy\u0101na-yogasystem is not at all possible in this age. And if somebody is trying to practice such so-called meditation, he is not actually practicing transcendental meditation. You cannot perform this transcendental meditation in the city. It is not possible. That is very clearly stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But you are living in the city, you are living with your family, you are living with your friends. It is not possible for you to go to the forest and find a secluded place. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says you must do this to practice transcendental meditation.",
            "So here, in this age, if you want to rise to the transcendental platform, then you must follow the recommendations of the Vedic literature:kalau tad dhari-k\u012brtan\u0101t.In this age, simply by chanting the holy name of God one can reach all perfection. We are not introducing this chanting system by our mental concoction, to make things very easy. No, Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu introduced this process of transcendental meditation five hundred years ago. Also, the Vedic literature recommends it, and it is practical. You have seen that my disciples, these boys and girls, immediately experience a transcendental feeling as soon as they begin chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If you practice, you will also see how you are rising to the transcendental platform. So chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is the easiest process of transcendental meditation.",
            "This transcendental sound vibration will immediately carry you to the transcendental platform, especially if you try to hear so that your mind is absorbed in the sound. This Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sound vibration is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute. Since God is absolute, there is no difference between God\u2019s name and God Himself. In the material world there is a difference between water and the wordwater,between a flower and the wordflower.But in the spiritual world, in the absolute world, there is no such difference. Therefore, as soon as you vibrate Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you immediately associate with the Supreme Lord and His energy.",
            "The wordHareindicates the energy of the Supreme Lord. Everything is being done by the energy of the Supreme Lord.Parasya brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 \u015bakti\u1e25.Just as the planets are a creation of the energy of the sun, so the whole material and spiritual manifestation is a creation of the energy of the Supreme Lord. So when we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we are praying to the energy of the Supreme Lord and to the Supreme Lord Himself: \u201cPlease pick me up. Please pick me up. I am in the bodily concept of life. I am in this material existence. I am suffering. Please pick me up to the spiritual platform, so that I will be happy.\u201d",
            "You haven\u2019t got to change your situation. If you are a student, remain a student. If you are a businessman, remain a businessman. Woman, man, black, white\u00a0\u2013 anyone can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is a simple process, and there is no charge. We are not saying, \u201cGive me so many dollars, and I shall give you this Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.\u201d No, we are distributing it publicly. You simply have to catch it up and try it. You\u2019ll very quickly come to the transcendental platform. When you hear the chanting, that is transcendental meditation.",
            "This process is recommended in all the scriptures of the Vedic literature, it was taught by Lord Caitanya and followed by His disciplic succession for the last five hundred years, and people are achieving good results from it today, not only in India but here also. If you try to understand what this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is, you\u2019ll understand how transcendental meditation is possible. We are not sentimentalists; we have many books:Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is,\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad.And we have our magazine,Back to Godhead.It is not that we are sentimentalists. We are backed up by high philosophical thought. But if you take up this simple process\u00a0\u2013 chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u00a0\u2013 you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform, even without reading so much philosophical literature. This Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantrais Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s gift to the conditioned souls of the present age, in accordance with the Vedic sanction.",
            "So our request is that you give it a try. Simply chant, at home or anywhere. There is no restriction: \u201cYou have to chant this Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantrain such-and-such a place, in such-and-such a condition.\u201d No.Niyamita\u1e25 smara\u1e47e na k\u0101la\u1e25.There is no restriction of time, circumstances, or atmosphere. Anywhere, at any time, you can meditate by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No other meditation is possible while you are walking on the street, butthismeditation is possible. You are working with your hands? You can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is so nice.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ais the perfect name for God. The Sanskrit wordk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ameans \u201call-attractive.\u201d Andr\u0101mameans \u201cthe supreme pleasure.\u201d So if God is not all-attractive and full of supreme pleasure, then what is the meaning of God? God must be the source of supreme pleasure; otherwise how could you be satisfied with Him? Your heart is hankering after so many pleasures. If God cannot satisfy you with all pleasures, then how can He be God? And He must also be all-attractive. If God is not attractive to every person, how can He be God? But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actuallyisall-attractive.",
            "So the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantrais not sectarian. Because we are chanting these three names\u00a0\u2013Hare, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,andR\u0101ma\u00a0\u2013someone may think, \u201cThese are Hindu names. Why should we chant these Hindu names?\u201d There are some sectarian people who may think like that. But Lord Caitanya says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you have some other bona fide name of God, you can chant that. But chant God\u2019s name.\u201d That is the instruction of this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. So do not think that this movement is trying to convert you from Christian to Hindu. Remain a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim. It doesn\u2019t matter. But if you really want to perfect your life, then try to develop your dormant love for God. That is the perfection of life.",

Now we are distributing our love among so many things. But when all this love is concentrated simply on God, that is the perfection of love. Our love is there, but because we have forgotten our relationship with God, we are directing our love toward dogs. That is our disease. We have to transfer our love from so many dogs to God. That is the perfection of life.",
            "So we are not teaching any particular type of religion. We are simply teaching that you should learn to love God. And this is possible by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra.",

            "We generally regardyogamerely as a form of physical exercise. But in the following lecture, delivered in February 1969 in Los Angeles, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da reveals the inner meaning and nature ofyogaas taught and practiced in India for centuries. He explains how expertyog\u012bscan\u00a0\u2013 by practicing austerities\u00a0\u2013 travel to any planet in the universe. But, he concludes, at the time of death the most successfulyog\u012bstransfer themselves to \u201cthe spiritual world and enter into the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, or the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet, and enjoy with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamyamano h\u1e5bdi nirudhya cam\u016brdhny \u0101dh\u0101y\u0101tmana\u1e25 pr\u0101\u1e47am\u0101sthito yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m",
            "\u201cThe yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself inyoga.\u201d [Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01018.12]",
            "There are different kinds of transcendentalists, oryog\u012bs:thej\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b,thedhy\u0101na-yog\u012b,and thebhakti-yog\u012b.All of them are eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world, because theyogasystem is meant for reestablishing our link with the Supreme Lord.",
            "Actually, we are eternally connected with the Supreme Lord, but somehow or other we are now entangled in material contamination. So the process is that we have to go back again. That linking process is calledyoga.",
            "The actual meaning of the wordyogais \u201cplus.\u201d Now, at the present moment, we are minus God, minus the Supreme. But when we make ourselves plus, or connected with God, then our human form of life is perfect.",
            "By the time death comes, we must reach that stage of perfection. As long as we are alive, we have to practice how to approach that point of perfection. And at the time of death, when we give up this material body, that perfection must be realized.Pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le manas\u0101calena. Pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101lemeans \u201cat the time of death.\u201d For instance, a student may prepare two years, three years, or four years in his college education, and the final test is his examination. If he passes the examination, then he gets his degree. Similarly, if we prepare for the examination of death and we pass the examination, then we are transferred to the spiritual world. All that we have learned in this life is examined at the time of death.",
            "So here in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is describing what we should do at the point of death, when we are giving up this present body.",
            "For thedhy\u0101na-yog\u012bsthe prescription is:sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamya mano h\u1e5bdi nirudhya ca.In the technical language of theyogasystem, this process is calledpraty\u0101h\u0101ra. Praty\u0101h\u0101rameans \u201cjust the opposite.\u201d For example, suppose my eyes are engaged in seeing worldly beauty. So I would have to refrain from enjoying that external beauty and instead engage in meditation to see the beauty within. That is calledpraty\u0101h\u0101ra.Similarly, I would have to hearo\u1e41k\u0101ra\u00a0\u2013the sound representation of the Lord\u00a0\u2013 from within. And in the same way, all the senses must be withdrawn from their external activities and engaged in meditation on God. That is the perfection ofdhy\u0101na-yoga:to concentrate the mind on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or God. The mind is very agitating. So it has to be fixed on the heart:mano h\u1e5bdi nirudhya.Then we have to transfer the life air to the top of the head:m\u016brdhny \u0101dh\u0101y\u0101tmana\u1e25 pr\u0101\u1e47am \u0101sthito yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m.That is the perfection ofyoga.",
            "A perfectdhy\u0101na-yog\u012bcan choose his own destination after death. There are innumerable material planets, and beyond the material planets is the spiritual world.Yog\u012bshave information about all the different planets. Where did they get this information? From the Vedic scriptures. For instance, before I came to your country, I got the description of your country from books. Similarly, we can get the descriptions of higher planets and the spiritual world from the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.",
            "Theyog\u012bknows everything, and he can transfer himself to any planet he likes. He does not require the help of any spaceship. The scientists have been trying to reach other planets for so many years with their spaceships, and they will go on trying for one hundred or one thousand years. But they\u2019ll never be successful. Rest assured. This is not the process to reach another planet. Maybe, by scientific progress, one man or two men can succeed, but that is not the general process. The general process is that if you want to transfer yourself to any better planet, then you have to practice thisdhy\u0101na-yogasystem\u00a0\u2013 or thej\u00f1\u0101nasystem. But not thebhaktisystem.",
            "Thebhaktisystem is not meant for attaining any material planet. Those who render devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, are not interested in any planet of this material world. Why? Because they know that regardless of what planet you elevate yourself to, the four principles of material existence will still be there. What are those principles? Birth, death, disease, and old age. You will find these on any planet you go to. On some higher planets your duration of life may be very, very much longer than on this earth, but still, death is there. Material life means birth, death, disease, and old age. And spiritual life means relief from these botherations. No more birth, no more death, no more ignorance, and no more misery. So those who are intelligent do not try to elevate themselves to any planet of this material world.",
            "Now the scientists are trying to reach the moon planet, but it is very difficult for them to gain entrance, because they do not have a suitable body. But if we enter into the higher planets by thisyogasystem, then we will get a body suitable for those planets. For every planet there is a suitable body. Otherwise, you cannot enter. For example, although we cannot live in the water with this body, we can live in the water with oxygen tanks\u00a0\u2013 for fifteen or sixteen hours. But the fish, the aquatic animals, have a suitable body\u00a0\u2013 they are living their whole life underwater. And of course, if you take the fish out of the water and put them on the land, they\u2019ll die instantly. So you see, even on this planet you have to have a suitable kind of body to live in a particular place. Similarly, if you want to enter into another planet, you have to prepare yourself by getting a particular type of body.",
            "In the higher planets, our year is equal to one day and night, and you live for ten thousand of such years. That is the description in the Vedic literature. So you get a very long duration of life undoubtedly. But then there is death. After ten thousand years, or twenty thousand years, or millions of years\u00a0\u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. It is all counted, and death is there. But you, the spirit soul, are not subject to death\u00a0\u2013 that is the beginning ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre:you are an eternal spirit soul.",
            "Why should you subject yourself to this birth and death? To ask this question is a sign of real intelligence. Those persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are very intelligent. They aren\u2019t interested in promotion to any planet where there is death, regardless of how long you live. They want a spiritual body, just like God\u2019s. God\u2019s body issac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25. Satmeans \u201ceternal,\u201dcitmeans \u201cfull of knowledge,\u201d and\u0101nandameans \u201cfull of pleasure.\u201d If we leave this body and transfer ourselves to the spiritual world\u00a0\u2013 to live with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself\u00a0\u2013 then we get a body similar to His:sac-cid-\u0101nanda\u00a0\u2013eternal, full of knowledge, and full of bliss. Those who are trying to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious have a different aim of life than those who are trying to promote themselves to any of the better planets in this material world.",
            "You are a very minute, spiritual particle within this body, and you are being sustained in thepr\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101yu,or life airs. Thedhy\u0101na-yogasystem\u00a0\u2013 the\u1e63a\u1e6d-cakrasystem\u00a0\u2013 aims to get the soul from its position in the heart to the topmost part of the head. And the perfection is when you can place yourself at the top of the head and, by rupturing this topmost part of the head, transfer yourself into the higher planets, as you like. Adhy\u0101na-yog\u012bcan transfer into any planet\u00a0\u2013 wherever he likes.",
            "So if you like\u00a0\u2013 just like you are inquisitive about the moon planet\u00a0\u2013 become ayog\u012band go there. Ayog\u012bthinks, \u201cOh, let me see what the moon planet is like. Then I shall transfer myself to higher planets.\u201d It is the same with ordinary travelers. They come to New York, then go to California, then go to Canada. Similarly, you can transfer yourself to so many planets by thisyogasystem. But anywhere you go, the same systems\u00a0\u2013 visa system and customs system\u00a0\u2013 are there. So a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not interested in these temporary planets. Life there may be of a long duration, but he is not interested.",

Those who are personalists do not imagine. They see the actual form of the Supreme Lord.

            "Those who are actualyog\u012bsdo not desire to enter any other planet in the material world, because they know that life there is temporary. That is intelligence. Those who are satisfied with temporary happiness, temporary life, and temporary facilities are not intelligent, according to theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m.I am permanent. I am eternal. Who wants nonpermanent existence? Nobody wants it.",
            "Suppose you are living in an apartment and the landlord asks you to vacate. You are sorry. But you\u2019ll not be sorry if you go to a better apartment. So this is our nature: Wherever we live, because we are permanent, we want a permanent residence. That is our inclination. We don\u2019t wish to die. Why? Because we are permanent. We don\u2019t want to be diseased. These are all artificial, external things\u00a0\u2013 disease, death, birth, miseries. They are external things.",
            "Just like sometimes you are attacked with fever. You are not meant for suffering from fever, but sometimes it comes upon you. So you have to take precautions to get out of it. Similarly, these four kinds of external afflictions\u00a0\u2013 birth, death, disease, and old age\u00a0\u2013 are due to this material body. If we can get out of this material body, we can get out of these afflictions.",
            "So for theyog\u012bwho is an impersonalist, the recommended process is vibrating this transcendental sound,o\u1e41,while leaving this body. Anyone who is able to quit this material body while uttering the transcendental soundo\u1e41,with full consciousness of the Supreme Lord, is sure to be transferred to the spiritual world.",
            "But those who are not personalists cannot enter into the spiritual planets. They remain outside. Just like the sunshine and the sun planet. The sunshine is not different from the sun disk. But still, the sunshine is not the sun disk. Similarly, those impersonalists who are transferred to the spiritual world remain in the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, which is called thebrahma-jyotir.Those who are not personalists are placed into thebrahma-jyotiras one of the minute particles.",
            "We are minute particles, spiritual sparks, and thebrahma-jyotiris full of such spiritual sparks. So you become one of the spiritual sparks. That is, you merge into the spiritual existence. You keep your individuality, but because you don\u2019t want any personal form, you are held there in the impersonalbrahma-jyotir.Just as the sunshine is small molecules, shining molecules\u00a0\u2013 those who are scientists know\u00a0\u2013 similarly, we are tiny particles, smaller than an atom. Our magnitude is one ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair. So that small particle remains in thebrahma-jyotir.",
            "The difficulty is that, as a living entity, I want enjoyment. Because I am not only simply existing. I have got bliss. I am composed of three spiritual qualities:sac-cid-\u0101nanda.I am eternal, and I am full of knowledge, and I am full of bliss. Those who enter into the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Lord can remain eternally with full knowledge that they are now merged with Brahman, or thebrahma-jyotir.But they cannot have eternal bliss, because that part is wanting.",
            "If you are confined in a room alone, you may read a book or think some thought, but still you cannot remain alone all the time, for all the years of your life. That is not possible. You\u2019ll find some association, some recreation. That is our nature. Similarly, if we merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Lord, then there is a chance of falling down again to this material world. That is stated in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[10.2.32]:",

If you are not trained in that way, then by impersonal endeavor you can enter into the spiritual kingdom, but there is the risk of falling down again\u00a0\u2013 because that loneliness will create some disturbance, and you\u2019ll try to have association. And because you have no association with the Supreme Lord, you\u2019ll have to come back and associate with this material world.",
            "So better that we know the nature of our constitutional position. Our constitutional position is that we want eternity, we want complete knowledge, and we want pleasure also. If we are kept alone, we cannot have pleasure. We\u2019ll feel uncomfortable, and for want of pleasure we\u2019ll accept any kind of material pleasure. That is the risk. But in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we\u2019ll have full pleasure. The highest pleasure of this material world is sex life, and that is also perverted\u00a0\u2013 so diseased. So even in the spiritual world there is sex pleasure in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But we should not think that this is something like sex life in the material world. No. But,janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:unless that sex life is there, it cannot be reflected here. It is simply a perverted reflection. The actual life is there, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

            "So the best thing is to train ourselves in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Then at the time of death it will be possible to transfer ourselves to the spiritual world and enter into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own planet, and enjoy with Him.",

            "Is the mind the ultimate reservoir of human resources? Or is there a greater source of knowledge beyond our minds? In the following lecture, recorded in February 1969 in Los Angeles, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains why the mind must be brought under the control of spiritual energy. His theme is based on the following famous verse from India\u2019s most widely read and respected scripture, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:",
            "bandhur \u0101tm\u0101tmanas tasyayen\u0101tmaiv\u0101tman\u0101 jita\u1e25an\u0101tmanas tu \u015batrutvevartet\u0101tmaiva \u015batru-vat",

            "The whole purpose of theyogasystem is to make the mind our friend. The mind in material contact is our enemy, just like the mind of a person in a drunken condition. InCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta[Madhya20.117] it is said,k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bhuli\u2019 se j\u012bva an\u0101di-bahirmukha ataeva m\u0101y\u0101 t\u0101re deya sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-du\u1e25kha:\u201cForgetting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the living entity has been attracted by the Lord\u2019s external feature from time immemorial. Therefore, the illusory energy [m\u0101y\u0101] gives him all kinds of misery in his material existence.\u201d I am a spiritual soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but as soon as my mind is contaminated I rebel, because I have a little independence. \u201cWhy shall I serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God?Iam God.\u201d When this idea is dictated from the mind, my whole situation turns. I come under a false impression, an illusion, and my whole life is spoiled. So, we are trying to conquer so many things\u00a0\u2013 empires and so on\u00a0\u2013 but if we fail to conquer our minds, then even if we conquer an empire we are failures. Our very mind will be our greatest enemy.",
            "The purpose of practicing eightfoldyogais to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the practice ofyogais simply a waste of time; it is simply for show. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one\u2019s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, and so on. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as the Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101). Realyogapractice entails meeting the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart and then following His dictation. For one who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.",

            "Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. When the mind is misled by the external energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one\u2019s mind is controlled through one of theyogasystems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one\u2019s mind is fixed on the superior nature, one has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme from within. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence\u00a0\u2013 distress and happiness, cold and heat, and so on.

And not only we but all the different kinds of living entities have forms. Wherefrom have they come? Wherefrom have these forms originated? These are very commonsense questions. If God is not a person, then how have His sons become persons? If my father is not a person, how have I become a person? If my father has no form, wherefrom did I get my form? Nonetheless, when people are frustrated, when they see that their bodily forms are troublesome, they develop an opposite conception of form, and they imagine that God must be formless. But theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101says no. God has a form, but His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25).Satmeans \u201ceternity,\u201dcitmeans \u201cknowledge,\u201d and\u0101nandameans \u201cpleasure.\u201d So God has a form, but His form is full of pleasure, full of knowledge, and eternal.",
            "Now, let\u2019s compare our body to God\u2019s. Our body is neither eternal nor full of pleasure nor full of knowledge. So our form is clearly different from God\u2019s. But as soon as we think of form, we think the form must be like ours. Therefore we think that since God must be the opposite of us, He must have no form. This is speculation, however, not knowledge. As it is said in thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25:\u201cOne cannot understand the form, name, quality, or paraphernalia of God with one\u2019s material senses.\u201d Our senses are imperfect, so how can we see the Supreme Person? It is not possible.",
            "Then how is it possible to see Him?Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau:If we train our senses, if we purify our senses, those purified senses will help us see God. It is just as if we had cataracts on our eyes. Because our eyes are suffering from cataracts, we cannot see. But this does not mean that there is nothing to be seen\u00a0\u2013 only thatwecannot see. Similarly, now we cannot conceive of the form of God, but if our cataracts are removed, we can see Him. TheBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101says,prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocane\u1e47a santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti:\u201cThe devotees whose eyes are anointed with the love-of-God ointment see God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, within their hearts twenty-four hours a day.\u201d So, we require to purify our senses. Then we\u2019ll be able to understand what the form of God is, what the name of God is, what the qualities of God are, what the abode of God is, and what the paraphernalia of God are, and we\u2019ll be able to see God in everything.",
            "The Vedic literature is full of references to God\u2019s form. For example, it is said that God has no hands or legs but that He can accept anything you offer:ap\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101.Also, it is said that God has no eyes or ears but that He can see everything and hear everything. So, these are apparent contradictions, because whenever we think of someone seeing, we think he must have eyes like ours. This is our material conception. Factually, however, God does have eyes, but His eyes are different from ours. He can see even in the darkness, but we cannot. God can hear, also. God is in His kingdom, which is millions and millions of miles away, but if we are whispering something\u00a0\u2013 conspiracy\u00a0\u2013 He can hear it, because He is sitting within us.",

We experience this daily: When we offer K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food according to the ritualistic process, we see that the taste of the food changes immediately. This is practical. So God eats, but because He is full in Himself, He does not eat like us. If someone offers me a plate of food, I may finish it, but God is not hungry, so when He eats He leaves the things as they are.P\u016br\u1e47asya p\u016br\u1e47am \u0101d\u0101ya p\u016br\u1e47am ev\u0101va\u015bi\u1e63yate:God is so full that He can eat all the food that we offer and still it remains as it is.

But if God simply sees the food we have offered, that is His eating.",
            "Of course, these things cannot be understood by us at the present moment. Therefore, thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47asays that only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him. We cannot understand God by our own endeavor, but God can reveal Himself to us. Trying to see God by our own efforts is just like trying to see the sun when it is dark outside. If we say, \u201cOh, I have a very strong flashlight, and I shall search out the sun,\u201d we will not be able to see it. But in the morning, when the sun rises out of its own will, we can see it. Similarly, we cannot see God by our own endeavor, because our senses are all imperfect. We have to purify our senses and wait for the time when God will be pleased to reveal Himself before us. This is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We cannot challenge, \u201cOh, my dear God, my dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You must come before me. I shall see You.\u201d No, God is not our order-supplier, our servant. When He is pleased with us, we\u2019ll see Him.",
            "So, ouryogaprocess tries to please God so that He will reveal Himself to us. That is the realyogaprocess. Without this process, people are accepting so many nonsensical \u201cGods.\u201d Because people cannot see God, anybody who says \u201cI am God\u201d is accepted. No one knows who God is. Somebody may say, \u201cI am searching after truth,\u201d but he must know what truth is. Otherwise, how will he search out truth? Suppose I want to purchase gold. I must know what gold is, or at least have some experience of it. Otherwise, people will cheat me. So, people are being cheated\u00a0\u2013 accepting so many rascals as God\u00a0\u2013 because they do not know what God is. Anyone can come and say, \u201cI am God,\u201d and some rascal will accept him as God. The man who says \u201cI am God\u201d is a rascal, and the man who accepts him as God is also a rascal. God cannot be known like this. One has to qualify himself to see God, to understand God. That is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25:If we engage ourselves in the service of the Lord, then we\u2019ll become qualified to see God. Otherwise, it is not possible.",
            "Now, thisBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. No one can become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious simply by mundane scholarship. Simply because one has some titles\u00a0\u2013 M.A., B.A., Ph.D.\u00a0\u2013 that does not mean he\u2019ll understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This is a transcendental science, and one requires different senses to understand it. So one has to purify his senses by rendering service to the Lord. Otherwise, even if one is a great scholar\u00a0\u2013 a doctor or a Ph.D.\u00a0\u2013 he will make mistakes in trying to find out what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. He will not understand\u00a0\u2013 it is not possible. This is why K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in the material world as He is. Although He is unborn (ajo \u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101), He comes to make us know who God is. But since He is not personally present now, to know Him one must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is satisfied with pure devotional service. So we have to acquire the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then we can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can talk with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0\u2013 then we can do everything.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is aperson.He is the supremeperson.That is the Vedic injunction:nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m\u00a0\u2013\u201cWe are all eternal persons, and God is the supreme eternal person.\u201d Now we are meeting birth and death because we are encaged within this body.

Then we will see God.",
            "Through realized knowledge one becomes perfect. Through transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but with mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And he is transcendental, because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him, mundane scholarship and mental speculation (which may be as good as gold to others) are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.",
            "Even if one is illiterate, even if he does not know the ABC\u2019s, he can realize God\u00a0\u2013 provided he engages himself in submissive transcendental loving service to God. On the other hand, although one is a very learned scholar, he may not be able to realize God. God is not subject to any material condition, because He is the supreme spirit. Similarly, the process of realizing God is also not subject to any material condition. It is not true that because one is a poor man he cannot realize God, or that because one is a very rich man he shall realize God. No. God is beyond our material conditions (apratihat\u0101). In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[1.2.6] it is said,sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje:\u201cThat religion is first class which helps one advance his devotional service and love of God.\u201d",
            "TheBh\u0101gavatamdoes not mention that the Hindu religion is first class or the Christian religion is first class or the Mohammedan religion is first class or some other religion is first class. TheBh\u0101gavatamsays that that religion is first class which helps one advance his devotional service and love of God. That\u2019s all. This is the definition of a first-class religion. We do not analyze that one religion is first class or that another religion is last class. Of course, there are three qualities in the material world (goodness, passion, and ignorance), and religious conceptions are created according to these qualities. But thepurposeof religion is to understand God and to learn how to love God.Anyreligious system, if it teaches one how to love God, is first class. Otherwise, it is useless. One may prosecute his religious principles very rigidly and very nicely, but if his love of God is nil, if his love of matter is simply enhanced, then his religion is no religion.",
            "In the same verse, theBh\u0101gavatamsays that real religion must beahaituk\u012bandapratihat\u0101:without selfish motivation and without any impediment. If we can practice such a system of religious principles, then we\u2019ll find that we are happy in all respects. Otherwise there is no possibility of happiness.Sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje.One of God\u2019s names is Adhok\u1e63aja.Adhok\u1e63ajameans \u201cone who conquers all materialistic attempts to be seen.\u201dAk\u1e63ajameans \u201cdirect perception by experimental knowledge,\u201d andadha\u1e25means \u201cunreachable.\u201d We cannot understand God by experimental knowledge. No. We have to learn of Him in a different way\u00a0\u2013 by submissive aural reception of transcendental sound and by the rendering of transcendental loving service. Then we can understand God.",
            "So, a religious principle is perfect if it teaches us how to develop our love for the Godhead. But our love must be without selfish motive. If I say, \u201cI love God because He supplies me very nice things for my sense gratification,\u201d that is not love. Real love is without any selfish motive (ahaituk\u012b). We must simply think, \u201cGod is great; God is my father. It is my duty to love Him.\u201d That\u2019s all.No exchange\u00a0\u2013\u201cOh, God gives me my daily bread; therefore I love God.\u201d No. God gives daily bread even to the animals\u00a0\u2013 the cats and dogs. God is the father of everyone, and He supplies food to everyone. So, appreciating God because He gives me bread\u00a0\u2013 that is not love. Love without motive. I must think, \u201cEven if God does not supply me daily bread, I\u2019ll love Him.\u201d This is real love.

Or You may never come before me, so that I become brokenhearted without seeing You. Still, I love You.\u201d This is pure love of God. When we come to this stage of loving God, then we\u2019ll find ourselves full of pleasure. Just as God is full of pleasure, we\u2019ll also be full of pleasure. This is perfection.",

According to ancient Vedic teachings, theyogasystem\u00a0\u2013 beginning withha\u1e6dha-yoga, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma(physical exercises and breath control), andkarma-yoga\u2013 culminates inbhakti-yoga,theyogaof devotion to the Personality of Godhead. \u201cIf one is fortunate enough to come to the point ofbhakti-yoga,it is to be understood that one has surpassed all otheryogas,\u201dsays \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da. \u201cAnd the test of one\u2019s mastery ofbhakti-yogais based on how much one is developing one\u2019s love for God.\u201d",
            "yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41mad-gaten\u0101ntar-\u0101tman\u0101\u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41sa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25",
            "\u201cAnd of allyog\u012bs,the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me\u00a0\u2013 he is the most intimately united with Me inyogaand is the highest of all. That is My opinion.\u201d [Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01016.47]",
            "Here it is clearly stated that out of all the different kinds ofyog\u012bs\u00a0\u2013thea\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yog\u012b,theha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b,thej\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b,thekarma-yog\u012b,and thebhakti-yog\u012b\u00a0\u2013thebhakti-yog\u012bis on the highest platform ofyoga.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly says, \u201cOf allyog\u012bs,the one with great faith who always abides in Me \u2026 is the most intimately united with Me inyogaand is the highest of all.\u201d Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking, the wordsin Memean \u201cin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In other words, if one wants to become a perfectyog\u012bon the highest platform, one should keep oneself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "In this regard, the wordbhajatein this verse is significant.Bhajatehas its root in the verbbhaj,which is used to indicate devotional service. The English wordworshipcannot be used in the same sense asbhaja. To worshipmeans \u201cto adore\u201d or \u201cto show respect and honor to a worthy one.\u201d But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and be called merely discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned.",
            "So, worship is very different from devotional service. Worship involves some selfish motive. We may worship some very big businessman because we know that if we please him, he may give us some business and we\u2019ll derive some profit. The worship of the demigods is like that. People often worship one of the demigods for some particular purpose, but this is condemned inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[7.20]:k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25\u00a0\u2013\u201cThose who have lost their sense and are bewildered by lust worship demigods with a selfish motive.\u201d",
            "Thus when we speak of worship, there is a selfish motive, but when we speak of devotional service, there is no motive except the desire to please the beloved. Devotional service is based on love. For example, when a mother renders service to her child, there is no personal motive: she serves only out of love. Everyone else may neglect the child, but the mother cannot, because she loves him. Similarly, when there is a question of service to God, there should be no question of a personal motive. That is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that is recommended in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[1.2.6] in the description of the first-class system of religious principles:sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje\u00a0\u2013\u201cThe first-class system of religious principles is that which enables one to develop one\u2019s God consciousness, or love of God.\u201d If one can develop one\u2019s love for God, one may follow any religious principle\u00a0\u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. But the test is how much one is developing one\u2019s love for God.",
            "But if one has some personal motive and thinks, \u201cBy practicing this system of religion, my material necessities will be fulfilled,\u201d that is not first-class religion. That is third-class religion. First-class religion is that by which one can develop one\u2019s love of God, and that love must be without any personal motive and without any impediment (ahaituky apratihat\u0101). That is first-class religion, as recommended here by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this final verse of the sixth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfection ofyoga,but even if one looks at it from a religious viewpoint it is first class\u00a0\u2013 because it is performed with no personal motive. My disciples are not serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He will supply them with this or that. There may be this or that, but that doesn\u2019t matter. Of course, there is no scarcity; devotees get everything they need. We shouldn\u2019t think that by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious one becomes poor. No. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is there, everything is there, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aiseverything. But we shouldn\u2019t make any business with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, give me this, give me that.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows what we require better than we do, just as a father knows the necessities of his child. Why should we ask? Since God is all-powerful, He knows our wants and He knows our necessities. This is confirmed in theVedas: eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n\u00a0\u2013\u201cGod is supplying all the necessities of the innumerable living entities.\u201d",
            "We should simply try to love God, without demanding anything. Our needs will be supplied. Even the cats and dogs are getting their necessities. They don\u2019t go to church and ask God for anything, but they are getting their necessities. So why should a devotee not get his necessities? If the cats and dogs can get their necessities of life without demanding anything from God, why should we demand from God, \u201cGive me this, give me that\u201d? No. We should simply try to love Him and serve Him. That will fulfill everything, and that is the highest platform ofyoga.",
            "Service to God is natural; since I am part and parcel of God, my natural duty is to serve Him. The example of the finger and the body is appropriate. The finger is part and parcel of the body. And what is the duty of the finger? To serve the whole body, that\u2019s all. If you are feeling some itch, immediately your finger is working. If you want to see, your eyes immediately work. If you want to go somewhere, your legs immediately take you there. So, the bodily parts and limbs are helping the whole body.",
            "Similarly, we are all part and parcel of God, and we are all meant simply for rendering service to Him. When the limbs of the body serve the whole body, the energy automatically comes to the limbs. Similarly, when we serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we get all our necessities automatically.Yath\u0101 taror m\u016bla-ni\u1e63ecanena.If one pours water on the root of a tree, the energy is immediately supplied to the leaves, the twigs, the branches, and so on. Similarly, simply by serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, we serve all other parts of creation. There is no question of serving each living entity separately.",
            "Another point is that by serving God, we will automatically have sympathy for all living beings\u00a0\u2013 not only for human beings, but even for animals. Therefore God consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the perfection of religion. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness our sympathy for other living entities is very limited, but with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness our sympathy for other living entities is full.",
            "Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down.\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[11.5.3] confirms this as follows:",
            "ya e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d\u0101tma-prabhavam \u012b\u015bvaramna bhajanty avaj\u0101nantisth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25",
            "\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.\u201d",
            "How do we fall down from our constitutional position? Once again, the example of the finger and the body is appropriate. If one\u2019s finger becomes diseased and cannot render service to the whole body, it simply gives one pain. Similarly, any person who is not rendering service to the Supreme Lord is simply disturbing Him, giving Him pain and trouble. Therefore, such a person has to suffer, just like a man who is not abiding by the laws of the state. Such a criminal simply gives pain to the government, and he\u2019s liable to be punished. He may think, \u201cI\u2019m a very good man,\u201d but because he\u2019s violating the laws of the state, he\u2019s simply torturing the government. This is easy to understand.",
            "So, any living entity who is not serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is causing Him a kind of pain. And that is sinful\u00a0\u2013 to make K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a feel pain. Just as the government collects all the painful citizens and keeps them in the prison house\u00a0\u2013 \u201cYou criminals must live here so you can\u2019t disturb people in the open state\u201d\u00a0\u2013 so God puts all the criminals who have violated His laws, who have simply given Him pain, into this material world.Sth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25:They fall down from their constitutional position in the spiritual world. Again we may cite the example of the finger. If your finger is extremely painful, the doctor may advise, \u201cMr. So-and-so, your finger has to be amputated. Otherwise, it will pollute your whole body.\u201dSth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25:The finger then falls down from its constitutional position as part of the body.",
            "Having rebelled against the principles of God consciousness, we have all fallen down to this material world. If we want to revive our original position, we must again establish ourselves in the service attitude. That is the perfect cure. Otherwise, we shall suffer pain, and God will be suffering pain on account of us. We are just like bad sons of God. If a son is not good, he suffers, and the father suffers along with the son. Similarly, when we are suffering, God is also suffering. Therefore, the best thing is to revive our original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engage in the service of the Lord.",
            "The wordavaj\u0101nantiused in the verse cited from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis also used by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[9.11]:",

            "\u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The wordm\u016b\u1e0dhameans \u201cfool\u201d or \u201crascal.\u201d Only a rascal does not care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not knowing that he will suffer for this attitude, he dares neglect Him. Without knowing the supreme position of the Lord, the rascals worship some cheap \u201cGod.\u201d God has become so cheap that many people say, \u201cI am God, you are God.\u201d But what is the meaning of the wordGod? If everyone is God, then what is the meaning of God?",
            "So, the wordavaj\u0101nantiis very appropriate.Avaj\u0101nantimeans \u201cneglectful,\u201d and it perfectly describes the person who says, \u201cWhat is God? I am God. Why should I serve God?\u201d This isavaj\u0101nanti\u00a0\u2013neglecting God\u2019s real position. A criminal may have the same attitude toward the government: \u201cOh, what is the government? I can do whatever I like. I don\u2019t care for the government.\u201d This isavaj\u0101nanti.But even if we say, \u201cI don\u2019t care for the government,\u201d the police department is there. It will give us pain; it will punish us. Similarly, even if we don\u2019t care for God, the material nature will punish us with birth, old age, disease, and death. To get out of this suffering, we must practiceyoga.",
            "The culmination of all kinds ofyogapractice lies inbhakti-yoga.All otheryogasare but means to come to the point ofbhakti-yoga. Yogaactuallymeans bhakti-yoga;all otheryogasare progressions toward this destination. From the beginning ofkarma-yogato the end ofbhakti-yogais a long way to self-realization.Karma-yoga,executed without fruitive desires, is the beginning of this path. (Fruitive activities, orkarma,include sinful activities also.Karma-yoga,however, does not include sinful activities but only good, pious activities, or prescribed activities. This iskarma-yoga.) Then, whenkarma-yogaincreases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is calledj\u00f1\u0101na-yoga.Whenj\u00f1\u0101na-yogaincreases in meditation on the Supersoul by various physical processes, and when the mind is on Him, one has reached the stage calleda\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga.And when one surpassesa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogaand comes to the point of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one has reachedbhakti-yoga,the culmination.",
            "Factually,bhakti-yogais the ultimate goal, but to analyzebhakti-yogaminutely one has to understand these other, minoryogas.Theyog\u012bwho is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal auspiciousness, whereas one who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name:karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b,ora\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yog\u012b.But if one is fortunate enough to come to the point ofbhakti-yoga,it is to be understood that one has surpassed all the otheryogas.Therefore, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage ofyoga,just as, when we speak of the Him\u0101layas, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered the culmination.",
            "If someone practicingj\u00f1\u0101na-yogathinks that he is finished, that is wrong. He has to make further progress. For example, suppose you want to go to the highest floor of a building\u00a0\u2013 say, the hundredth floor\u00a0\u2013 by walking up a staircase. You will pass the thirtieth floor, the fiftieth floor, the eightieth floor, and so on. But suppose when you come to the fiftieth or eightieth floor you think, \u201cI have reached my goal.\u201d Then you are unsuccessful. To reach your destination you have to go to the hundredth floor. Similarly, all the processes ofyogaare connected, like a staircase, but we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied to stop on the fiftieth floor or the eightieth floor. We should go to the highest platform, the hundredth floor\u00a0\u2013 pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "Now, if somebody who wants to reach the hundredth floor is given a chance to use the elevator, within a minute he will be able to come to the top. Of course, he may still say, \u201cWhy should I take advantage of this elevator? I shall go step by step.\u201d He can do this, but there is a chance he will not reach the top floor. Similarly, if one takes help from the \u201celevator\u201d ofbhakti-yoga,within a short time he can reach the \u201chundredth floor\u201d\u00a0\u2013 the perfection ofyoga,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct process. You may go step by step, following all the otheryogasystems, or you may take directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Lord Caitanya has recommended that in this age, since people are very short-lived, disturbed, and full of anxiety, they should take up the direct process. And by His grace, by His causeless mercy, He has given us the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra,which lifts us immediately to the platform ofbhakti-yoga.It is immediate; we don\u2019t have to wait. That is the special gift of Lord Caitanya.

Therefore He is the most munificent incarnation. This is the position of Lord Caitanya.",
            "The only way to know God in truth is throughbhakti-yoga.InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.55] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this.Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25:\u201cOnly by devotional service can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is.\u201d TheVedasconfirm that only throughbhakti,or devotional service, can one attain the highest perfectional stage. If one practices otheryogasystems, there must be a mixture ofbhaktiif one is to make any progress. But because people don\u2019t have sufficient time to execute all the practices of any otheryogasystem, the direct process ofbhakti-yoga,unadulterated devotion, is recommended for this age. Therefore, it is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the path ofbhakti-yoga,and becomes well situated according to the Vedic directions.",

Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called thebrahma-jyotir.He incarnates in different forms, such as R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            "December 1969: Speaking in Boston before the International Student Society, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da provides a practical, simple, yet profound solution for world peace and harmony. Noting the increasing number of flags at the United Nations building in New York, he states that internationalism is failing because \u201cyour international feeling and my international feeling are overlapping and conflicting. We have to find the proper center for our loving feelings. \u2026 That center is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "Thank you very much for participating with us in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. I understand that this society is known as the International Student Society. There are many other international societies, such as the United Nations. So the idea of an international society is very nice, but we must try to understand what the central idea of an international society should be.",
            "If you throw a stone into the middle of a pool of water, a circle will expand to the limit of the bank. Similarly, radio waves expand in a circle, and when you capture the waves with your radio you can hear the message. In the same way, our loving feeling can also expand.",
            "At the beginning of our life, we simply want to eat. Whatever a small child grabs, he wants to eat. He has only personal interest. Then, when the child grows a little, he tries to participate with his brothers and sisters: \u201cAll right. You also take a little.\u201d This is an increase in the feeling of fellowship. Then, as he grows up, he begins to feel some love for his parents, then for his community, then for his country, and at last for all nations. But unless the center is right, that expansion of feeling\u00a0\u2013 even if it is national or international\u00a0\u2013 is not perfect.",
            "For example, the meaning of the wordnationalis \u201cone who has taken birth in a particular country.\u201d You feel for other Americans because they are born in this country. You may even sacrifice your life for your countrymen. But there is a defect: If the definition ofnationalis \u201cone who is born in a particular country,\u201d then why are the animals born in America not considered Americans? The problem is that we are not expanding our feelings beyond the human society. Because we don\u2019t think animals are our countrymen, we send them to the slaughterhouse.",
            "So the center of our national feeling or our international feeling is not fixed on the proper object. If the center is right, then you can draw any number of circles around that center and they\u2019ll never overlap. They\u2019ll simply keep growing, growing, growing. They\u2019ll not intersect with one another if the center is all right. Unfortunately, although everyone is feeling nationally or internationally, the center is missing. Therefore your international feeling and my international feeling, your national feeling and my national feeling, are overlapping and conflicting. So we have to find the proper center for our loving feelings. Then you can expand your circle of feelings and it will not overlap or conflict with others\u2019.",
            "That center is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Our society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, is teaching the people of all countries that the center of their affection should be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, we are teaching people to bemah\u0101tm\u0101s.You may have heard this wordmah\u0101tm\u0101before. It is a Sanskrit word that is applied to a person whose mind is expanded, whose circle of feelings is very much expanded. This is amah\u0101tm\u0101. Mah\u0101means \u201cbig\u201d or \u201cgreat,\u201d and\u0101tm\u0101means \u201csoul.\u201d So he who has expanded his soul very wide is called amah\u0101tm\u0101.",
            "TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[7.19] gives a description of the person who has expanded his feelings very wide:",
            "bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m antej\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyatev\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam itisa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25",
            "The first idea in this verse is that one can become amah\u0101tm\u0101only after many, many births (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante). The soul is transmigrating through many bodies, one after another. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and we evolve through them until at last we come to the human form of life. Only then can we become amah\u0101tm\u0101.This is why K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saysbah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante:\u201cAfter many, many births one may become amah\u0101tm\u0101.\u201d",
            "In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere is a similar verse.Labdhv\u0101 su-durlabham ida\u1e41 bahu-sambhav\u0101nte:\u201cAfter many, many births you have achieved a human body, which is very difficult to get.\u201d This human form of life is not cheap. The bodies of cats and dogs and other animals are cheap, but this human form is not. After being born in at least 8,000,000 different species, we get this human form. So theBh\u0101gavatamand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101say the same thing. All Vedic literatures corroborate one another, and the person who can understand them doesn\u2019t find any contradiction.",
            "So the human form of life is obtained after many, many births in other-than-human forms of life. But even in this human form of life, many, many births are required for one who is cultivating knowledge of the central point of existence. If one is actually cultivating spiritual knowledge\u00a0\u2013 not in one life but in many, many lives\u00a0\u2013 one eventually comes to the highest platform of knowledge and is calledj\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n,\u201cthe possessor of true knowledge.\u201d Then, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate:\u201cHe surrenders unto Me, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God.\u201d (When I say \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d I mean the Supreme Lord, the all-attractive Supreme Personality of Godhead.)",
            "Now, why does a man in knowledge surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti:Because he knows that V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is everything\u00a0\u2013 that He is the central point of all loving feelings. Then,sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25.Here the wordmah\u0101tm\u0101is used. After cultivating knowledge for many, many births, a person who expands his consciousness up to the point of loving God\u00a0\u2013 he is amah\u0101tm\u0101,a great soul. God is great, and His devotee is also great. But, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25:That sort of great soul is very rarely to be seen. This is the description of amah\u0101tm\u0101we get from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "Now we have expanded our feelings of love to various objects. We may love our country, we may love our community, we may love our family, we may love our cats and dogs. In any case, we have love, and we expand it according to our knowledge. And when our knowledge is perfect, we come to the point of loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is perfection. Love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the aim of all activities, the aim of life.",
            "The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam[1.2.8] confirms that the goal of life is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a:",
            "dharma\u1e25 svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25 pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41vi\u1e63vaksena-kath\u0101su ya\u1e25notp\u0101dayed yadi rati\u1e41\u015brama eva hi kevalam",
            "The first words in this verse aredharma\u1e25 svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25 pu\u1e41s\u0101m.This means that everyone is doing his duty according to his position. A householder has some duty, asanny\u0101s\u012b[renunciant] has some duty, abrahmac\u0101r\u012b[celibate student] has some duty. There are different types of duties according to different occupations or professions. But, theBh\u0101gavatamsays, if by performing your duties very nicely you still do not come to the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then whatever you have done is simply useless labor (\u015brama eva hi kevalam). So if you want to come to the point of perfection, you should try to understand and love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then your national or international feelings of love will actually expand to their limit.",
            "Now, suppose a man says, \u201cYes, I have expanded my feelings of love very widely.\u201d That is all right, but he must show the symptoms of how his feelings of love are expanded. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[5.18]:",
            "vidy\u0101-vinaya-sampannebr\u0101hma\u1e47e gavi hastini\u015buni caiva \u015bva-p\u0101ke capa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25",

Because the vision of apa\u1e47\u1e0ditais no longer absorbed simply with the body, he sees a learnedbr\u0101hma\u1e47aas a spirit soul, he sees a dog as a spirit soul, he sees an elephant as a spirit soul, and he also sees a lowborn man as a spirit soul. From the highbornbr\u0101hma\u1e47adown to theca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la[outcaste], there are many social classes in human society, but if a man is really learned he sees everyone, every living entity, on the same level. That is the stage of true learning.",
            "We are trying to expand our feeling socially, communally, nationally, internationally, or universally. That is our natural function\u00a0\u2013 to expand our consciousness. But my point is that if we actually want to expand our consciousness to the utmost, we must find out the real center of existence. That center is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God. How do we know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares Himself to be God in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Please always remember that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is based on understandingBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is. Whatever I am speaking is in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unfortunately, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101has been misinterpreted by so many commentators that people have misunderstood it. Actually, the purport of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and we are trying to teach that.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given several descriptions of amah\u0101tm\u0101.He says,mah\u0101tm\u0101nas tu m\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101rtha daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25:\u201cAmah\u0101tm\u0101,one who is actually wise and broad-minded, is under the shelter of My spiritual energy.\u201d He is no longer under the spell of the material energy.",
            "Whatever we see is made up of various energies of God. In theUpani\u1e63adsit is said,par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate:\u201cThe Supreme Absolute Truth has many varieties of energies.\u201d And these energies are acting so nicely that it appears they are working automatically (sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca). For example, we have all seen a blooming flower. We may think that it has automatically blossomed and become so beautiful. But no, the material energy of God is acting.",
            "Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a spiritual energy. And amah\u0101tm\u0101,one who is broad-minded, is under the protection of that spiritual energy; he is not under the spell of the material energy. These things are all explained in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. There are many verses in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that describe how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies are working, and our mission is to presentBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is, without any nonsensical commentary. There is no need of nonsensical commentary.Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is as clear as the sunlight. Just as you don\u2019t require a lamp to see the sun, you don\u2019t require the commentary of an ignorant, common man to study theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. You should study theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is. Then you will get all spiritual knowledge. You will become wise and will understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then you will surrender to Him and become amah\u0101tm\u0101.",
            "Now, what are the activities of amah\u0101tm\u0101? Amah\u0101tm\u0101is under the protection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s spiritual energy, but what is the symptom of that protection? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,m\u0101m \u2026 bhajanty ananya-manasa\u1e25:\u201cAmah\u0101tm\u0101is always engaged in devotional service to Me.\u201d That is the main symptom of amah\u0101tm\u0101:he is always serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Does he engage in this devotional service blindly? No. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101dim avyayam:\u201cHe knows perfectly that I am the source of everything.\u201d",
            "So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains everything in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. And our purpose in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is to spread the knowledge contained in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101without adding any nonsensical commentary. Then the human society will profit from this knowledge. Now society is not in a sound condition, but if people understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,and if they actually broaden their outlook, all social, national, and international problems will be solved automatically. There will be no difficulty. But if we don\u2019t find out what the center of existence is, if we manufacture our own ways to expand our loving feelings, there will be only conflict\u00a0\u2013 not only between individual persons but between the different nations of the world. The nations are trying to be united; in your country there is the United Nations. Unfortunately, instead of the nations becoming united, the flags are increasing. Similarly, India was once one country, Hindustan. Now there is also Pakistan. And some time in the future there will be Sikhistan and then some other \u201cstan.\u201d",
            "Instead of becoming united we are becoming disunited, because we are missing the center. Therefore, my request, since you are all international students, is that you please try to find out the real center of your international movement. Real international feeling will be possible when you understand that the center is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then your international movement will be perfect.",
            "In the fourteenth chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[14.4], Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,",

            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am the father of all forms of life. The material nature is the mother, and I am the seed-giving father.\u201d Without a father and mother, nobody can be born. The father gives the seed, and the mother supplies the body. In this material world the mother of every one of us\u00a0\u2013 from Lord Brahm\u0101 down to the ant\u00a0\u2013 is the material nature. Our body is matter; therefore it is a gift of the material nature, our mother. But I, the spirit soul, am part and parcel of the supreme father, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo \u2026 j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25:\u201cAll these living entities are part and parcel of Me.\u201d",
            "So if you want to broaden your feelings of fellowship to the utmost limit, please try to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. You\u2019ll get enlightenment; you\u2019ll become a realmah\u0101tm\u0101.You will feel affection even for the cats and dogs and reptiles. In the Seventh Canto of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamyou\u2019ll find a statement by N\u0101rada Muni that if there is a snake in your house, you should give it something to eat. Just see how your feelings can expand! You\u2019ll care even for a snake, what to speak of other animals and human beings.",
            "So we cannot become enlightened unless we come to the point of understanding God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore we are preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is not new. As I told you, it is based on the principles of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is an ancient scripture. From the historical point of view it is five thousand years old. And from a prehistorical point of view it is millions of years old. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in the fourth chapter,ima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41 proktav\u0101n aham avyayam:\u201cI first spoke this ancient science of yogato the sun-god.\u201d That means K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101some millions of years ago. But simply from a historical point of view,Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101has existed since the days of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which was fought five thousand years ago. So it is older than any other scripture in the world.",
            "Try to understandBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is, without any unnecessary commentary. The words of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101are sufficient to give you enlightenment, but unfortunately people have taken advantage of the popularity of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and have tried to express their own philosophy under the shelter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. That is useless. Try to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is. Then you will get enlightenment; you will understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the center of all activities. And if you become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, everything will be perfect and all problems will be solved.",

No matter what one does, no matter what one thinks, no matter what one is involved with, eventually he will evolve toward Me.\u201d So is enlightenment a natural evolution?",

To become enlightened in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not natural for the conditioned soul. You require instruction from a spiritual master. Otherwise, why did K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instruct Arjuna? You have to get knowledge from a superior person and follow his instructions.",
            "Arjuna was perplexed. He could not understand whether he should fight or not. Similarly, everyone in the material world is perplexed. So we require guidance from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or his bona fide representative. Then we can become enlightened.",
            "Evolution is natural up through the animal species. But when we come to the human form of life, we can use our own discretion. As you like, you make your choice of which path to follow. If you like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you can go to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; if you like something else, you can go there. That depends on your discretion.",
            "Everyone has a little bit of independence. At the end of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[18.66] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cJust give up everything and surrender unto Me.\u201d If this surrender is natural, why would K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a say, \u201cYou should do this\u201d? No. Surrendering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not natural in our materially conditioned state. We have to learn it. Therefore we must hear from a bona fide spiritual master\u00a0\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His authorized representative\u00a0\u2013 and follow his instructions.

In the following speech, recorded on May 2, 1973, in Los Angeles, he advocates a simpler, more natural, God-centered lifestyle.",

            "Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization, and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we increase such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be dissatisfaction of the people in general, although a select few can live lavishly by exploitation.",
            "The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme, and as He desires, material nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts of nature and thus satisfactorily flourish without being captivated by the exploitative motive of lording it over material nature.",
            "The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, and herbs, then what is the necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals?",
            "A man need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields, and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills, and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk, etc., then why should we hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men?",
            "But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need, therefore, is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve the perfection of human life by devotional service. The indications by Kunt\u012b-dev\u012b are just to the point. She desires that God\u2019s mercy be bestowed upon her and her sons so that natural prosperity will be maintained by His grace.",
            "Kunt\u012b-dev\u012b mentions that the grains are abundant, the trees full of fruits, the rivers flowing nicely, the hills full of minerals, and the oceans full of wealth, but she never mentions that industry and slaughterhouses are flourishing, for such things are nonsense that men have developed to create problems.",

God\u2019s creation provides sufficient grains and grass, and while we eat the grains and fruits, the animals like the cows will eat the grass. The bulls will help us produce grains, and they will take only a little, being satisfied with what we throw away. If we take fruit and throw away the skin, the animal will be satisfied with the skin. In this way, with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the center, there can be full cooperation between the trees, animals, human beings, and all living entities.

A woman in touch with a man becomes agitated and becomes pregnant and then gives birth to children. The whole creation follows a similar process. Simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance, matter becomes agitated and then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities. It is simply by His glance that plants, trees, animals, and all other living beings come forth. How is this possible? None of us can say, \u201cSimply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant.\u201d But although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. TheBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101[5.32] says,a\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bttimanti:Every part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body has all the capabilities of the other parts. With our eyes we can only see, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can make others pregnant merely by looking at them. There is no need of sex, for simply by glancing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can create pregnancy.",
            "InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[9.10] Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram:\u201cBy My supervision, material nature gives birth to all moving and nonmoving beings.\u201d The wordak\u1e63ameans \u201ceyes,\u201d soak\u1e63e\u1e47aindicates that all living entities take birth because of the Lord\u2019s glance. There are two kinds of living entities\u00a0\u2013 the moving beings, like insects, animals, and human beings, and the nonmoving beings, like trees and plants. In Sanskrit these two kinds of living entities are calledsth\u0101vara-ja\u1e45gama,and they both come forth from material nature.",
            "Of course, what comes from material nature is not the life, but the body. The living entities accept particular types of bodies from material nature, just as a child takes its body from its mother. For ten months the child\u2019s body develops from the blood and nutrients of the mother\u2019s body, but the child is a living entity, not matter. It is the living entity that has taken shelter in the womb of the mother, who then supplies the ingredients for that living entity\u2019s body. This is nature\u2019s way. The mother may not know how from her body another body has been created, but when the body of the child is fit, the child takes birth.",
            "It is not that the living entity takes birth. As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[2.20],na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101:The living entity neither takes birth nor dies. That which does not take birth does not die; death is meant for that which has been created, and that which is not created has no death. TheG\u012bt\u0101says,na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 kad\u0101cit.The wordkad\u0101citmeans \u201cat any time.\u201d At no time does the living entity actually take birth.

            "A scientist friend once asked me, \u201cWhat is the proof of the soul\u2019s eternality?\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015b\u0101r\u012bre:\u201cThe soul is not killed when the body is killed.\u201d This statement in itself is proof. This type of proof is called\u015bruti,the proof established by that which is heard through the disciplic succession from the Supreme. One form of proof is proof by logic (ny\u0101ya-prasth\u0101na). One can get knowledge by logic, arguments, and philosophical research. But another form of proof is\u015bruti,proof established by hearing from authorities. A third form of proof issm\u1e5bti,proof established by statements derived from the\u015bruti.ThePur\u0101\u1e47asaresm\u1e5bti,theUpani\u1e63adsare\u015bruti,and theVed\u0101ntaisny\u0101ya.Of these three the\u015bruti-prasth\u0101na,or the evidence from the\u015bruti,is especially important.",
            "Pratyak\u1e63a,the process of receiving knowledge through direct perception, has no value, because our senses are all imperfect. For example, to us the sun looks like a small disk, but in fact it is many times larger than the earth. So what is the value of our direct perception through our eyes? We have so many senses through which we can experience knowledge\u00a0\u2013 the eyes, the ears, the nose, and so on\u00a0\u2013 but because these senses are imperfect, whatever knowledge we get by exercising these senses is also imperfect. Because scientists try to understand things by exercising their imperfect senses, their conclusions are always imperfect. Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara, a scientist among our disciples, inquired from a fellow scientist who says that life comes from matter, \u201cIf I give you the chemicals with which to produce life, will you be able to produce it?\u201d The scientist replied, \u201cThat I do not know.\u201d This is imperfect knowledge. If you do not know, then your knowledge is imperfect. Why then have you become a teacher? That is cheating. Our contention is that to become perfect one must take lessons from the perfect teacher.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is perfect, so we take knowledge from Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre:\u201cThe soul does not die when the body dies.\u201d Therefore this understanding that the soul is eternal and the body is temporary is perfect.",

The oyster produces pearls, and formerly people decorated their bodies with pearls, valuable stones, silk, gold, and silver. But where are those things now? Now, with the advancement of civilization, there are so many beautiful girls who have no ornaments of gold, pearls, or jewels, but only plastic bangles. So what is the use of industry and slaughterhouses?",
            "By God\u2019s arrangement one can have enough food grains, enough milk, enough fruits and vegetables, and nice clear river water. But now I have seen, while traveling in Europe, that all the rivers there have become nasty. In Germany, in France, and also in Russia and America I have seen that the rivers are nasty. By nature\u2019s way the water in the ocean is kept clear like crystal, and the same water is transferred to the rivers, but without salt, so that one may take nice water from the river. This is nature\u2019s way, and nature\u2019s way means K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s way. So what is the use of constructing huge waterworks to supply water?",
            "Nature has already given us everything. If we want wealth we may collect pearls and become rich; there is no need to become rich by starting some huge factory to produce auto bodies. By such industrial enterprises we have simply created troubles. Otherwise, we need only depend on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy, because by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance (tava v\u012bk\u1e63itai\u1e25), everything is set right. So if we simply plead for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance, there will be no question of scarcity or need. Everything will be complete. The idea of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, is to depend on nature\u2019s gifts and the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "People say that the population is increasing, and therefore they are checking this by artificial means. Why? The birds and beasts are increasing their populations and have no contraceptives, but are they in need of food? Do we ever see birds or animals dying for want of food? Perhaps in the city, although not very often. But if we go to the jungle we shall see that all the elephants, lions, tigers, and other animals are very stout and strong. Who is supplying them with food? Some of them are vegetarians and some of them are nonvegetarians, but none of them are in want of food.",
            "Of course, by nature\u2019s way the tiger, being a nonvegetarian, does not get food every day. After all, who will face a tiger to become its food? Who will say to the tiger, \u201cSir, I am an altruist and have come to you to give you food, so take my body\u201d? No one. Therefore the tiger has difficulty finding food. And as soon as the tiger is out, there is an animal that follows it and makes a sound like\u201cfayo, fayo,\u201dso that the other animals will know, \u201cNow the tiger is out.\u201d So by nature\u2019s way the tiger has difficulty. But still K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a supplies it food. After about a week, the tiger will get the chance to catch an animal, and because it does not get fresh food daily, it will keep the carcass in some bush and eat a little at a time. Since the tiger is very powerful, people want to become like a lion or a tiger. But that is not a very good proposition, because if one actually becomes like a tiger one won\u2019t get food daily, but will have to search for food with great labor. If one becomes a vegetarian, however, one will get food every day. The food for a vegetarian is available everywhere.",
            "Now in every city there are slaughterhouses, but does this mean that the slaughterhouses can supply enough so that one can live by eating only meat? No, there will not be an adequate supply. Even meat-eaters have to eat grains, fruits, and vegetables along with their slice of meat. Still, for that daily slice of meat they kill so many poor animals. How sinful this is! If people commit such sinful activities, how can they be happy? This killing should not be done, but because it is being done people are unhappy. However, if one becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and simply depends on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance (tava v\u012bk\u1e63itai\u1e25), K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will supply everything and there will be no question of scarcity.",
            "Sometimes there appears to be scarcity, and sometimes we find that grains and fruits are produced in such a huge quantity that people cannot finish eating them. So this is a question of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glance. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a likes, He can produce a huge quantity of grains, fruits, and vegetables, but if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires to restrict the supply, what good will meat do? You may eat me, or I may eat you, but that will not solve the problem.",
            "For real peace and tranquillity and a sufficient supply of milk, water, and everything else we need, we simply have to depend on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Now if You like You may kill me, or else You may give me protection.\u201d And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in reply, \u201cYes.Sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:Simply surrender exclusively unto Me.\u201d He does not say, \u201cYes, depend on Me, and also depend on your slaughterhouses and factories.\u201d No. He says, \u201cDepend only on Me.Aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi:I will rescue you from the results of your sinful activities.\u201d",
            "Because we have lived so many years without being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, we have lived only a sinful life, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a assures us that as soon as one surrenders to Him, He immediately squares all accounts and puts an end to all one\u2019s sinful activities so that one may begin a new life. When we initiate disciples we therefore tell them, \u201cNow the account is squared. Now don\u2019t commit sinful activities any more.\u201d",
            "One should not think that because the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can nullify sinful activities, one may commit a little sinful activity and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to nullify it. That is the greatest offense (n\u0101mno bal\u0101d yasya hi p\u0101pa-buddhi\u1e25). The members of some religious orders go to church and confess their sins, but then they again commit the same sinful activities. What, then, is the value of their confession? One may confess, \u201cMy Lord, out of my ignorance I committed this sin.\u201d But one should not plan, \u201cI shall commit sinful activities and then go to church and confess them, and then the sins will be nullified and I can begin a new chapter of sinful life.\u201d Similarly, one should not knowingly take advantage of the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantrato nullify sinful activities so that one may then begin sinful acts again. We should be very careful. Before taking initiation, one promises to have no illicit sex, no intoxicants, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and this vow one should strictly follow. Then one will be clean. If one keeps oneself clean in this way and always engages in devotional service, his life will be a success, and there will be no scarcity of anything he wants.",

As stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[2.13],tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25:\u201cWhen the body dies, the soul transmigrates to another body.\u201d I\u2019ve talked with big, big scientists and professors who do not know that there is life after death. They do not know. But according to our Vedic information, thereislife after death. And we can experience transmigration of the soul in this present life. It is a very common thing: A baby soon gets the body of a boy, the boy then gets the body of a young man, and the young man gets the body of an old man. Similarly, the old man, after the annihilation of his body, will get another body. It is quite natural and logical.",
            "Actually, we have two bodies, the gross body and the subtle body. The gross body is made up of our senses and the bodily elements\u00a0\u2013 bones, blood, and so on. When we change our body at death, the present gross body is destroyed, but the subtle body, made of mind, intelligence, and ego, is not. The subtle body carries us to our next gross body.",
            "It is just like what happens when we sleep. At night we forget about the gross body, and the subtle body alone works. As we dream we are taken away from our home, from our bed, to some other place, and we completely forget the gross body. When our sleep is over we forget about the dream and become attached again to the gross body. This is going on in our daily experience.",
            "So we are the observer, sometimes of the gross body and sometimes of the subtle body. Both bodies are changing, but we are the unchanging observer, the soulwithinthe bodies. Therefore, our inquiry should be, \u201cWhat is my position? At night I forget my gross body, and during the daytime I forget my subtle body. Then what is my real body?\u201d These are the questions we should ask.",
            "So you may do your business, as Arjuna did his business. He was a fighter, ak\u1e63atriya,but he did not forget his culture, hearingG\u012bt\u0101from the master. But if you simply do business and do not cultivate your spiritual life, then your business is a useless waste of time (\u015brama eva hi kevalam).",
            "Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is being spread so that you do not forget your cultural life. We do not say that you stop your business and become asanny\u0101s\u012blike me and give up everything. We do not say that. Nor did K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a say that. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never said, \u201cArjuna, give up your fighting business.\u201d No, He said, \u201cArjuna, you are ak\u1e63atriya.You are declining to fight, saying, `Oh, it is very abominable.\u2019 You should not say that. Youmustfight.\u201d That was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction.",
            "Similarly, we K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious people are also advising everyone, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your business. Go on with your business, but simply hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also said this, quoting from\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: sth\u0101ne sthit\u0101\u1e25 \u015bruti-gat\u0101\u1e41 tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25.Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu never said, \u201cGive up your position.\u201d Giving up one\u2019s position is not very difficult. But to cultivate spiritual knowledge while one stays in his position\u00a0\u2013 that is required. Among the animals there is no cultivation of spiritual life. That is not possible; the animals cannot cultivate this knowledge. Therefore, if human beings do not cultivate spiritual knowledge, they\u2019re exactly like animals (dharme\u1e47a h\u012bn\u0101\u1e25 pa\u015bubhi\u1e25 sam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25).",
            "So we should be very conscious about our eternal existence. We, the spirit soul within the body, are eternal (na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre). We are not going to die after the annihilation of our body. This is the cultivation of knowledge, orbrahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101,which means inquiry about one\u2019s self. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s first disciple, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, was formerly finance minister in the government of Nawab Hussein Shah. Then he retired and approached Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and humbly said, \u201cMy dear Lord, people call mepa\u1e47\u1e0dita.\u201d (Because he was abr\u0101hma\u1e47aby caste, naturally he was calledpa\u1e47\u1e0dita,meaning \u201ca learned person.\u201d) \u201cBut I am such apa\u1e47\u1e0dita,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I do not even know who or what I am.\u201d",
            "This is the position of everyone.

            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamyou will find many things which are foretold. There is mention of Lord Buddha\u2019s appearance and Lord Kalki\u2019s appearance. (Lord Kalki will appear at the end of the Kali-yuga.) There is also mention of Lord Caitanya\u2019s appearance. Although theBh\u0101gavatamwas written five thousand years ago, the writer knew past, present, and future (tri-k\u0101la-j\u00f1a), and thus he could predict all these events with perfect accuracy.",
            "So here \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is describing the chief symptoms of this age.

            "Of course, there are otheryugasbesides Kali-yuga. During the Satya-yuga, which lasted eighteen hundred thousand years, human beings lived for one hundred thousand years. The duration of the next age, the Tret\u0101-yuga, was twelve hundred thousand years, and the people of that age used to live for ten thousand years. In other words, the duration of life was ten times reduced. In the next age, Dv\u0101para-yuga, the life span was again ten times reduced\u00a0\u2013 people used to live for one thousand years\u00a0\u2013 and the duration of the Dv\u0101para Age was eight hundred thousand years. Then, in the next age, this Kali-yuga, we can live up to one hundred years at the utmost. We are not living one hundred years, but still, the limit is one hundred years. So just see: from one hundred years the average duration of life has decreased to about seventy years. And it will eventually decrease to the point where if a man lives for twenty to thirty years, he will be considered a very old man.",
            "Another symptom of the Kali-yuga predicted in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamis the decrease in memory (sm\u1e5bti). We see nowadays that people do not have very sharp memories\u00a0\u2013 they forget easily. They may hear something daily, yet still they forget it. Similarly, bodily strength (balam) is decreasing. You can all understand this, because you know that your father or grandfather was physically stronger than you are. So, bodily strength is decreasing, memory is decreasing, and the duration of life is decreasing\u00a0\u2013 and all of this is predicted in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.",
            "Another symptom of Kali-yuga is the decrease in religion. There is practically no question of religion in this age\u00a0\u2013 it has almost decreased to nil. No one is interested in religion. The churches and temples are being closed, locked up. The building we are sitting in was once a church, but it was sold because no one was coming. Similarly, we are purchasing a very big church in Australia, and in London I have seen many hundreds of vacant churches\u00a0\u2013 no one is going there. And not only churches: in India also, except for a few important temples, the ordinary, small temples are being closed. They have become the habitation of the dogs. Sodharma,religion, is decreasing.",
            "Truthfulness, cleanliness, and forgiveness are also decreasing. Formerly, if someone did something wrong, the other party would forgive him. For example, Arjuna was tortured by his enemies, yet still, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra he said, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, let me leave. I don\u2019t want to kill them.\u201d This is forgiveness. But now, even for a small insult people will kill. This is going on. Also, there is now no mercifulness (day\u0101). Even if you see someone being killed in front of you, you will not take interest. These things are happening already. So, religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, forgiveness, mercifulness, duration of life, bodily strength, and memory\u00a0\u2013 these eight things will decrease, decrease, decrease, decrease. When you see these symptoms, you should know the age of Kali is making progress.",

I married when I was a student, but I did not know who my wife would be; my parents arranged everything. Another example is Dr. Rajendra Prasada, the first president of India. In his biography he wrote that he married at the age of eight. Similarly, my father-in-law married when he was eleven years old, and my mother-in-law when she was seven. So the point is that formerly, in India, marriage took place only after an astrological calculation of past, present, and future had determined whether the couple would be happy in their life together. When marriage is thus sanctified, the man and the woman live peacefully and practice spiritual culture. Each one helps the other, so they live very happily and become advanced in spiritual life. And at last they go back home, back to Godhead. That is the system. Not that a grown-up girl and a grown-up boy mix together, and if he likes her and she likes him they get married, and then he leaves or she leaves \u2026 This kind of marriage was not sanctioned.

So how is this a bad proposal? If you say, \u201cYou are restraining us from meat-eating\u201d\u00a0\u2013 no, we don\u2019t restrain you. We simply ask you, \u201cDon\u2019t kill. When the cow is dead, you can eat it.\u201d",
            "Yoge\u015bvara d\u0101sa:You\u2019ve pointed out that the cow is just like a mother.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. She gives us her milk.",
            "Yoge\u015bvara d\u0101sa:But in the West now, when their parents grow old the people generally send them away to old age homes. So if people have no compassion even toward their own parents, how can we educate them to protect the cow?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:They don\u2019t have to protect the cow.Weshall protect the cow. Simply we ask them, \u201cDon\u2019t purchase meat from the slaughterhouse. We shall supply you the cow after her death.\u201d Where is the difficulty?",
            "Satsvar\u016bpa d\u0101sa Goswami:Not enough meat fast enough\u00a0\u2013 they\u2019re eating so much meat.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:\u201cNot enough\u201d? By killing the cows, how will you get any more meat? The total number of cows will remain the same. Simply wait for their natural death. That is the only restriction. You have got a limited number of cows. Either you wait for their death or you kill them at once\u00a0\u2013 the number of cows is the same. So we simply ask you, \u201cDon\u2019t kill them. Wait for their natural death and then take the meat.\u201d What is the difficulty? And we simply ask you, \u201cAs long as they\u2019re alive, let us take the cow\u2019s milk and prepare delicious foods for the whole human society.\u201d",
            "Yoge\u015bvara d\u0101sa:If people don\u2019t kill the cows they will have even more meat, because that way the cows will have more time to reproduce more cows. If they don\u2019t kill the cows right away, there will be even more cows.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:More cows, yes. They\u2019ll have more cows. We simply request, \u201cDon\u2019t kill. Don\u2019t maintain slaughterhouses.\u201d That is very sinful. It brings down very severe karmic reactions upon society. Stop these slaughterhouses. We don\u2019t say, \u201cStop eating meat.\u201d You can eat meat, but don\u2019t take it from the slaughterhouse, by killing. Simply wait, and you\u2019ll get the carcasses.",
            "After all, how long will the cows live? Their maximum age is twenty years, and there are many cows who live only eighteen, sixteen, or ten years. So wait that much time; then regularly get dead cows and eat. What is the difficulty?",
            "For the first few years you may not get quite as much as now. During that time you can eat some dogs and cats. [Laughter.] Yes. In Korea they eat dogs. What is the difference between here and Korea? You can also eat dogs for the time being. Or hogs. Eat hogs. We don\u2019t prohibit the killing of these less important animals. We neither sanction nor prohibit. But especially we request cow protection, because it is ordered by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Go-rak\u1e63ya:\u201cProtect the cows.\u201d That is our duty.",
            "And economically, also, it is very useful. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has not recommended this for nothing; it is not like that. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order has meaning. The cows on our Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a farms are giving more milk than other cows\u00a0\u2013 because they are confident, \u201cWe will not be killed here.\u201d It is not like these rascals, these so-called Christians, say: \u201cThey have no soul; they have no intelligence.\u201d Theyhaveintelligence. In other places they do not give so much milk. But on our farms they are very jolly. As soon as the devotees call, they\u2019ll come. Yes\u00a0\u2013 just like friends. And they are confident, \u201cWe\u2019ll not be killed.\u201d So they are jubilant, and they are giving much milk. Yes.",
            "In Europe and America the cows are very good, but the cow-killing system is also very good. So you stop this. You simply request them, \u201cYou\u2019ll get the cow\u2019s flesh. As soon as she is dead, we shall supply you free of charge. You haven\u2019t got to pay so much money. You can get the flesh free and eat it then. Why are you killing? Stop these slaughterhouses.\u201d What is wrong with this proposal?",
            "We don\u2019t want to stop trade or the production of grains and vegetables and fruit. But we want to stop these killing houses. It is very, very sinful. That is why all over the world they have so many wars. Every ten or fifteen years there is a big war\u00a0\u2013 a wholesale slaughterhouse for humankind. But these rascals\u00a0\u2013 they do not see it, that by the law ofkarma,every action must have its reaction.",
            "You are killing innocent cows and other animals\u00a0\u2013 nature will take revenge. Just wait. As soon as the time is right, nature will gather all these rascals and slaughter them. Finished. They\u2019ll fight amongst themselves\u00a0\u2013 Protestants and Catholics, Russia and America, this one and that one. It is going on. Why? That is nature\u2019s law. Tit for tat. \u201cYou have killed. Now you killyourselves.\u201d",

The Roman Catholics are killing the Protestants, and the Protestants are killing the Catholics. This is nature\u2019s law. It\u2019s not necessary that you be sent to the ordinary slaughterhouse. You\u2019ll make a slaughterhouse at home. You\u2019ll kill your own child\u00a0\u2013 abortion. This is nature\u2019s law. Who are these children being killed? They are these meat-eaters. They enjoyed themselves when so many animals were killed, and now they\u2019re being killed by their mothers.

Of course, as in any village, there were rats. But the rats would take the rice and not cut even a single cloth. Cloth is very costly. If even one cloth had been cut by a rat, then it would have been a great loss. So with a few pennies\u2019 worth of rice, he saved many dollars\u2019 worth of cloth.

            "A Formula for Peace",
            "This article by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da was first published in 1956 in New Delhi, India, inBack to Godhead,the magazine he founded in 1944. Appealing to his Indian readers to \u201cemploy everything in transcendental service for the interest of the Lord,\u201d he concludes that \u201cthis alone can bring the desired peace.\u201d",
            "In the revealed scriptures the Supreme Lord is described as sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. Satmeans \u201ceternal,\u201dcitmeans \u201cfully cognizant,\u201d\u0101nandameans \u201cjoyful,\u201d andvigrahameans \u201ca specific personality.\u201d Therefore the Lord, or the Supreme Godhead, who is one without a second, is an eternal, joyful personality with a full sense of His own identity. That is a concise description of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to or greater than Him.",
            "The living entities, orj\u012bvas,are minute samples of the Supreme Lord, and therefore we find in their activities the desire for eternal existence, the desire for knowledge of everything, and an urge for seeking happiness in diverse ways. These three qualities of the living being are minutely visible in human society, but they are increased and enjoyed one hundred times more by the beings who reside in the upper planets, which are called Bh\u016brloka, Svarloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Maharloka, Brahmaloka, and so forth.",
            "But even the standard of enjoyment on the highest planet in the material world, which is thousands and thousands of times superior to what we enjoy on this earth, is also described as insignificant in comparison to the spiritual bliss enjoyed in the company of the Supreme Lord. His loving service in different mellows (relationships) makes even the enjoyment of merging with the impersonal spiritual effulgence as insignificant as a drop of water compared with the ocean.",
            "Every living being is ambitious to have the topmost level of enjoyment in the material world, and yet one is always unhappy here. This unhappiness is present on all the above-mentioned planets, in spite of a long life span and high standards of comfort.",
            "That is the law of material nature. One can increase the duration of life and standard of comfort to the highest capacity, and yet by the law of material nature one will be unhappy. The reason is that the quality of happiness suitable for our constitution is different from the happiness derived from material activities. The living entity is a minute particle ofsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha,and therefore he necessarily has a propensity for joyfulness that is spiritual in quality. But he is vainly trying to derive his spiritual joyfulness from the foreign atmosphere of the material nature.",
            "A fish that is taken out of the water cannot be happy by any arrangement for happiness on the land\u00a0\u2013 it must have an aquatic habitation. In the same way, the minutesac-cid-\u0101nandaliving entity cannot be really happy through any amount of material planning conceived by his illusioned brain. Therefore, the living entity must be given a different type of happiness, a transcendental happiness, which is called spiritual bliss. Our ambitions should be aimed at enjoying spiritual bliss and not material happiness.",
            "The ambition for spiritual bliss is good, but the method of attaining this standard is not merely to negate material happiness. Theoretical negation of material activities, as propounded by \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, may be relevant for an insignificant section of men, but the devotional activities propounded by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are the best and surest way of attaining spiritual bliss. In fact, they change the very face of material nature.",
            "Hankering after material happiness is called lust, and in the long run lustful activities are sure to meet with frustration. The body of a venomous snake is very cool. But if a man wants to enjoy the coolness of the snake\u2019s body and therefore garlands himself with the snake, then surely he will be killed by the snake\u2019s bite. The material senses are like snakes, and indulging in so-called material happiness surely kills one\u2019s spiritual self-awareness. Therefore a sane man should be ambitious to find the real source of happiness.",
            "Once, a foolish man who had no experience of the taste of sugarcane was told by a friend to taste its sweetness. When the man inquired about sugarcane\u2019s appearance, the friend imperfectly informed him that sugarcane resembles a bamboo stick. The foolish man thus began trying to extract sugarcane juice from a bamboo stick, but naturally he was baffled in his attempt.",
            "That is the position of the illusioned living being in his search for eternal happiness within the material world, which is not only full of miseries but also transient and flickering. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the material world is described as full of miseries. The ambition for happiness is good, but the attempt to derive it from inert matter by so-called scientific arrangements is an illusion. Befooled persons cannot understand this. TheG\u012bt\u0101[16.13] describes how a person driven by the lust for material happiness thinks, \u201cSo much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future.\u201d",
            "The atheistic, or godless, civilization is a huge affair of sense gratification, and everyone is now mad after money to keep up an empty show. Everyone is seeking money because that is the medium of exchange for sense-gratificatory objects. To expect peace in such an atmosphere of gold-rush pandemonium is a utopian dream. As long as there is even a slight tinge of madness for sense gratification, peace will remain far, far away. The reason is that by nature everyone is an eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord, and therefore we cannot enjoy anything for our personal interest. We have to employ everything in transcendental service for the interest of the Lord. This alone can bring about the desired peace. A part of the body cannot make itself satisfied; it can only serve the whole body and derive satisfaction from that service. But now everyone is busy in self-interested business, and no one is prepared to serve the Lord. That is the basic cause of material existence.",
            "From the highest executive administrator down to the lowest sweeper in the street, everyone is working with the thought of unlawful accumulation of wealth. But to work merely for one\u2019s self-interest is unlawful and destructive. Even the cultivation of spiritual realization merely for one\u2019s self-interest is unlawful and destructive.",
            "As a result of all the unlawful money-making, there is no scarcity of money in the world. But there is a scarcity of peace. Since the whole of our human energy has been diverted to this money-making, the money-making capacity of the total population has certainly increased. But the result is that such an unrestricted and unlawful inflation of money has created a bad economy and has enabled us to manufacture huge, costly weapons that threaten to destroy the very result of such money-making.",
            "Instead of enjoying peace, the leaders of big money-making countries are now making big plans how they can save themselves from the modern destructive weapons, and yet a huge sum of money is being thrown into the sea for experiments with such dreadful weapons. Such experiments are being carried out not only at huge monetary costs, but also at the cost of many poor lives, thereby binding such nations to the laws ofkarma.That is the illusion of material nature. As a result of the impulse for sense gratification, money is earned by spoiled energy, and it is then spent for the destruction of the human race. The energy of the human race is thus spoiled by the law of nature because that energy is diverted from the service of the Lord, who is actually the owner of all energies.",
            "Wealth derives from mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b, or the goddess of fortune. As the Vedic literatures explain, the goddess of fortune is meant to serve Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the source of all thenaras,or living beings. Thenarasare also meant to serve N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, under the guidance of the goddess of fortune. The living being cannot enjoy the goddess of fortune without serving N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore whoever desires to enjoy her wrongly will be punished by the laws of nature, and the money itself will become the cause of destruction instead of being the cause of peace and prosperity.",
            "Such unlawfully accumulated money is now being snatched away from the miserly citizens by various methods of state taxation for the various national and international war funds, which spend the money in a wasteful manner. The citizen is no longer satisfied with just enough money to maintain his family nicely and cultivate spiritual knowledge, both of which are essential in human life. He now wants money unlimitedly for satisfying insatiable desires, and in proportion to his unlawful desires his accumulated money is now being taken away by the agents of the illusory nature in the shape of medical practitioners, lawyers, tax collectors, societies, institutions, and so-called religionists, as well as by famines, earthquakes, and many other such calamities.",
            "One miser who, under the dictation of the illusory nature, hesitated to purchase a copy ofBack to Godheadspent twenty-five hundred dollars for a week\u2019s supply of medicine and then died. A similar thing happened when a man who refused to spend a cent for the service of the Lord wasted thirty-five hundred dollars in a legal suit between the members of his household. That is the law of nature. If money is not devoted to the service of the Lord, by the law of nature it must be spent as spoiled energy in the fight against legal problems, diseases, and so on. Foolish people have no eyes to see such facts, so necessarily the laws of the Supreme Lord befool them.",
            "The laws of nature do not allow us to accept more money than is required for proper maintenance. There is ample arrangement by the law of nature to provide every living being with his due share of food and shelter, but the insatiable lust of the human being has disturbed the whole arrangement of the almighty father of all species of life.",
            "By the arrangement of the Supreme Lord, there is an ocean of salt, because salt is necessary for the living being. In the same manner, God has arranged for sufficient air and light, which are also essential for the living being. One can collect any amount of salt from the storehouse, but one cannot take more salt than he needs. If he takes more salt he spoils the broth, and if he takes less salt his eatables become tasteless. On the other hand, if he takes only what he absolutely requires, the food is tasty, and he is healthy. So ambition for wealth, for more than we need, is harmful, just as eating more salt than we absolutely need is harmful. That is the law of nature."

These sessions were recorded and published to provide an understanding of Western philosophy, psychology, and science from the viewpoint of the timeless teachings of India\u2019s Vedic literature. In the following conversation, the striking similarities between Plato\u2019s ideal state and that outlined in theBhagavad-g\u012btaprompt one to ask, \u201cCould Plato have gotten his ideas from India\u2019s ancientVedas?\u201d",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato believed society can enjoy prosperity and harmony only if it places people in working categories or classes according to their natural abilities. He thought people should find out their natural abilities and use those abilities to their fullest capacity\u00a0\u2013 as administrators, as military men, or as craftsmen. Most important, the head of state should not be an average or mediocre man. Instead, society should be led by a very wise and good man\u00a0\u2013 a \u201cphilosopher king\u201d\u00a0\u2013 or a group of very wise and good men.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:This idea appears to be taken from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that the ideal society has four divisions:br\u0101hma\u1e47as[intellectuals],k\u1e63atriyas[warriors and administrators],vai\u015byas[merchants and farmers], and\u015b\u016bdras[laborers]. These divisions come about by the influence of the modes of nature. Everyone, both in human society and in animal society, is influenced by the modes of material nature [sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a,andtamo-gu\u1e47a,or goodness, passion, and ignorance]. By scientifically classifying men according to these qualities, society can become perfect. But if we place a man in the mode of ignorance in a philosopher\u2019s post, or put a philosopher to work as an ordinary laborer, havoc will result.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as\u00a0\u2013the most intelligent men, who are interested in transcendental knowledge and philosophy\u00a0\u2013 should be given the topmost posts, and under their instructions thek\u1e63atriyas[administrators] should work. The administrators should see that there is law and order and that everyone is doing his duty. The next section is the productive class, thevai\u015byas,who engage in agriculture and cow protection. And finally there are the\u015b\u016bdras,common laborers who help the other sections. This is Vedic civilization\u00a0\u2013 people living simply, on agriculture and cow protection. If you have enough milk, grains, fruits, and vegetables, you can live very nicely.",
            "The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamcompares the four divisions of society to the different parts of the body\u00a0\u2013 the head, the arms, the belly, and the legs. Just as all parts of the body cooperate to keep the body fit, in the ideal state all sections of society cooperate under the leadership of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as.Comparatively, the head is the most important part of the body, for it gives directions to the other parts of the body. Similarly, the ideal state functions under the directions of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,who are not personally interested in political affairs or administration because they have a higher duty. At present this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trainingbr\u0101hma\u1e47as.If the administrators take our advice and conduct the state in a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious way, there will be an ideal society throughout the world.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:How does modern society differ from the Vedic ideal?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Now there is large-scale industrialization, which means exploitation of one man by another. Such industry was unknown in Vedic civilization\u00a0\u2013 it was unnecessary. In addition, modern civilization has taken to slaughtering and eating animals, which is barbarous. It is not even human.",
            "In Vedic civilization, when a person was unfit to rule he was deposed. For instance, King Vena proved to be an unfit king. He was simply interested in hunting. Of course,k\u1e63atriyasare allowed to hunt, but not whimsically. They are not allowed to kill many birds and beasts unnecessarily, as King Vena was doing and as people do today. At that time the intelligentbr\u0101hma\u1e47asobjected and immediately killed him with a curse. Formerly, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ashad so much power that they could kill simply by cursing; weapons were unnecessary.",
            "At present, however\u00a0\u2013 because the head of the social body is missing\u00a0\u2013 it is a dead body. The head is very important, and our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is attempting to create somebr\u0101hma\u1e47aswho will form the head of society. Then the administrators will be able to rule very nicely under the instructions of the philosophers and theologians\u00a0\u2013 that is, under the instructions of God conscious people. A God consciousbr\u0101hma\u1e47awould never advise opening slaughterhouses. But now, the many rascals heading the government allow animal slaughter. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it saw a degraded man trying to kill a cow, he immediately drew his sword and said, \u201cWho are you? Why are you trying to kill this cow?\u201d He was a real king. Nowadays, unqualified men have taken the presidential post. And although they may pose themselves as very religious, they are simply rascals. Why? Because under their noses thousands of cows are being killed, while they collect a good salary. Any leader who is at all religious should resign his post in protest if cow slaughter goes on under his rule. Since people do not know that these administrators are rascals, they are suffering. And the people are also rascals because they are voting for these bigger rascals. It is Plato\u2019s view that the government should be ideal, and this is the ideal: The saintly philosophers should be at the head of the state; according to their advice the politicians should rule; under the protection of the politicians, the productive class should provide the necessities of life; and the laborer class should help. This is the scientific division of society that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advocates in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101[4.13]:c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25.\u201cAccording to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.\u201d",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato also observed social divisions. However, he advocated three divisions. One class consisted of the guardians, men of wisdom who governed society. Another class consisted of the warriors, who were courageous and who protected the rest of society. And the third class consisted of the artisans, who performed their services obediently and worked only to satisfy their appetites.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, human society does have this threefold division, also. The first-class man is in the mode of goodness, the second-class man is in the mode of passion, and the third-class man is in the mode of ignorance.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato\u2019s understanding of the social order was based on his observation that man has a threefold division of intelligence, courage, and appetite. He said that the soul has these three qualities.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:That is a mistake. The soul does not have any material qualities. The soul is pure, but because of his contact with the different qualities of material nature, he is \u201cdressed\u201d in various bodies. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement aims at removing this material dress. Our first instruction is \u201cYou are not this body.\u201d It appears that in his practical understanding Plato identified the soul with the bodily dress, and that does not show very good intelligence.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato believed that man\u2019s position is marginal\u00a0\u2013 between matter and spirit\u00a0\u2013 and therefore he also stressed the development of the body. He thought that everyone should be educated from an early age, and that part of that education should be gymnastics\u00a0\u2013 to keep the body fit.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:This means that in practice Plato very strongly identified the self as the body. What was Plato\u2019s idea of education?",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:To awaken the student to his natural position\u00a0\u2013 whatever his natural abilities or talents are.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:And what is that natural position?",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:The position of moral goodness. In other words, Plato thought everyone should be educated to work in whatever way is best suited to awaken his natural moral goodness.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:But moral goodness is not enough, because simple morality will not satisfy the soul. One has to go above morality\u00a0\u2013 to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course, in this material world morality is taken as the highest principle, but there is another platform, which is called the transcendental (vasudeva) platform. Man\u2019s highest perfection is on that platform, and this is confirmed in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. However, because Western philosophers have no information of thevasudevaplatform, they consider the material mode of goodness to be the highest perfection and the end of morality. But in this world even moral goodness is infected by the lower modes of ignorance and passion. You cannot find pure goodness (\u015buddha-sattva) in this material world, for pure goodness is the transcendental platform. To come to the platform of pure goodness, which is the ideal, one has to undergo austerities (tapas\u0101 brahmacarye\u1e47a \u015bamena ca damena ca). One has to practice celibacy and control the mind and senses. If he has money, he should distribute it in charity. Also, one should always be very clean. In this way one can rise to the platform of pure goodness.",
            "There is another process for coming to the platform of pure goodness\u00a0\u2013 and that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, all the good qualities automatically develop in him. Automatically he leads a life of celibacy, controls his mind and senses, and has a charitable disposition. In this age of Kali, people cannot possibly be trained to engage in austerity. Formerly, abrahmac\u0101r\u012b[celibate student] would undergo austere training. Even though he might be from a royal or learned family, abrahmac\u0101r\u012bwould humble himself and serve the spiritual master as a menial servant. He would immediately do whatever the spiritual master ordered. Thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bwould beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master, claiming nothing for himself. Whatever he earned he would give to the spiritual master, because the spiritual master would not spoil the money by spending it for sense gratification\u00a0\u2013 he would use it for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is austerity. Thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bwould also observe celibacy, and because he followed the directions of the spiritual master, his mind and senses were controlled.",
            "Today, however, this austerity is very difficult to follow, so \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has given the process of taking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. In this case, one need simply chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and follow the regulative principles given by the spiritual master. Then one immediately rises to the platform of pure goodness.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato thought the state should train citizens to be virtuous. His system of education went like this: For the first three years of life, the child should play and strengthen his body. From three to six, the child should learn religious stories. From seven to ten, he should learn gymnastics; from ten to thirteen, reading and writing; from fourteen to sixteen, poetry and music; from sixteen to eighteen, mathematics. And from eighteen to twenty, he should undergo military drill. From twenty to thirty-five, those who are scientific and philosophical should remain in school and continue learning, and the warriors should engage in military exercises.",

            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato said this type of education reveals what category a person belongs to. He did have the right idea that one belongs to a particular class according to his qualification.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, that we also say, but we disagree that everyone should go through the same training. The spiritual master should judge the tendency or disposition of the student at the start of his education. He should be able to see whether a boy is fit for military training, administration, or philosophy, and then he should fully train the boy according to his particular tendency. If one is naturally inclined to philosophical study, why should he waste his time in the military? And if one is naturally inclined to military training, why should he waste his time with other things? Arjuna belonged to ak\u1e63atriya[warrior] family. He and his brothers were never trained as philosophers. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was their master and teacher, and although he was abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,he taught themDhanur Veda[military science], notbrahma-vidy\u0101. Brahma-vidy\u0101is theistic philosophy. No one should be trained in everything; that is a waste of time. If one is inclined toward production, business, or agriculture, he should be trained in those fields. If one is philosophical, he should be trained as a philosopher. If one is militaristic, he should be trained as a warrior. And if one has ordinary ability, he should remain a\u015b\u016bdra,or laborer. This is stated by N\u0101rada Muni in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: yasya yal-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 proktam.The four classes of society are recognized by their symptoms and qualifications. N\u0101rada Muni also says that one should be selected for training according to his qualifications. Even if one is born in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, he should be considered a\u015b\u016bdraif his qualifications are those of a\u015b\u016bdra.And if one is born in a\u015b\u016bdrafamily, he should be taken as abr\u0101hma\u1e47aif his symptoms are brahminical. The spiritual master should be expert enough to recognize the tendencies of the student and immediately train him in that line. This is perfect education.",

            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:No, that is wrong\u00a0\u2013 because the soul is continuous, and therefore everyone has some tendency from his previous birth. I think Plato didn\u2019t realize this continuity of the soul from body to body. According to the Vedic culture, immediately after a boy\u2019s birth astrologers should calculate what category he belongs to. Astrology can help if there is a first-class astrologer. Such an astrologer can tell what line a boy is coming from and how he should be trained. Plato\u2019s method of education was imperfect because it was based on speculation.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Plato observed that a particular combination of the three modes of nature is acting in each individual.",

            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Because he claimed that the person\u2019s natural abilities will not manifest unless he is given a chance to try everything. He saw that some people listen primarily to their intelligence, and he said they are governed by the head. He saw that some people have an aggressive disposition, and he said such courageous types are governed by the heart\u00a0\u2013 by passion. And he saw that some people, who are inferior, simply want to feed their appetites. He said these people are animalistic, and he believed they are governed by the liver.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:That is not a perfect description. Everyone has a liver, a heart, and all the bodily limbs. Whether one is in the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance depends on one\u2019s training and on the qualities he acquired during his previous life. According to the Vedic process, at birth one is immediately given a classification. Psychological and physical symptoms are considered, and generally it is ascertained from birth that a child has a particular tendency. However, this tendency may change according to circumstances, and if one does not fulfill his assigned role, he can be transferred to another class. One may have had brahminical training in a previous life, and he may exhibit brahminical symptoms in this life, but one should not think that because he has taken birth in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily he is automatically abr\u0101hma\u1e47a.A person may be born in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily and be a\u015b\u016bdra.It is a question not of birth but of qualification.",

For example, if a child is crying but the mother does not know why, the child will not stop simply by giving him some milk. Sometimes this actually happens: the mother cannot understand why her child is crying, and though she is giving him her breast, he continues to cry. Similarly, dissatisfaction in human society is not caused solely by low economic production. That is nonsense. There are many causes of dissatisfaction. The practical example is America, where there is sufficient production of everything, yet the young men are becoming hippies. They are dissatisfied, confused.

These two things must be there: an enjoyer and a worker. For example, in our body the stomach is the enjoyer and all other parts of the body are workers. So this system is natural: there must always be someone who is the enjoyer and someone who is the worker. It is present in the capitalist system also.

Because they have no idea of the pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the materialists regard sex as the highest pleasure. And how is it actually experienced? We have an itch, and when we scratch it, we feel some pleasure. But the aftereffects of sexual pleasure are abominable. The mother has to undergo labor pains, and the father has to take responsibility for raising the children nicely and giving them an education. Of course, if one is irresponsible like cats and dogs, that is another thing. But for those who are actually gentlemen, is it not painful to bear and raise children? Certainly. Therefore everyone is avoiding children by contraceptive methods.

So the whole problem is how to stop these miseries and attain permanent happiness. Unless one stops his materialistic way of life, with its threefold miseries and repeated birth and death, there is no question of happiness. The whole Vedic civilization is based on how one can cure this materialistic disease. If we can cure this disease, its symptoms will automatically vanish.

In the beginning he should learn how to restrain his senses. If a child is taught to become saintly, his semen rises to his brain, and he is able to understand spiritual values. Wasting semen decreases intelligence. So from the beginning, if he is abrahmac\u0101r\u012band does not misuse his semen, then he will become intelligent and strong and fully grown.",
            "For want of this education, everyone\u2019s brain and bodily growth are being stunted. After the boy has been trained as abrahmac\u0101r\u012b, if he still wants to enjoy sex he may get married. But because he then has full strength of body and brain, he will immediately beget a male child. And because he has been trained from childhood to renounce materialistic enjoyment, when he is fifty years old he can retire from household life. At that time naturally his firstborn child will be twenty-five years old, and he can take responsibility for maintaining the household. Household life is simply a license for sex life\u00a0\u2013 that\u2019s all. Sex is not required, but one who cannot restrain himself is given a license to get married and have sex. This is the real program that will save society. By speculating on some shock that may or may not have occurred in childhood, one will never discover the root disease. The sex impulse, as well as the impulse to become intoxicated and to eat meat, is present from the very beginning of life. Therefore one must restrain himself. Otherwise he will be implicated.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:So the Western system of bringing up children seems artificial because the parents either repress the child too severely or don\u2019t restrict him at all.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:That is not good. The Vedic system is to give the child direction for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. There must be some repression, but our use of repression is different. We say the child must rise early in the morning, worship the Deity in the temple, and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the beginning, force may be necessary. Otherwise the child will not become habituated. But the idea is to divert his attention to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. Then, when he realizes he is not his body, all difficulties will disappear. As one increases his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he becomes neglectful of all these material things. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the prime remedy\u00a0\u2013 the panacea for all diseases.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Freud divided the personality into three departments: the ego, the superego, and the id. The id is the irrational instinct for enjoyment. The ego is one\u2019s image of his own body, and is the instinct for self-preservation. The superego represents the moral restrictions of parents and other authorities.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:It is certainly true that everyone has some false egoism, oraha\u1e45k\u0101ra.For example, Freud thought he was Austrian. That is false ego, or identifying oneself with one\u2019s place of birth. We are giving everyone the information that this identification with a material body is ignorance. It is due to ignorance only that I think I am Indian, American, Hindu, or Muslim. This is egoism of the inferior quality. The superior egoism is, \u201cI am Brahman. I am an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d If a child is taught this superior egoism from the beginning, then automatically his false egoism is stopped.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Freud says that the ego tries to preserve the individual by organizing and controlling the irrational demands of the id. In other words, if the id sees something, like food, it automatically demands to eat it, and the ego controls that desire in order to preserve the individual. The superego reinforces this control. So these three systems are always conflicting in the personality.",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:But the basic principle is false, since Freud has no conception of the soul existing beyond the body. He is considering the body only. Therefore he is a great fool. According tobh\u0101gavataphilosophy, anyone in the bodily concept of life\u00a0\u2013 anyone who identifies this body, composed of mucus, bile, and air, as his self\u00a0\u2013 is no better than an ass.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Then these interactions of the id, the ego, and the superego are all bodily interactions?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes, they are all subtle bodily interactions. The mind is the first element of the subtle body. The gross senses are controlled by the mind, which in turn is controlled by the intelligence. And the intelligence is controlled by the ego. So if the ego is false, then everything is false. If I falsely identify with this body because of false ego, then anything based on this false idea is also false. This is calledm\u0101y\u0101,or illusion. The whole of Vedic education aims at getting off this false platform and coming to the real platform of spiritual knowledge, calledbrahma-j\u00f1\u0101na.When one comes to the knowledge that he is spirit soul, he immediately becomes happy. All his troubles are due to the false ego, and as soon as the individual realizes his true ego, the blazing fire of material existence is immediately extinguished. These philosophers are simply describing the blazing fire, but we are trying to get him out of the burning prison house of the material world altogether. They may attempt to make him happy within the fire, but how can they be successful? He must be saved from the fire. Then he will be happy. That is the message of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and that is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s message in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Freud identifies the body with the soul. He does not know the basic principle of spiritual understanding, which is that we are not this body. We are different from this body and are transmigrating from one body to another. Without this knowledge, all his theories are based on a misunderstanding.",
            "Not only Freud, but everyone in this material world is under illusion. In Bengal, a psychiatrist in the civil service was once called to give evidence in a case where the murderer was pleading insanity. The civil servant examined him to discover whether he actually was insane or whether he was simply under intense stress. In the courtroom he said, \u201cI have tested many persons, and I have concluded that everyone is insane to some degree. In the present case, if the defendant is pleading insanity, then you may acquit him if you like, but as far as I know, everyone is more or less insane.\u201d And that is our conclusion as well. Anyone who identifies with his material body must be crazy, for his life is based on a misconception.",

            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. Your desires must be frustrated because you desire something that is not permanent. Suppose I wish to live forever, but since I have accepted a material body, there is no question of living forever. Therefore I am always anxious that death will come. I am afraid of death, when the body will be destroyed. This is the cause of all anxiety: acceptance of something impermanent as permanent.",
            "\u015ay\u0101masundara:Freud says that anxiety develops when the superego represses the primitive desires of the id to protect the ego. Is such repression of basic instincts very healthy?",
            "\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da:Yes. For us repression means restraining oneself from doing something which, in the long run, is against one\u2019s welfare. For example, suppose you are suffering from diabetes and the doctor says, \u201cDon\u2019t eat any sweet food.\u201d If you desire to eat sweets, you must repress that desire. Similarly, in our system ofbrahmacaryathere is also repression. Abrahmac\u0101r\u012bshould not sit down with a young woman, or even see one. He may desire to see a young woman, but he must repress the desire. This is calledtapasya,or voluntary repression.",

If you keep children in good association, their psychological development will be very good\u00a0\u2013 they will become like demigods. But if you keep them in bad association, they will turn out to be demons. Children are a blank slate. You can mold them as you like, and they are eager to learn.",

However you put them into the mold, they will come out\u00a0\u2013 likebharats, cap\u0101t\u012bs,orkacaur\u012bs[types of Indian pastries].

By the process he called \u201cnatural selection,\u201d all the higher, complex forms of life gradually evolved from more primitive and rudimentary ones. In a given animal population, for example, some individuals will have traits that make them adapt better to their environment; these more fit individuals will survive to pass on their favorable traits to their offspring. The unfit will gradually be weeded out naturally. Thus a cold climate will favor those who have, say, long hair or fatty tissue, and the species will then gradually evolve in that direction.",

So the defect of the evolutionists is that they have no information of the soul. The soul is evolving, transmigrating, from one compartment to another compartment, simply changing place. ThePa\u1e0dma Pur\u0101\u1e47asays that there are 8,400,000 species of life, and the soul evolves through them.
