            "\u201cO descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body is eternal and can never be slain. Therefore you need not grieve for any creature.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.30)",
            "The very first step in self-realization is realizing one\u2019s identity as separate from the body. \u201cI am not this body but am spirit soul\u201d is an essential realization for anyone who wants to transcend death and enter into the spiritual world beyond. It is not simply a matter of saying \u201cI am not this body,\u201d but of actually realizing it. This is not as simple as it may seem at first. Although we are not these bodies but are pure consciousness, somehow or other we have become encased within the bodily dress. If we actually want the happiness and independence that transcend death, we have to establish ourselves and remain in our constitutional position as pure consciousness.",
            "Living in the bodily conception, our idea of happiness is like that of a man in delirium. Some philosophers claim that this delirious condition of bodily identification should be cured by abstaining from all action. Because these material activities have been a source of distress for us, they claim that we should actually stop these activities. Their culmination of perfection is in a kind of Buddhisticnirv\u0101\u1e47a,in which no activities are performed. Buddha maintained that due to a combination of material elements, this body has come into existence, and that somehow or other if these material elements are separated or dismantled, the cause of suffering is removed. If the tax collectors give us too much difficulty because we happen to possess a large house, one simple solution is to destroy the house. However, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101indicates that this material body is not all in all. Beyond this combination of material elements, there is spirit, and the symptom of that spirit is consciousness.",
            "Consciousness cannot be denied. A body without consciousness is a dead body. As soon as consciousness is removed from the body, the mouth will not speak, the eye will not see, nor the ears hear. A child can understand that. It is a fact that consciousness is absolutely necessary for the animation of the body. What is this consciousness? Just as heat or smoke are symptoms of fire, so consciousness is the symptom of the soul. The energy of the soul, or self, is produced in the shape of consciousness. Indeed, consciousness proves that the soul is present. This is not only the philosophy of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101but the conclusion of all Vedic literature.",
            "The impersonalist followers of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, as well as the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas following in the disciplic succession from Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, acknowledge the factual existence of the soul, but the Buddhist philosophers do not. The Buddhists contend that at a certain stage the combination of matter produces consciousness, but this argument is refuted by the fact that although we may have all the constituents of matter at our disposal, we cannot produce consciousness from them. All the material elements may be present in a dead man, but we cannot revive that man to consciousness. This body is not like a machine. When a part of a machine breaks down, it can be replaced, and the machine will work again, but when the body breaks down and consciousness leaves the body, there is no possibility of our replacing the broken part and rejuvenating the consciousness. The soul is different from the body, and as long as the soul is there, the body is animate. But there is no possibility of making the body animate in the absence of the soul.",
            "Because we cannot perceive the soul by our gross senses, we deny it. Actually there are so many things that are there which we cannot see. We cannot see air, radio waves, or sound, nor can we perceive minute bacteria with our blunt senses, but this does not mean they are not there. By the aid of the microscope and other instruments, many things can be perceived which had previously been denied by the imperfect senses. Just because the soul, which is atomic in size, has not been perceived yet by senses or instruments, we should not conclude that it is not there. It can, however, be perceived by its symptoms and effects.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that all of our miseries are due to false identification with the body.",
            "\u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of heat and cold, happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.14)",
            "In the summertime we may feel pleasure from contact with water, but in the winter we may shun that very water because it is too cold. In either case, the water is the same, but we perceive it as pleasant or painful due to its contact with the body.",
            "All feelings of distress and happiness are due to the body. Under certain conditions the body and mind feel happiness and distress. Factually we are hankering after happiness, for the soul\u2019s constitutional position is that of happiness. The soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Being, who issac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25\u2013 the embodiment of knowledge, bliss, and eternity. Indeed, the very nameK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,which is nonsectarian, means \u201cthe greatest pleasure.\u201dK\u1e5b\u1e63means \u201cgreatest\u201d and\u1e47ameans \u201cpleasure.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the epitome of pleasure, and being part and parcel of Him, we hanker for pleasure. A drop of ocean water has all the properties of the ocean itself, and we, although minute particles of the Supreme Whole, have the same energetic properties as the Supreme.",
            "The atomic soul, although so small, is moving the entire body to act in so many wonderful ways. In the world we see so many cities, highways, bridges, great buildings, monuments, and great civilizations, but who has done all this? It is all done by the minute spirit spark within the body. If such wonderful things can be performed by the minute spirit spark, we cannot begin to imagine what can be accomplished by the Supreme Spirit Whole. The natural hankering of the minute spirit spark is for the qualities of the whole \u2013 knowledge, bliss, and eternality \u2013 but these hankerings are being frustrated due to the material body. The information on how to attain the soul\u2019s desire is given in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "At present we are trying to attain eternity, bliss, and knowledge by means of an imperfect instrument. Actually, our progress toward these goals is being blocked by the material body; therefore we have to come to the realization of our existence beyond the body. Theoretical knowledge that we are not these bodies will not do. We have to keep ourselves always separate as masters of the body, not as servants. If we know how to drive a car well, it will give us good service; but if we do not know how, we will be in danger.",
            "The body is composed of senses, and the senses are always hungry after their objects. The eyes see a beautiful person and tell us, \u201cOh, there is a beautiful girl, a beautiful boy. Let\u2019s go see.\u201d The ears are telling us, \u201cOh, there is very nice music. Let us go hear it.\u201d The tongue is saying, \u201cOh, there is a very nice restaurant with palatable dishes. Let us go.\u201d In this way the senses are dragging us from one place to another, and because of this we are perplexed.",
            "\u201cAs a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man\u2019s intelligence.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.67)",
            "It is imperative that we learn how to control the senses. The namegosv\u0101m\u012bis given to someone who has learned how to master the senses.Gomeans \u201csenses,\u201d andsv\u0101m\u012bmeans \u201ccontroller\u201d; so one who can control the senses is to be considered agosv\u0101m\u012b.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that one who identifies with the illusory material body cannot establish himself in his proper identity as spirit soul. Bodily pleasure is flickering and intoxicating, and we cannot actually enjoy it, because of its momentary nature. Actual pleasure is of the soul, not the body. We have to mold our lives in such a way that we will not be diverted by bodily pleasure. If somehow we are diverted, it is not possible for us to establish our consciousness in its true identity beyond the body.",
            "\u201cIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place. TheVedasdeal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.44\u201345)",
            "The wordvedameans \u201cbook of knowledge.\u201d There are many books of knowledge, which vary according to the country, population, environment, etc. In India the books of knowledge are referred to as theVedas.In the West they are called the Old Testament and New Testament. The Muhammadans accept the Koran. What is the purpose for all these books of knowledge? They are to train us to understand our position as pure soul. Their purpose is to restrict bodily activities by certain rules and regulations, and these rules and regulations are known as codes of morality. The Bible, for instance, has ten commandments intended to regulate our lives. The body must be controlled in order for us to reach the highest perfection, and without regulative principles, it is not possible to perfect our lives. The regulative principles may differ from country to country or from scripture to scripture, but that doesn\u2019t matter, for they are made according to the time and circumstances and the mentality of the people. But the principle of regulated control is the same. Similarly, the government sets down certain regulations to be obeyed by its citizens. There is no possibility of making advancement in government or civilization without some regulations. In the previous verse, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that the regulative principles of theVedasare meant to control the three modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance (traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101\u1e25). However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is advising Arjuna to establish himself in his pure constitutional position as spirit soul, beyond the dualities of material nature.",
            "As we have already pointed out, these dualities \u2013 such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain \u2013 arise due to the contact of the senses with their objects. In other words, they are born of identification with the body. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that those who are devoted to enjoyment and power are carried away by the words of theVedas,which promise heavenly enjoyment by sacrifice and regulated activity. Enjoyment is our birthright, for it is the characteristic of the spirit soul, but the spirit soul tries to enjoy materially, and this is the mistake.",
            "Everyone is turning to material subjects for enjoyment and is compiling as much knowledge as possible. Someone is becoming a chemist, physicist, politician, artist, or whatever. Everyone knows something of everything or everything of something, and this is generally known as knowledge. But as soon as we leave the body, all of this knowledge is vanquished. In a previous life one may have been a great man of knowledge, but in this life he has to start again by going to school and learning how to read and write from the beginning. Whatever knowledge was acquired in the previous life is forgotten. The situation is that we are actually seeking eternal knowledge, but this cannot be acquired by this material body. We are all seeking enjoyment through these bodies, but bodily enjoyment is not our actual enjoyment. It is artificial. We have to understand that if we want to continue in this artificial enjoyment, we will not be able to attain our position of eternal enjoyment.",
            "The body must be considered a diseased condition. A diseased man cannot enjoy himself properly; a man with jaundice, for instance, will taste sugar candy as bitter, but a healthy man can taste its sweetness. In either case, the sugar candy is the same, but according to our condition it tastes different. Unless we are cured of this diseased conception of bodily life, we cannot taste the sweetness of spiritual life. Indeed, it will taste bitter to us. At the same time, by increasing our enjoyment of material life, we are further complicating our diseased condition. A typhoid patient cannot eat solid food, and if someone gives it to him to enjoy, and he eats it, he is further complicating his malady and is endangering his life. If we really want freedom from the miseries of material existence, we must minimize our bodily demands and pleasures.",
            "Actually, material enjoyment is not enjoyment at all. Real enjoyment does not cease. In theMah\u0101bh\u0101ratathere is a verse \u2013ramante yogino \u2019nante \u2013to the effect that theyog\u012bs(yogino), those who are endeavoring to elevate themselves to the spiritual platform, are actually enjoying (ramante), but their enjoyment isanante,endless. This is because their enjoyment is in relation to the supreme enjoyer (R\u0101ma), \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Bhagav\u0101n \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the real enjoyer, and theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(5.29)confirms this:",
            "\u201cThe sages, knowing Me as the ultimate enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d",
            "Bhogameans \u201cenjoyment,\u201d and our enjoyment comes from understanding our position as the enjoyed. The real enjoyer is the Supreme Lord, and we are enjoyed by Him.",
            "An example of this relationship can be found in the material world between the husband and the wife: the husband is the enjoyer (puru\u1e63a), and the wife is the enjoyed (prak\u1e5bti). The wordprimeans \u201cwoman.\u201dPuru\u1e63a,or spirit, is the subject, andprak\u1e5bti,or nature, is the object. The enjoyment, however, is participated in both by the husband and the wife. When actual enjoyment is there, there is no distinction that the husband is enjoying more or the wife is enjoying less. Although the male is the predominator and the female is the predominated, there is no division when it comes to enjoyment. On a larger scale, no living entity is the enjoyer.",
            "God expanded into many, and we constitute those expansions. God is one without a second, but He willed to become many in order to enjoy. We have experience that there is little or no enjoyment in sitting alone in a room talking to oneself. However, if there are five people present, our enjoyment is enhanced, and if we can discuss K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before many, many people, the enjoyment is all the greater. Enjoyment means variety. God became many for His enjoyment, and thus our position is that of the enjoyed. That is our constitutional position and the purpose for our creation. Both enjoyer and enjoyed have consciousness, but the consciousness of the enjoyed is subordinate to the consciousness of the enjoyer. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the enjoyer and we the enjoyed, the enjoyment can be participated in equally by everyone. Our enjoyment can be perfected when we participate in the enjoyment of God. There is no possibility of our enjoying separately on the bodily platform. Material enjoyment on the gross bodily platform is discouraged throughout theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "\u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of heat and cold, happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.14)",

            "To establish ourselves on the purebrahma-bh\u016btaspiritual platform, above the three modes, we must take up the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

On higher planets, the duration of life may be longer than on this earth, but death is there nonetheless. By \u201cmaterial universe\u201d we refer to those planets where birth, old age, disease, and death reside, and by \u201cspiritual universe\u201d we refer to those planets where there is no birth, old age, disease, and death. Those who are intelligent do not try to elevate themselves to any planet within the material universe.",
            "If one tries to enter higher planets by mechanical means, instant death is assured, for the body cannot stand the radical changes in atmosphere. But if one attempts to go to higher planets by means of the yoga system, he will acquire a suitable body for entrance. We can see this demonstrated on this earth, for we know it is not possible for us to live in the sea, in a watery atmosphere, nor is it possible for aquatics to live on the earth. As we understand that even on this planet one has to have a particular type of body to live in a particular place, so a particular type of body is required for other planets. On the higher planets, bodies live much longer than on earth, for six months on earth is equal to one day on the higher planets. Thus theVedasdescribe that those who live on higher planets live upward to ten thousand earth years. Yet despite such a long life span, death awaits everyone. Even if one lives twenty thousand or fifty thousand or even millions of years, in the material world the years are all counted, and death is there. How can we escape this subjugation by death? That is the lesson of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

Those who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are very intelligent, because they are not interested in gaining entrance to any planet where there is death.

Having attained this, theyog\u012bcan transfer himself to any planet in the material world according to his desire. If theyog\u012bis curious to know what the moon is like, he can transfer himself there, or if he is interested in higher planets, he can transfer himself there, just as travelers go to New York, Canada, or other cities on the earth. Wherever one goes on earth, he finds the same visa and customs systems operating, and on all the material planets one can similarly see the principles of birth, old age, disease, and death operating.",

It is the process of yoga to concentrate the mind on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The impersonalists imagine some form of the Supreme Lord, but the personalists do not imagine this; they actually see. Whether one imagines Him or actually sees Him, one has to concentrate his mind on the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "\u201cFor one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.14)",
            "Those who are satisfied with temporary life, temporary pleasure, and temporary facilities are not to be considered intelligent, at least not according to theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.According to theG\u012bt\u0101,one whose brain substance is very small is interested in temporary things. We are eternal, so why should we be interested in temporary things? No one wants a nonpermanent situation. If we are living in an apartment and the landlord asks us to vacate, we are sorry, but we are not sorry if we move into a better apartment. It is our nature, because we are permanent, to want a permanent residence. We don\u2019t wish to die, because in actuality we are permanent. Nor do we want to grow old or be diseased, because these are all external or nonpermanent states. Although we are not meant to suffer from fever, sometimes fever comes, and we have to take precautions and remedies to get well again. The fourfold miseries are like a fever, and they are all due to the material body. If somehow we can get out of the material body, we can escape the miseries that are integral with it.",
            "For the impersonalists to get out of this temporary body, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here advises that they vibrate the syllableo\u1e41.In this way they can be assured of transmigration into the spiritual world. However, although they may enter the spiritual world, they cannot enter into any of the planets there. They remain outside, in thebrahmajyoti.Thebrahmajyotimay be compared to the sunshine, and the spiritual planets may be compared to the sun itself. In the spiritual sky the impersonalists remain in the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, thebrahmajyoti.The impersonalists are placed in thebrahmajyotias spiritual sparks, and in this way thebrahmajyotiis filled with spiritual sparks. This is what is meant by merging into the spiritual existence. It should not be considered that one merges into thebrahmajyotiin the sense of becoming one with it; the individuality of the spiritual spark is retained, but because the impersonalist does not want to take a personal form, he is found as a spiritual spark in that effulgence. Just as the sunshine is composed of so many atomic particles, so thebrahmajyotiis composed of so many spiritual sparks.",
            "However, as living entities we want enjoyment. Being, in itself, is not enough. We want bliss (\u0101nanda) as well as being (sat). In his entirety, the living entity is composed of three qualities \u2013 eternality, knowledge, and bliss. Those who enter impersonally into thebrahmajyotican remain there for some time in full knowledge that they are now merged homogeneously with Brahman, but they cannot have that eternal\u0101nanda,bliss, because that part is wanting. One may remain alone in a room for some time and may enjoy himself by reading a book or engaging in some thought, but it is not possible to remain in that room for years and years at a time, and certainly not for all eternity. Therefore, for one who merges impersonally into the existence of the Supreme, there is every chance of falling down again into the material world in order to acquire some association. This is the verdict of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Astronauts may travel thousands and thousands of miles, but if they do not find rest on some planet, they have to return again to earth. In any case, rest is required. In the impersonal form, rest is uncertain. Therefore\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamsays that even after so much endeavor, if the impersonalist enters into the spiritual world and acquires an impersonal form, he returns again into the material world because of neglecting to serve the Supreme Lord in love and devotion. As long as we are here on earth, we must learn to practice to love and serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord. If we learn this, we can enter into those spiritual planets. The impersonalist\u2019s position in the spiritual world is nonpermanent, for out of loneliness he will attempt to acquire some association. Because he does not associate personally with the Supreme Lord, he has to return again to the world and associate with conditioned living entities there.",
            "It is of utmost importance, therefore, that we know the nature of our constitutional position: we want eternity, complete knowledge, and also pleasure. When we are left alone for a long time in the impersonalbrahmajyoti,we cannot have pleasure, and therefore we accept the pleasure given by the material world. But in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, real pleasure is enjoyed. In the material world it is generally accepted that the highest pleasure is sex. This is a perverted reflection of the sex pleasure in the spiritual world, the pleasure of association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But we should not think that the pleasure there is like the sex pleasure in the material world. No, it is different. But unless sex life is there in the spiritual world, it cannot be reflected here. Here it is simply a perverted reflection, but the actual life is there in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is full of all pleasure. Therefore, the best process is to train ourselves now, so that at the time of death we may transfer ourselves to the spiritual universe, to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, and there associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. InBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101(5.29) \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His abode are described thus:",
            "\u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, fulfilling all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of wish-fulfilling trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands oflak\u1e63m\u012bs,orgop\u012bs.\u201d",
            "This is a description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. The houses are made of what is called \u201ctouchstone.\u201d Whatever touchstone touches immediately turns into gold. The trees are wish-fulfilling trees, or \u201cdesire trees,\u201d for one can receive from them whatever he wishes. In this world we get mangoes from mango trees and apples from apple trees, but there from any tree one can get whatever he desires. Similarly, the cows are calledsurabhi,and they yield an endless supply of milk. These are descriptions of the spiritual planets found in Vedic scriptures.",
            "In this material world we have become acclimatized to birth, death, and all sorts of suffering. Material scientists have discovered many facilities for sense enjoyment and destruction, but they have discovered no solution to the problems of old age, disease, and death. They cannot make any machine that will check death, old age, or disease. We can manufacture something that will accelerate death, but nothing that will stop death. Those who are intelligent, however, are not concerned with the fourfold miseries of material life, but with elevation to the spiritual planets. One who is continuously in trance (nitya-yuktasya yogina\u1e25) does not divert his attention to anything else. He is always situated in trance. His mind is always filled with the thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without deviation (ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25 satatam).Satatamrefers to anywhere and any time.",
            "In India I lived in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and now I am in America, but this does not mean that I am out of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, because if I think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, then I\u2019m always in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, regardless of the material designation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means that one always lives with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on that spiritual planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and that one is simply waiting to give up this material body.Smarati nitya\u015ba\u1e25means \u201ccontinuously remembering,\u201d and for one who is continuously remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord becomestasy\u0101ha\u1e41 sulabha\u1e25 \u2013easily purchased. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself says that He is easily purchased by thisbhakti-yogaprocess. Then why should we take to any other process? We can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare twenty-four hours daily.

            "Thej\u00f1\u0101n\u012bsandyog\u012bsare generally impersonalists, and although they attain the temporary form of liberation by merging into the impersonal effulgence, the spiritual sky, according to\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamtheir knowledge is not considered pure. By penances, austerities, and meditations they can rise up to the platform of the Supreme Absolute, but as has been explained, they again fall down to the material world, because they have not taken K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal features seriously. Unless one worships the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he again has to descend to the material platform. The ideal attitude should be, \u201cI am Your eternal servitor. Please let me somehow engage in Your service.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is calledajita\u1e25 \u2013unconquerable \u2013 for no one can conquer God, but according to\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,one with this attitude easily conquers the Supreme.\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamalso recommends that we give up this futile process to measure the Supreme. We cannot even measure the limitations of space, what to speak of the Supreme. It is not possible to measure the length and breadth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by one\u2019s minuscule knowledge, and one who arrives at this conclusion is considered intelligent by Vedic literature. One should come to understand, submissively, that he is a very insignificant segment of the universe. Abandoning the endeavor to understand the Supreme by limited knowledge or mental speculation, we should become submissive and hear of the Supreme through authoritative sources such as theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101or through the lips of a realized soul.",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101Arjuna is hearing about God from the lips of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. In this way Arjuna set the criterion for understanding the Supreme by submissive hearing. It is our position to hear theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101from the lips of Arjuna or his bona fide representative, the spiritual master. After hearing, it is necessary to practice this acquired knowledge in daily life. \u201cMy dear Lord, You are unconquerable,\u201d the devotee prays, \u201cbut by this process, by hearing, You are conquered.\u201d God is unconquerable, but He is conquered by the devotee who abandons mental speculation and listens to authoritative sources.",
            "According to theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101there are two ways of acquiring knowledge \u2013 the ascending process and the descending process. By the ascending process one is elevated by knowledge acquired by himself. In this way one thinks, \u201cI don\u2019t care for any authorities or books. I will attain knowledge myself by meditation, philosophy, etc. In this way I will understand God.\u201d The other process, the descending process, involves receiving knowledge from higher authorities. TheBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101states that if one takes to the ascending process and travels at the speed of mind and wind for millions of years, he will still end up not knowing. For him, the subject matter will remain elusive and inconceivable. But that subject matter is given in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to meditate on Him without deviation from the path of devotional service in submission. For one who worships Him in this way \u2013tasy\u0101ha\u1e41 sulabha\u1e25:\u201cI become easily available.\u201d This is the process: if one works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot forget him. By becoming submissive, he can attract the attention of God. As Guru Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b used to say, \u201cDon\u2019t try to see God. Is God to come and stand before us like a servant just because we want to see Him? That is not the submissive way. We have to oblige Him by our love and service.\u201d",
            "The proper process for approaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was given to humanity by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, His first disciple, appreciated it. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a minister in the Muhammadan government, but he left the government to become a disciple of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. When he first went to see the Lord, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b approached Him with the following verse:",
            "\u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya, who is more magnanimous than any otheravat\u0101ra,even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, because He is bestowing freely what no one else has ever given \u2013 pure love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d",
            "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b called Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu \u201cthe most munificent, the most charitable personality,\u201d because He was offering the most precious thing of all very cheaply \u2013 love of God. We all want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and are all hankering after Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most attractive, the most beautiful, the most opulent, the most powerful, and the most learned. That is the object of our hankering. We\u2019re hankering after the beautiful, the powerful, the learned, the wealthy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all of this, so we need only turn our attention toward Him, and we will get everything. Everything \u2013 whatever we want. Whatever is our heart\u2019s desire will be fulfilled by this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "For one who dies in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as stated before, entrance into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, the supreme abode where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resides, is guaranteed. At this point one may ask what the advantage is in going to that planet, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself answers,",
            "\u201cAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who areyog\u012bsin devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.15)",
            "This material world is certified by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the creator, asdu\u1e25kh\u0101layam \u2013full of miseries. How then can we make it comfortable? Is it possible to make this world comfortable by the so-called advancement of science? No, this is not possible. As a result, we do not even wish to know what these miseries are. The miseries, as stated before, are birth, old age, disease, and death, and because we cannot make a solution to them, we try to set them aside. Science has no power to solve these miseries that are always giving us trouble. Instead, they divert our attention to the making of spaceships or atomic bombs. The solution to these problems is given here in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:if one attains to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s platform he does not have to return again to this earth of birth and death. We should try to understand that this place is full of miseries. It takes a certain amount of developed consciousness to understand this. Cats and dogs and hogs cannot understand that they are suffering. Man is called a rational animal, but his rationality is being used to further his animalistic propensities instead of to find out how to get liberation from this miserable condition. Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly states that one who comes to Him will never be reborn to suffer miseries again. Those great souls who come to Him have attained the highest perfection of life, which alleviates the living entity from the suffering of conditioned existence.",
            "One of the differences between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and an ordinary being is that an ordinary entity can be in only one place at a time, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be everywhere in the universe and yet also in His own abode, simultaneously. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the transcendental kingdom is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in India is that same V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana descended on this earth. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends Himself by His own internal potency, Hisdh\u0101ma,or abode, also descends. In other words, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends on this earth, He manifests Himself in that particular land. Despite this, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode remains eternally in the transcendental sphere, in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. In this verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims that one who comes to His abode in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas never has to take birth again in the material world. Such a person is called amah\u0101tm\u0101.The wordmah\u0101tm\u0101is generally heard in the West in connection with Mahatma Gandhi, but we should understand thatmah\u0101tm\u0101is not the title of a politician. Rather,mah\u0101tm\u0101refers to the first-class K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man who is eligible to enter into the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Themah\u0101tm\u0101\u2019sperfection is this: to utilize the human form of life and the resources of nature to extricate himself from the cycle of birth and death.",
            "An intelligent person knows that he does not want miseries, but they are inflicted upon him by force. As stated before, we are always in a miserable condition due to this mind, body, natural disturbances, or other living entities. There is always some kind of misery inflicted upon us. This material world is meant for misery; unless the misery is there, we cannot come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Miseries are actually an impetus and help to elevate us to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. An intelligent man questions why these miseries are inflicted on him by force. However, modern civilization\u2019s attitude is, \u201cLet me suffer. Let me cover it by some intoxication, that\u2019s all.\u201d But as soon as the intoxication is over, the miseries return. It is not possible to make a solution to the miseries of life by artificial intoxication. The solution is made by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "One may point out that although the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are trying to enter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet, everyone else is interested in going to the moon. Isn\u2019t going to the moon also perfection? The tendency to travel to other planets is always present in the living entity. One name for the living entity issarva-gata,which means \u201cone who wants to travel everywhere.\u201d Travel is part of the nature of the living entity. The desire to go to the moon is not a new thing. Theyog\u012bsalso are interested in entering the higher planets, but in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.16)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that this will not be of any help.",
            "\u201cFrom the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunt\u012b, never takes birth again.\u201d",
            "The universe is divided into higher, middle, and lower planetary systems. The earth is considered to be a member of the middle planetary system. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that even if one enters into the highest planet of all, called Brahmaloka, there is still repetition of birth and death. Other planets in the universe are full of living entities. We should not think that we are here and that all the other planets are vacant. From experience we can see that no place on earth is vacant of living entities. If we dig deep down into the earth, we find worms; if we go deep into the water, we find aquatics; if we go into the sky, we find so many birds. How is it possible to conclude that other planets have no living entities? But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that even if we enter into those planets where great demigods reside, we will still be subjected to death. Again, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a repeats that upon reaching His planet, one need not take birth again.",
            "We should be very serious about attaining our eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. We have forgotten that this is actually our aim of life, our real self-interest. Why have we forgotten? We have simply been entrapped by the material glitter, by skyscrapers, big factories, and political play, although we know that however big we build skyscrapers, we will not be able to live here indefinitely. We should not spoil our energy in building mighty industries and cities to further entrap ourselves in material nature; rather, our energy should be used to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in order to attain a spiritual body whereby we may enter into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not a religious formula or some spiritual recreation; it is the most important part of the living entity."

            "\u201cWhen Brahm\u0101\u2019s day is manifest, this multitude of living entities comes into being, and at the arrival of Brahm\u0101\u2019s night, they are all annihilated.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.18)",
            "At the end of the day of Brahm\u0101, all the lower planetary systems are covered with water, and the beings on them are annihilated. After this devastation and after the night of Brahm\u0101 passes, in the morning when Brahm\u0101 arises there is again creation, and all these beings come forth. Thus subjection to creation and destruction is the nature of the material world.",

            "Although the living entities do not like devastation, that devastation will come and overflood the planets until all living beings on the planets stay merged in water throughout the night of Brahm\u0101. But as day comes, the water gradually disappears.",
            "\u201cYet there is another nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.20)",
            "We cannot calculate the extent of the material universe, but we have Vedic information that there are millions of universes within the entire creation, and beyond these material universes there is another sky, which is spiritual. There all the planets are eternal, and the lives of all the beings on them are eternal. In this verse the wordbh\u0101va\u1e25means \u201cnature,\u201d and here another nature is indicated. In this world we have experience also of two natures. The living entity is spirit, and as long as he is within matter, matter is moving, and as soon as the living entity, the spiritual spark, is out of the body, the body is immovable. The spiritual nature is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s superior nature, and the material is called the inferior. Beyond this material nature there is a superior nature, which is totally spiritual. It is not possible to understand this by experimental knowledge. We can see millions and millions of stars through a telescope, but we cannot approach them. We have to understand our incapabilities. If we cannot understand the material universe by experimental knowledge, what is the possibility of understanding God and His kingdom? It is not possible experimentally. We have to understand by hearing theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.We cannot understand who our father is by experimental knowledge; we have to hear the word of our mother and believe her. If we do not believe her, there is no way of knowing. Similarly, if we just stick to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious method, all information about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His kingdom will be revealed.",
            "Paras tu bh\u0101va\u1e25means \u201csuperior nature,\u201d andvyakta\u1e25refers to what we see manifested. We can see that the material universe is manifested through the earth, sun, stars, and planets. And beyond this universe is another nature, an eternal nature.Avyakt\u0101t san\u0101tana\u1e25.This material nature has a beginning and an end, but that spiritual nature issan\u0101tana\u1e25 \u2013eternal. It has neither beginning nor end. How is this possible? A cloud may pass over the sky, and it may appear to cover a great distance, but actually it is only a small speck covering an insignificant part of the whole sky. Because we are so small, if only a few hundred miles is covered by cloud, it appears that the whole sky is covered. Similarly, this whole material universe is like a small, insignificant cloud in the vast spiritual sky. It is encased by themahat-tattva,matter. As a cloud has a beginning and an end, this material nature also has a beginning and an end. When the clouds disappear and the sky clears, we see everything as it is. Similarly, the body is like a cloud passing over the spirit soul. It stays for some time, gives some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Any kind of material phenomenon that we observe is subject to these six transformations of material nature \u2013 it comes into being, grows, stays for a while, produces some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that beyond this changing, cloudlike nature there is a spiritual nature, which is eternal. In addition, when this material nature is annihilated, thatavyakt\u0101t san\u0101tana\u1e25will remain.",
            "In Vedic literatures there is a good deal of information about the material and spiritual skies. In the Second Canto of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere are descriptions of the spiritual sky and of its inhabitants. There is even information given that there are spiritual airplanes in the spiritual sky and that the liberated entities there travel about on these planes like lightning. Everything that we find here can also be found there in reality. Here in the material sky everything is an imitation, or shadow, of that which exists in the spiritual sky. As in a cinema we simply see a show or facsimile of the real thing, in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that this material world is but a combination of matter modeled after the reality, just as a mannequin of a girl in a store window is modeled after a girl. Every sane man knows that the mannequin is an imitation. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says that because the spiritual world is real, this material world, which is an imitation,appearsto be real. We must understand the meaning of reality \u2013 reality means existence which cannot be vanquished; reality means eternity.",

            "Real pleasure is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas material pleasure, which is temporary, is not actual. Those who can see things as they are do not take part in shadow pleasure. The real aim of human life is to attain to the spiritual sky, but as\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatampoints out, most people do not know about it. Human life is meant to understand reality and to be transferred into it. All Vedic literature instructs us not to remain in this darkness. The nature of this material world is darkness, but the spiritual world is full of light and yet is not illumined by fire or electricity. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a hints of this in the fifteenth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(15.6):",
            "\u201cThat abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One who reaches it never returns to this material world.\u201d",

We have to be able to penetrate outer space, traverse the material universe, penetrate its covering, and enter the spiritual sky.Param\u0101\u1e41 gatim \u2013that journey is supreme. There is no question of going a few thousand miles away from this planet and then returning. This sort of journey is not very heroic. We have to penetrate the whole material universe. This we cannot do by spaceships but by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and who at the time of death thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is at once transferred there. If we at all want to go to that spiritual sky and cultivate eternal, blissful life, full of knowledge, we will have to begin now to cultivate asac-cid-\u0101nandabody. It is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has asac-cid-\u0101nandabody \u2013\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25\u2013 and we also have a similar body of eternity, knowledge, and bliss, but it is very small and is covered by the dress of matter. If somehow or other we are able to give up this false dress, we can reach that spiritual kingdom. If once we can attain that spiritual world, return is not necessary (ya\u1e41 pr\u0101pya na nivartante).",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself comes to call us, and He gives us literatures as guidebooks and sends His bona fide representatives. We should take advantage of this facility given to human life. For one who reaches that supreme abode, penances, austerities, yogic meditations, and so on are no longer required, and for one who does not reach it, all penances and austerities are a useless waste of time. The human form of life is an opportunity to get this boon, and it is the duty of the state, parents, teachers, and guardians to elevate those who have acquired this human form of life to attain this perfection of life. Simply eating, sleeping, mating, and quarreling like cats and dogs is not civilization. We should properly utilize this human form of life and take advantage of this knowledge to prepare ourselves in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, so that twenty-four hours of the day we will be absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at death at once transfer to that spiritual sky.",

Bhaktiis realizing that one is pure spirit and not matter at all. Our real identity is not this body, which is simply a covering of the spirit, but our real identity isd\u0101sa,servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Of course, one who goes to God for material gain is better than one who never goes, but we should be free from desire for material benefit. Our aim should be to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Of course K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is unlimited, and it is not possible to understand Him, but we have to accept what we can understand.

We cannot see God by our own endeavor, but if we qualify ourselves, God will reveal Himself, and then we will see. No one can order God to come before him and dance, but we do have to work in such a way that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be pleased to reveal Himself to us.",

There is no preliminary qualification necessary for the understanding of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,because it is spoken from the absolute platform. The simple process of chanting the names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will reveal what one is, what God is, what the material and spiritual universes are, why we are conditioned, how we can get out of that conditioning \u2013 and everything else, step by step. Actually, the process of belief and revelation is not foreign to us. Every day we place faith in something that we have confidence will be revealed later. We may purchase a ticket to go to India, and on the basis of the ticket we have faith that we will be transported there. Why should we pay money for a ticket? We do not just give the money to anyone. The company is authorized and the airline is authorized, so faith is created. Without faith we cannot take one step forward in the ordinary course of our life. Faith we must have, but it must be faith in that which is authorized. It is not that we have blind faith, but that we accept something that is recognized. TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is recognized and accepted as scripture by all classes of men in India, and as far as outside India is concerned, many scholars, theologians, and philosophers accept theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as a great, authoritative work.

If we heard of such a place, surely we would try as hard as possible to go there. No one wants to grow old; no one wants to die. Indeed, a place free of such sufferings would be our heart\u2019s desire. Why do we want this? Because we have the right, the prerogative, to want it. We are eternal, blissful, and full of knowledge, but having been covered by this material entanglement, we have forgotten ourselves. Therefore theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101gives us the advantage of being able to revive our original status.",

The philosophy of voidness has simply created atheists. We are spiritual beings, and we want enjoyment, but as soon as our future is void, we will become inclined to enjoy this material life. In this way, the impersonalists discuss the philosophy of voidism while trying as much as possible to enjoy this material life. One may enjoy speculation in this way, but there is no spiritual benefit.",

We want enjoyment, but impersonalism and voidism have created such an atmosphere that we have become addicted to material enjoyment. There must be enjoyment in connection with the Supreme Person (puru\u1e63a\u1e25 sa para\u1e25), whom we can see face to face. In the spiritual sky we are able to speak personally with God, play with Him, eat with Him, etc. All of this can be attained bybhakty\u0101 \u2013transcendental loving service. However, this service must be without adulteration, that is to say, we must love God without expecting material remuneration. Loving God to become one with Him is also a form of adulteration.",
            "One of the major differences between the spiritual sky and the material sky is that in the spiritual sky the head or leader of the spiritual planets has no rival. In all cases, the predominating personality in the spiritual planets is a plenary expansion of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supreme Lord and His multifarious manifestations preside over all the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. On earth, for instance, there is rivalry for the position of president or prime minister, but in the spiritual sky everyone acknowledges the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be supreme. Those who do not acknowledge Him and attempt to rival Him are placed into the material universe, which is just like a prison house. As in any city there is a prison, and the prison forms a very insignificant part of the whole city, so the material universe is a prison for the conditioned souls. It forms an insignificant part of the spiritual sky, but it is not outside the spiritual sky, just as a prison is not outside of the city.",
            "The inhabitants of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets in the spiritual sky are all liberated souls. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe are informed that their bodily features are exactly like God\u2019s. On some of these planets God is manifested with two arms, and on others He has four. The inhabitants of these planets, like the Supreme Lord, also manifest two and four arms, and it is said that one cannot distinguish between them and the Supreme Person. In the spiritual world there are five kinds of liberation.S\u0101yujya-muktiis a form of liberation in which one merges into the impersonal existence of the Supreme Lord, called Brahman. Another form of liberation iss\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti,by which one receives features exactly like God\u2019s. Another iss\u0101lokya-mukti,by which one can live in the same planet with God. Bys\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di-muktione can have opulences similar to the Supreme Lord\u2019s. Another type enables one to remain always with God as one of His associates, just like Arjuna, who is always with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His friend. One can have any of these five forms of liberation, but of the five thes\u0101yujya-mukti,merging with the impersonal aspect, is not accepted by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava wishes to worship God as He is and retain his separate individuality to serve Him, whereas the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonal philosopher wishes to lose his individuality and merge into the existence of the Supreme. This merging is recommended neither by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101nor by the disciplic succession of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wrote on this subject in His\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka(4):",
            "\u201cO almighty Lord! I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor have I any desire to enjoy beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is that I may have Your causeless devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d",
            "Here Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu refers to \u201cbirth after birth.\u201d When there is birth after birth, there is no liberation. In liberation one either attains the spiritual planets or merges into the existence of the Supreme \u2013 in either case, there is no question of rebirth into the material world. But Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu doesn\u2019t care whether He is liberated or not: His only concern is to be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to serve the Supreme Lord. The devotee doesn\u2019t care where he is, nor does he care whether he is born in the animal society, human society, demigod society, or whatever \u2013 he only prays to God that he not forget Him and that he always be able to engage in His transcendental service. These are symptoms of pure devotion. Of course, a devotee, wherever he is, remains in the spiritual kingdom, even while in this material body. But he does not demand anything from God for his own personal elevation or comfort.",
            "Although \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that He can be easily reached by one who is devoted to Him, there is an element of risk involved for theyog\u012bswho practice other methods of yoga. For them, He has given directions in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.23)regarding the proper time to leave the gross body.",
            "\u201cO best of the Bh\u0101ratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, one does or does not come back.\u201d",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that if one is able to leave his body at a particular time, he can become liberated, never to return to the material world. On the other hand, he indicates that if one dies at another time, he has to return. There is this element of chance, but there is no question of chance for a devotee always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for he is guaranteed entrance into the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by dint of his devotion to the Lord.",
            "\u201cThose who know the Supreme Brahman pass away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment, during the fortnight of the moon and the six months when the sun travels in the north.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.24)",
            "The sun spends six months on the northern side of the equator and six months on the southern side. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe have information that as the planets are moving, so also the sun is moving. If one dies when the sun is situated in the northern hemisphere, he attains liberation.",
            "\u201cThe mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the moonless fortnight, or in the six months when the sun passes to the south, or who reaches the moon planet, again comes back. According to theVedas,there are two ways of passing from this world \u2013 one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.25\u201326)",
            "This is all by chance. We do not know when we are going to die, and we may die accidentally at any time. But for one who is abhakti-yog\u012b,who is established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no question of chance. He is always sure.",
            "\u201cThe devotees who know these two paths, O Arjuna, are never bewildered. Therefore, be always fixed in devotion.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.27)",
            "It has already been ascertained that at the time of death, if one can think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is immediately transferred to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "\u201cAnd whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P\u0101rtha [Arjuna], is sure to reach Me.\u201d (Bg. 8.5, 8.8)",
            "Such meditation on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may seem very difficult, but it is not. If one practices K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by chanting themah\u0101-mantra,Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, he will be quickly helped. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His name are nondifferent, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His transcendental abode are also nondifferent. By sound vibration we can have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a associate with us. If, for instance, we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the street, we will see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is going with us, just as when we look up and see the moon overhead, we perceive that it is also going with us. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inferior energy may appear to go with us, is it not possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself to be with us when we are chanting His names? He will keep us company, but we have to qualify to be in His company. If, however, we are always merged in the thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we should rest assured that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always with us. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prays,",
            "\u201cO my Lord! Your holy name alone can render all benediction upon the living beings, and therefore You have hundreds and millions of names, likeK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aandGovinda.In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies, and there is no hard and fast rule for chanting these holy names. O my Lord! You have so kindly made approach to You easy by Your holy names, but unfortunate as I am, I have no attraction for them.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka2)",
            "Merely by chanting we can have all the advantages of personal association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is not only considered to be a realized soul but an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, has pointed out that in this age of Kali, although men have no real facilities for self-realization, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that He has given this\u015babda(sound incarnation) to be utilized as theyuga-dharma,or way of realization of this age. No special qualification is necessary for this method; we need not even know Sanskrit. The vibrations of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so potent that anyone can immediately begin chanting them, without any knowledge of Sanskrit whatsoever.",
            "\u201cA person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying theVedas,performing austere sacrifices, giving charity, or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the supreme abode.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01018.28)",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that the purpose of all Vedic instructions is to achieve the ultimate goal of life \u2013 to go back to Godhead. All scriptures from all countries aim at this goal. This has also been the message of all religious reformers or\u0101c\u0101ryas.In the West, for example, Lord Jesus Christ spread this same message. Similarly, Lord Buddha and Muhammad. No one advises us to make our permanent settlement here in this material world. There may be small differences according to country, time, and circumstance, and according to scriptural injunction, but the main principle that we are not meant for this material world but for the spiritual world is accepted by all genuine transcendentalists. All indications for the satisfaction of our soul\u2019s innermost desires point to those worlds of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a beyond birth and death."
