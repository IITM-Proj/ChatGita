            "The opening words of the ninth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101indicate that the Supreme Godhead is speaking. Here \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as Bhagav\u0101n.Bhagameans \u201copulences,\u201d andv\u0101nmeans \u201cone who possesses.\u201d We have some conception of God, but in the Vedic literature there are definite descriptions and definitions of what is meant by God, and what is meant is described in one word \u2013 Bhagav\u0101n. Bhagav\u0101n possesses all opulences \u2013 the totality of knowledge, wealth, power, beauty, fame, and renunciation. When we find someone who possesses these opulences in full, we are to know that he is God. There are many rich, wise, famous, beautiful, and powerful men, but no one man can claim to possess all of these opulences. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a claims to possess them in totality.",

            "\u201cA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01015.29)",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims that He is the enjoyer of all activities and the proprietor of all planets (sarva-loka-mahe\u015b-varam). An individual may possess a large tract of land, and he may be proud of his ownership, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a claims to possess all planetary systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also claims to be the friend of all living entities (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). When a person understands that God is the proprietor of everything, the friend of everyone, and the enjoyer of all, he becomes very peaceful. This is the actual peace formula. No one can have peace as long as he thinks \u201cI am the proprietor.\u201d Who is capable of claiming proprietorship? Only a few hundred years ago the Native Indians were considered the proprietors of America. Today, we in our turn are claiming that proprietorship. But in four hundred or a thousand years, perhaps someone else will come to claim the same. The land is here, and we come here and falsely claim ourselves to be proprietors of it. This philosophy of false proprietorship is not in line with Vedic injunctions.\u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63adstates that \u201ceverything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord\u201d (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam). The truth of this statement is factual, but under illusion we are thinking that we are the proprietors. In actuality God owns everything, and therefore He is called the richest.",
            "Of course, there are many men who claim to be God. In India, for instance, at any time, one has no difficulty in finding at least one dozen people claiming to be God. But if you ask them if they are the proprietor of everything, they find this difficult to answer. This is a criterion by which we can understand who God is. God is the proprietor of everything, and, being so, He must be more powerful than anyone or anything else. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was personally present on this earth, no one could conquer Him. There is no record of His ever having lost a battle. He belonged to ak\u1e63atriya(warrior) family, and thek\u1e63atriyasare meant to give protection to the weak. As far as His opulence is concerned, He married 16,108 wives. Every wife had her own separate palace, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expanded Himself 16,108 times in order to enjoy them all. This may seem difficult to believe, but it is stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,and the great sages of India recognize this as scripture and recognize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as God.",
            "In the first verse of this ninth chapter, by the wordguhya-tamam,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a intimates that He is imparting the most confidential knowledge to Arjuna. Why is He proclaiming this to Arjuna? It is because Arjuna isanas\u016byu\u2013 nonenvious. In the material world if someone is greater than us, we are envious. We are not only envious of one another but of God. Also, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am the proprietor,\u201d we disbelieve it. But this is not the case with Arjuna, who listens to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without envy. Arjuna does not cavil with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but agrees with whatever He says. This is his special qualification, and this is the way of understanding theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.It is not possible to understand what God is by our own mental speculation; we have to hear, and we have to accept.",
            "Because Arjuna is not envious, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks this special knowledge to him. This is not only theoretical knowledge but practical knowledge (vij\u00f1\u0101na-sahitam). Whatever knowledge we receive from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101should not be taken for sentimentality or fanaticism. The knowledge is bothj\u00f1\u0101naandvij\u00f1\u0101na,theoretical wisdom and scientific knowledge. If one becomes well versed in this knowledge, liberation is certain. Life in this material world is by nature inauspicious and miserable.Mok\u1e63ameans liberation, and the promise is that by dint of understanding this knowledge one will attain liberation from all miseries. It is important then to understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says about this knowledge.",

            "\u201cThis knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01019.2)",
            "According to theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the topmost knowledge (r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101 r\u0101ja-guhyam) is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we find that the symptom of one who is actually in knowledge is that he has surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As long as we go on speculating about God but do not surrender, it is understood that we have not attained the perfection of knowledge. The perfection of knowledge is",

            "\u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01017.19)",
            "As long as we do not surrender, we cannot understand God. Surrender to God may take many births, but if we accept that God is great, it is possible to surrender unto Him immediately. But generally this is not our position in the material world. We are characteristically envious and consequently think, \u201cOh, why should I surrender to God? I am independent. I shall work independently.\u201d Therefore in order to rectify this misgiving, we have to work for many births. In this regard, the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is especially significant.K\u1e5b\u1e63means \u201crepetition of birth,\u201d and\u1e47ameans \u201cone who checks.\u201d Our repetition of birth can be checked only by God. No one can check his repetition of birth and death without the causeless mercy of God.",
            "The subject matter of the ninth chapter isr\u0101ja-vidy\u0101. R\u0101jameans \u201cking,\u201d andvidy\u0101means \u201cknowledge.\u201d In ordinary life we find one person king in one subject and another in another subject. This knowledge, however, is sovereign over all others, and all other knowledge is subject or relative to it. The wordr\u0101ja-guhyamindicates that this sovereign knowledge is very confidential, and the wordpavitrammeans that it is very pure. This knowledge is alsouttamam; udmeans \u201ctranscend,\u201d andtamameans \u201cdarkness,\u201d and that knowledge which surpasses this world and the knowledge of this world is calleduttamam. It is the knowledge of light, and darkness has been separated from it. If one follows this path of knowledge, he will personally understand how far he has progressed down the path of perfection (pratyak\u1e63\u0101vagama\u1e41 dharmyam).Su-sukha\u1e41 kartumindicates that this knowledge is very happy and joyful to execute. Andavyayamindicates that this knowledge is permanent. We may work in this material world for education or riches, but these things are notavyayam,for as soon as this body is finished, everything else is also finished. With death, our education, advanced degrees, bank balances, family \u2013 everything \u2013 are all finished. Whatever we\u2019re doing in this material world is not eternal. However, this knowledge is not like that.",

            "\u201cIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01012.40)",
            "Knowledge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so perfect that if one performs work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and yet does not attain perfection, in his next life he takes up from wherever he left off. In other words, actions performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are durable. On the other hand, material achievements, because they pertain to the body, are vanquished at death. Knowledge that pertains to designations does not endure. I am thinking that I am a man or a woman, an American or an Indian, a Christian or a Hindu \u2013 these are all designations pertaining to the body, and when the body is finished, they will also be finished. We are actually spirit, and therefore our spiritual activities will go with us wherever we go.",
            "\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that this king of knowledge is also happily performed. We can easily see that activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are joyfully done. There is chanting and dancing, eatingpras\u0101da(food that has been offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) and discussing theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. These are the main processes. There are no stringent rules and regulations that we have to sit so straight for so long or do so many gymnastics or control our breath. No, the process is very easily and happily done. Everyone wants to dance, to sing, to eat, and to hear the truth. This process is trulysu-sukham\u2013 very happy.",
            "In the material world there are so many gradations of education. Some people never finish grammar school or high school, whereas others go on and receive a university education, a BA, MA, PhD, and so on. But what is thisr\u0101ja-vidy\u0101,the king of education, thesummum bonumof knowledge? It is this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Real knowledge is understanding what I am. Unless we come to the point of understanding what we are, we cannot attain real knowledge. When San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b left his government post and came to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu for the first time, he asked the Lord, \u201cWhat is education?\u201d Although San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b knew a number of languages, including Sanskrit, he still inquired about real education. \u201cThe general populace calls me highly educated,\u201d San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b told the Lord, \u201cand I am such a fool that I actually believe them.\u201d",
            "The Lord replied, \u201cWhy should you not think you\u2019re well educated? You\u2019re a great scholar in Sanskrit and Persian.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat may be,\u201d San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b said, \u201cbut I do not know what I am.\u201d He then went on to tell the Lord: \u201cI do not wish to suffer, but these material miseries are forced on me. I neither know where I\u2019ve come from nor where I\u2019m going, but people are calling me educated. When they call me a great scholar, I am satisfied, but in truth I am such a great fool that I do not know what I am.\u201d San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b was actually speaking for all of us, for this is our present situation. We may be proud of our academic education, but if asked what we are, we are not able to say. Everyone is under the conception that this body is the self, but we learn from Vedic sources that this is not so. Only after realizing that we are not these bodies can we enter into real knowledge and understand what we actually are. This, then, is the beginning of knowledge.",
            "R\u0101ja-vidy\u0101may be further defined as not only knowing what one is but acting accordingly. If we do not know who we are, how can our activities be proper? If we are mistaken about our identity, we will also be mistaken about our activities. Simply knowing that we are not these material bodies is not sufficient; we must act according to the conviction that we are spiritual. Action based on this knowledge \u2013 spiritual activity \u2013 is work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This kind of knowledge may not seem to be so easily attainable, but it is made very easy by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who made this knowledge easily available through the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.",
            "Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu divided the living entities into two major categories: those that are moving and those that are not moving. Trees, grass, plants, stones, etc., do not move because they do not have sufficiently developed consciousness. Their consciousness is there, but it is cov-ered. If a living being does not understand his position, he is stonelike even if dwelling in a human body. The living entities \u2013 birds, reptiles, animals, insects, human beings, demigods, etc. \u2013 number over 8,000,000 species, and of these a very small number are human beings. Lord Caitanya further points out that out of 400,000 species of human beings, some are civilized; and out of many civil-ized persons, there are only a few who are devoted to the scriptures.",
            "In the present day most people claim to be devoted to some religion \u2013 Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, etc. \u2013 but in fact they do not really believe in the scriptures. Those who do believe in the scriptures are by and large attached to pious philanthropic activities. They believe that religion meansyaj\u00f1a(sacrifice),d\u0101na(charity), andtapas(penance). One who engages intapasyavoluntarily undertakes very rigid regulations like thosebrahmac\u0101r\u012bstudents (celibates) orsanny\u0101s\u012bs(renunciants) undertake. Charity means voluntarily giving away one\u2019s material possessions. In the present age there is no sacrifice, but from historical literatures like theMah\u0101bh\u0101ratawe get information that kings performed sacrifices by distributing rubies, gold, and silver.Yaj\u00f1awas primarily for kings, and charity, on a much smaller scale, was meant for householders. Those who actually believed in scriptures usually adopted some of these principles. But generally in this age people simply say they belong to a religion but in actuality do nothing. Out of millions of such people, a very small number actually perform charity, sacrifice, and penance. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu further points out that out of millions who perform such religious principles all over the universe, only a few attain perfect knowledge and understand what they are.",
            "Just knowing \u201cI am not this body; I am spirit soul\u201d is not sufficient. We have to escape this entanglement of material nature. This escape is calledmukti,liberation. Out of many thousands of persons who are in self-knowledge as to what and who they are, only one or two may actually be liberated. And out of many thousands who are liberated, only one or two may understand what and who K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. So understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not such an easy job. Thus in this Age of Kali, an age characterized by ignorance and chaos, liberation is out of the reach of practically everyone. One has to go through the whole ordeal of becoming civilized, then religious, and then one has to give charity and perform sacrifices and come to the platform of knowledge, then come to the stage of liberation, and finally, after liberation, come to the understanding of what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. This process is also indicated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:",
            "brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63atisama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63umad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m",
            "\u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service to Me.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010118.54)",
            "These are the signs of liberation. The first symptom of one who is liberated is that he is very happy. It is not possible to find him morose. Nor does he have any anxiety. He never frets, \u201cThis thing I don\u2019t have. Oh, I must secure this thing. Oh, this bill I have to pay. I have to go here, there.\u201d One who is liberated has no anxieties at all. He may be the poorest man in the world, but he neither laments nor thinks he is poor. Why should he think he is poor? When we think we are these material bodies and have possessions to go with them, then we think we are poor or rich, but one who is liberated from the material conception of life has nothing to do with possessions or lack of possessions. \u201cI have nothing to lose and nothing to gain,\u201d he thinks. \u201cI am completely separate from all this.\u201d Nor does he see anyone else as rich or poor, educated or uneducated, beautiful or ugly. He does not see any material dualities, for his vision is completely on the spiritual platform, and he sees that every living entity is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus seeing all entities in their true identity, he tries to take them back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. His viewpoint is that everyone \u2013 whether he bebr\u0101hma\u1e47aor\u015b\u016bdra,black or white, Hindu or Christian \u2013 should come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When one is situated in this way, then,mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m:he becomes eligible for becoming a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Practically speaking, this process is not very easy in this Age of Kali. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatama description is given of the people of this age. Their duration of life is said to be very short, they tend to be phlegmatic and slow and to sleep a great deal, and when they\u2019re not sleeping they are busy earning money. At most they only have two hours a day for spiritual activities, so what is the hope for spiritual understanding? It is also stated that even if they are anxious to make spiritual progress, there are many pseudospiritual societies to take advantage of them. People are also characterized in this age as being unfortunate. They have a great deal of difficulty meeting the primary demands of life \u2013 eating, defending, mating, and sleeping \u2013 necessities that are met even by the animals. Even if people are meeting these necessities in this age, they are always anxious about war, either defending themselves from aggressors or having to go to war themselves. In addition to this, there are always disturbing diseases and economic problems in Kali-yuga. Therefore Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that in this age it is impossible for people to come to the perfectional stage of liberation by following the prescribed rules and regulations.",
            "Thus out of His causeless mercy, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came as Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and distributed the means to the highest perfection of life and spiritual ecstasy by the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This process of chanting is most practical, and it does not depend on whether one is liberated or not, or whether one\u2019s condition is conducive to spiritual life or not \u2013 whoever takes to this process becomes immediately purified. Therefore it is calledpavitram(pure). Furthermore, for one who takes to this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious process, the seeds of latent reactions to his sinful actions are all nullified; just as a fire turns whatever we put into it to ashes, this process turns to ashes all the sinful reactions of our past lives.",
            "We must understand that our suffering is due to our sinful activity, and sinful activity is due to our ignorance. Sins, or transgressions, are committed by those who do not know what is what. A child, for instance, will naively put his hand in a fire because of ignorance. He is thus burned immediately, for the fire is impartial and does not allow any special consideration for the innocent child. It will simply act as fire. Similarly, we do not know how this material world is functioning, who its controller is, nor how it is controlled, and due to our ignorance we act in foolish ways, but nature is so stringent that she does not allow us to escape the reactions to our actions. Whether we commit an act knowingly or unknowingly, the reactions and consequent sufferings are there. However, through knowledge we can understand what the actual situation is, who God is, and what our relationship with Him is.",
            "This knowledge by which we can gain release from suffering is possible in the human form of life, not in the animal form. To give us knowledge, to give us proper direction, there are scriptures written in various languages in all parts of the world. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu pointed out that people are forgetful from time immemorial about their relationship with the Supreme Lord; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has sent so many representatives to impart the scriptures to humankind. We should take advantage of these, especially of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,which is the prime scripture for the modern world."

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically states that this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness issu-sukham,very pleasant and easy to practice. Indeed, the devotional process is very pleasant; we melodiously sing with instruments, and someone will listen and also join (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam). Of course, the music should be in relation with the Supreme Lord \u2013 in glorification of Him. Hearing theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is also part of devotional service, and in addition to hearing it one should be eager to apply it in his life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a science and should not be accepted blindly. There are nine processes of devotional service recommended: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, serving, engaging as a servitor of the Lord, establishing friendly relations with the Lord, and offering everything to the Lord. These are all easy to practice and should be joyfully performed.",
            "Of course, if one thinks that theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra are part of the Hindu system and doesn\u2019t want to accept them because of this, he can nonetheless attend the Christian church and sing there. There is no difference between this process and that process; the point is whatever process one follows, he must become God conscious. God is neither Muslim nor Hindu nor Christian \u2013 He is God. Nor are we to be considered Hindu, Muslim, or Christian. These are bodily designations. We are all pure spirit, part and parcel of the Supreme. God ispavitram,pure, and we are also pure. Somehow or other, however, we have fallen into this material ocean, and as the waves toss, we suffer. Actually we have nothing to do with the tossing waves of material miseries. We must simply pray, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, please pick me up.\u201d As soon as we forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the ocean of illusion is there, and it at once captures us. The chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is most important in order to escape from this ocean. Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is a sound (\u015babda) that is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sound K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the same. When we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and dance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also dancing with us. Of course, we may say, \u201cWell, I do not see Him.\u201d But why do we put so much stress on seeing? Why not hearing? Seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, and hearing are all instruments for experience and knowledge. Why do we put such exclusive stress on seeing? A devotee does not wish to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he is satisfied simply hearing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Seeing may eventually be there, but hearing should not be considered any less important. There are things we hear but do not see \u2013 the wind may be whistling past our ears, and we can hear it, but there is no possibility of seeing the wind. Since hearing is no less valid or less important an experience than seeing, we can hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and realize His presence through sound. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself says, \u201cI am not there in My abode or in the heart of the meditating yogi; I am where My pure devotees are singing My name.\u201d We can actually feel the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as we make progress.",
            "It is not that we should simply take things from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and offer Him nothing. Everyone is taking something from God, so why not give something? We are taking from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so much light, air, food, water, and so on. Unless these resources are supplied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, no one can live. Is it love to simply keep taking and taking and taking without ever offering anything in return? Love means taking and giving also. If we just take from someone and give him nothing in return, that is not love \u2013 it is exploitation. It is not that we should just continue eating without ever offering anything to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says:",
            "patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41yo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchatitad aha\u1e41 bhakty-upah\u1e5btama\u015bn\u0101mi prayat\u0101tmana\u1e25",

            "\u201cIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, I will accept it. O son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01019.26\u201327)",
            "In addition to giving and receiving, in the execution of devotional service one has to submit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a whatever distress or confidential problem he has. He should say, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I am suffering in this way. I have fallen into this tossing ocean of material illusion. Kindly pick me up. I understand now that I am simply put here, as if thrown into the Atlantic Ocean. I may not in any way identify with the Atlantic Ocean, but I am subject to the tossing of the ocean. Actually, I am a spiritual spark, a fragmental part of You.\u201d To our misfortune, we try to identify with this ocean and stop its tossing. We must not try to stop the tossing. It is not possible. In any case, the tossing will go on, for that is the law of nature. Only the foolish try to adjust to this world; the real problem is how to get out of it. Those who do attempt to adjust and who never turn to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are continually subject to transmigration in the ocean of birth and death.",

            "\u201cThose who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01019.3)",
            "By definition, religion is that which connects us with God. If it is not capable of connecting us with God, it is not religion. Religion means searching for God, understanding God, and establishing a relationship with God. This is religion. Those who are engaged in devotional service are acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, and since in this way there is connection with God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a religion.",
            "It is not possible to manufacture a religion. A true religion must come from an authorized source, and that source is either God or His representative. Religion has been called the law of God. It is not possible for a person to manufacture a state law. The law is there, and it is given by the state. One may create some bylaws for his own society, but these laws must be sanctioned by the law of the state. Similarly, if we wish to make some principle of religion, it must be sanctioned by the Vedic authority.",
            "TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is also religion. Great authorities like R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Sv\u0101m\u012b, Lord Caitanya, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, and so many others have accepted theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as the supreme principle of religion and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no doubt about it. In the West also theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is accepted as a great book of philosophy, and many great scholars and philosophers in the West have read and commented on it. Despite acceptance by the scholars and\u0101c\u0101ryas,there are persons who do not accept theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and who have no faith. They do not accept it at all as authority, for they think that it is some sentimental exaggeration by a man known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in the above quoted verse that those who reject theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as authority cannot have any connection with Him, and because they have no relation to Him they remain in the cycle of birth and death.Apr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani. Being subjected tosa\u1e41s\u0101ra,the cycle of birth and death, does not guarantee that one will necessarily get a similar facility for understanding theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the next life. One may not necessarily be born again as a human being, or in America, or in India, or even on this planet. There is no certainty; it all depends on our work. On the path of birth and death we take our birth, remain for some time, enjoy or suffer, then again give up this body and enter into the womb of a mother, either human or animal, then prepare another body to come out and begin our work again. This is calledm\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani. If one wants to avoid this path, he must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "When Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was asked, \u201cWhat is the most wonderful thing in the world?\u201d he replied, \u201cThe most wonderful thing is that every day, every moment, people are dying, and yet everyone thinks death will not come for him.\u201d Every minute and every second we experience that living entities are going to the temple of death. Men, insects, animals, birds \u2013 everyone is going. This world, therefore, is calledm\u1e5btyuloka,the planet of death. Every day there are obituaries, and if we bother to go to the cemetery or crematorium grounds we can validate them. Yet everyone is thinking, \u201cSomehow or other I\u2019ll live.\u201d Everyone is subject to the law of death, yet no one takes it seriously. This is illusion. Thinking we will live forever, we go on doing whatever we like, feeling that we will never be held responsible. This is a very risky life, and it is the densest part of illusion. We should become very serious and understand that death is waiting. We have heard the expression \u201cas sure as death.\u201d This means that in this world death is the most certain thing; no one can avoid it. When death comes, no longer will our puffed-up philosophy or advanced degrees help us. At that time our stout and strong body and our intelligence \u2013 which don\u2019t care for anything \u2013 are vanquished. At that time the fragmental portion (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) comes under the dictation of material nature, andprak\u1e5bti(nature) gives us the type of body for which we are fit. If we want to take this risk, we can avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; if we don\u2019t want to take it, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will come to help us."

            "It may be noted at this point that the ninth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is especially meant for those who have already accepted \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, it is meant for His devotees. If one does not accept \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, this ninth chapter will appear as something different from what it actually is. As stated in the beginning, the subject matter of the ninth chapter is the most confidential material in the entireBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If one doesn\u2019t accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, he will think the chapter to be a mere exaggeration. This is especially the case with the verses dealing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s relationship with His creation.",

Although a manufacturer may refer to his products as being \u201cmanufactured by me,\u201d it does not mean that he personally created or constructed his product, but that the product was produced by his energy. Similarly, if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cWhatever you see in the world was created by Me,\u201d we are not to suppose that He is no longer existing.",
            "It is not very difficult to see God everywhere in the creation, for He is everywhere present. Just as in the Ford factory the workers see Mr. Ford in every corner, those who are conversant with the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can see Him in every atom of the creation. Everything is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (mat-sth\u0101ni sarva bh\u016bt\u0101ni), but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not there (na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His energy are nondifferent, yet the energy is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sun and the sunshine are not different, but the sunshine is not the sun. The sunshine may come through our window and enter our room, but this is not to say that the sun is in our room.

            "There are two kinds of energy \u2013 material and spiritual.J\u012bvas,or individual souls, belong to the superior energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but because they are prone to be attracted to the material energy, they are called the marginal energy. But actually there are only two energies. All of the planetary systems and universes are resting on the energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as all the planets in the solar system are resting in the sunshine, everything within the creation is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-shine. All of these potencies of the Lord give pleasure to a devotee, but one who is envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rejects them. When one is a nondevotee, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements seem to be so much bluff, but when one is a devotee, he thinks, \u201cOh, my Lord is so powerful,\u201d and he becomes filled with love and adoration. Nondevotees think that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am God,\u201d they and everyone else can say the same. But if asked to show their universal form, they cannot do it. That is the difference between a pseudo god and the real God. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes cannot be imitated. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a married over 16,000 wives and kept them nicely in 16,000 palaces, but an ordinary man cannot keep even one wife nicely. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just spoke so many wonderful things; He also acted wonderfully. We should not believe one thing that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says or does and reject another; if belief is there, it must be full belief.",

            "N\u0101rada then left and went on to the cobbler, who asked him, \u201cOh, you have seen the Lord? Tell me, what was He doing?\u201d",
            "\u201cHe was threading an elephant through the eye of a needle,\u201d N\u0101rada replied.",

            "\u201cDo you really believe that the Lord can push an elephant through the hole of a needle?\u201d N\u0101rada asked.",

            "\u201cYou can see that I am sitting under this banyan tree,\u201d the cobbler answered, \u201cand you can see that so many fruits are falling daily, and in each seed there is a banyan tree like this one. If within a small seed there can be a big tree like this, is it difficult to accept that the Lord is pushing an elephant through the eye of a needle?\u201d",
            "So this is called faith. It is not a question of blindly believing. There is reason behind the belief. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can put a large tree within so many little seeds, is it so astounding that He is keeping all the planetary systems floating in space through His energy?",
            "Although scientists may think that the planets are being held in space simply by nature alone, behind nature there is the Supreme Lord. Nature is acting under His guidance. As \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states:",

            "Although all beings in the universe are resting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, still they are not in Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is maintaining all living entities, and His energy is all-pervading, yet He is elsewhere. This is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inconceivable mystic power. He is everywhere, yet He is aloof from everything. We can perceive His energy, but we cannot see Him because He cannot be seen with material eyes. However, when we develop our spiritual qualities, we sanctify our senses so that even within this energy we can see Him. Electricity, for instance, is everywhere, and an electrician is capable of utilizing it. Similarly, the energy of the Supreme Lord is everywhere, and when we become transcendentally situated, we can see God eye to eye everywhere. Spiritualization of the senses is possible through devotional service and love of God. The Lord is all-pervading throughout the universe and is within the soul, the heart, water, air \u2013 everywhere. Thus if we make an image of God in anything \u2013 clay, stone, wood, or whatever \u2013 it should not be considered to be just a doll. That image is also God. If we have sufficient devotion, the image will speak to us. God is everywhere impersonally (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarvam), but if we make His personal form from anything, or if we create an image of God within ourselves, He will be present personally for us. In the\u015b\u0101strasthere are eight kinds of images recommended, and any kind of image can be worshiped because God is everywhere. One may protest and ask, \u201cWhy should God be worshiped in images and not in His original spiritual form?\u201d The answer is that we cannot see God immediately in His spiritual form. With our material eyes we can only see stone, earth, wood \u2013 something tangible. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes as thearc\u0101-vigraha,a form conveniently presented by the Supreme Lord in order for us to see Him. The result is that if we concentrate on the image and make offerings with love and devotion, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will respond through the image.",
            "There are many instances of this happening. In India there is one temple called S\u0101k\u1e63i-Gop\u0101la (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is often called Gop\u0101la). The Gop\u0101lam\u016brti,or statue, was at one time located in a temple in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Once, twobr\u0101hma\u1e47as,one old and one young, went to visit V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana on a pilgrimage. It was a long trip, and in those days there were no railways, so travelers underwent many hardships. The old man was much obliged to the youth for helping him on the journey, and on arriving in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana he said to him, \u201cMy dear boy, you have rendered me so much service, and I am much obliged to you. I would like very much to return that service and give you some reward.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d the youth said, \u201cyou are an old man just like my father. It is my duty to serve you. I don\u2019t require any reward.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I\u2019m obliged to you, and I must reward you,\u201d the old man insisted. He then promised to give the young man his young daughter in marriage.",
            "The old man was a very rich man, and the youth, although a learnedbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,was very poor. Considering this, the youth said, \u201cDon\u2019t promise this, for your family will never agree. I am such a poor man, and you are aristocratic, so this marriage will not take place. Don\u2019t promise this way before the Deity.\u201d",
            "The conversation was taking place in the temple before the Deity of Gop\u0101la K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the young man was anxious not to offend the Deity. However, despite the youth\u2019s pleas, the old man insisted on the marriage. After staying in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana for some time, they finally returned home, and the old man informed his eldest son that his young sister was to be married to the poorbr\u0101hma\u1e47ayouth. The eldest son became very angry: \u201cOh, how have you selected that pauper as husband for my sister? This cannot be.\u201d",
            "The old man\u2019s wife also came to him and said, \u201cIf you marry our daughter to that boy, I shall commit suicide.\u201d",
            "The old man was thus perplexed. After some time, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ayouth became very anxious: \u201cHe has promised to marry his daughter to me, and he made that promise before the Deity. Now he is not coming to fulfill it.\u201d He then went to see the old man to remind him of his promise.",
            "\u201cYou promised before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d the youth said, \u201cand you are not fulfilling that promise. How is that?\u201d",
            "The old man was silent. He began praying to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for he was perplexed. He didn\u2019t want to marry his daughter to the youth and cause such great trouble within his family. In the meantime the elder son came out and began to accuse thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ayouth. \u201cYou have plundered my father in the place of pilgrimage. You gave him some intoxicant and took all his money, and now you are saying he has promised to offer you my youngest sister. You rascal!\u201d",
            "In this way there was much noise, and people began to gather. The youth could understand that the old man was still agreeable but that the family was making it difficult for him. People began to gather about because of the noise the elder son was raising, and thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ayouth began to exclaim to them that the old man had made this promise before the Deities, but that he could not fulfill it because the family was objecting. The eldest son, who was an atheist, suddenly interrupted the youth and said, \u201cYou say that the Lord was witnessing. Well, if He comes and bears witness to my father\u2019s promise, you can have my sister in marriage.\u201d",
            "The youth replied, \u201cYes, I shall ask K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to come as a witness.\u201d He was confident that God would come. An agreement was then made before everyone that the girl would be given in marriage if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as a witness to the old man\u2019s promise.",
            "Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ayouth returned to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and began to pray to Gop\u0101la K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cDear Lord, You must come with me.\u201d He was such a staunch devotee that he spoke to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just as one would speak to a friend. He was not thinking that the Gop\u0101la Deity was a mere statue or image, but he considered Him to be God Himself. Suddenly the Deity spoke to him:",
            "\u201cHow do you think that I can go with you? I am a statue. I can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, if a statue can speak, he can also walk,\u201d the boy replied.",
            "\u201cAll right, then,\u201d the Deity said finally. \u201cI shall go with you, but on one condition. In no case shall you look back to see Me. I will follow you, and you will know that I am following by the jingle of My leg bangles.\u201d",
            "The youth agreed, and in this way they left V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to go to the other town. When the trip was nearly over, just as they were about to enter his home village, the youth could no longer hear the sound of the bangles, and he began to fear: \u201cOh, where is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d Unable to contain himself any longer, he looked back. He saw the statue standing still. Because he looked back, Gop\u0101la would go no further. He immediately ran into the town and told the people to come out and see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who had come as a witness. Everyone was astounded that such a large statue had come from such a distance, and they built a temple on the spot in honor of the Deity, and today people are still worshiping S\u0101k\u1e63i-Gop\u0101la, the Lord as a witness.",
            "We should therefore conclude that because God is everywhere, He is also in His statue, in the image made of Him. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everywhere, as even the impersonalists admit, then why isn\u2019t He in His image? Whether an image or statue speaks to us or not is dependent on the degree of our devotion. But if we choose to see the image merely as stone or a piece of wood, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will always remain stone or wood for us. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everywhere, but as we advance in spiritual consciousness we can begin to see Him as He is. If we put a letter into a mailbox, it will go to its destination because the mailbox is authorized. Similarly, if we worship an authorized image of God, our faith will have some effect. If we are prepared to follow the various rules and regulations \u2013 if we become qualified \u2013 it is possible to see God anywhere and everywhere. When a devotee is present, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His omnipresent energies, will manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, but when His devotee is not there, He will not do this. There are many instances of this. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a pillar. There are many other examples. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is there; all that is required is our qualification to see Him.",

            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sets His nature (prak\u1e5bti) into motion, as one may wind up a clock, and when nature unwinds, it is absorbed into the Lord. The spiritual creation, however, is not like this, for it is permanent. In the material creation everything is temporary. Just as our bodies are developing due to the spiritual spark that is within, the whole creation is coming into being, developing, and passing out of being due to the spirit of the Lord which is within it. Just as our spirit is present within the body, the Lord is present within the universe as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Due to the presence of K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the material creation exists, just as due to our presence our bodies are existing.

Brahman means the greatest, but instead of concerning ourselves with the greatest, we are enmeshed in trying to solve the animal problems of eating, sleeping, defending, and mating. These small problems are automatically solved. Even the animals enjoy mating, sleeping, eating, and defending. The arrangements are all provided. These bodily demands are not really problems, but we have made them problems. TheVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraenjoins us not to concern ourselves with these problems, for they are satisfied in any form of life. Our problem is to inquire about the source of these manifestations. The human form is not meant for struggling hard to solve material problems, which even a hog, a stool-eater, can solve. The hog is considered the lowest among animals, yet it has eating facility, mating facility, sleeping facility, and facilities for defense. Even if we don\u2019t strive for these things, we will have them. Man is meant, rather, to find out the source from which all these things are coming. TheVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrastates that Brahman is that from which everything is emanating (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25). Philosophers, scientists, yogis,j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs,and transcendentalists are all trying to find out the ultimate source of everything.

When death comes, this speaking power ceases \u2013 so who is giving the power of speech? Has the speaking power come automatically from stone? As soon as the speaking power is withdrawn by the Supreme Authority, the body is no better than stone. The very power of speech is proof that there is a Supreme Power who is giving us everything. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that whatever he has is not under his control.

He can be recognized through His supernatural power, by the evidence of authorities and of the scriptures. As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is concerned, every Vedic authority has accepted Him as God.

Now great regimes have been created to smash so many people for the satisfaction of the R\u0101k\u1e63asas\u2019 senses, but they do not realize that their senses will never be satisfied in this way. Nonetheless, the R\u0101k\u1e63asas are prepared to sacrifice everything to satisfy their whimsical desires. It is very difficult for them to understand the real situation because they are overly enamored with material civilization. Who, then, can understand? Those who aremah\u0101tm\u0101s,whose hearts have become magnified, understand that \u201ceverything belongs to God, and I also belong to God.\u201d",
            "Suchmah\u0101tm\u0101sare not under the control of material nature (mah\u0101tm\u0101nas tu m\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101rtha daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25). God is great, and themah\u0101tm\u0101\u2019sheart also becomes great by serving the great.Mah\u0101tm\u0101is not a stamp for a political leader. One cannot be stampedmah\u0101tm\u0101by votes. The standard formah\u0101tm\u0101is given in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:Themah\u0101tm\u0101is one who has taken shelter of the superior energy of the Lord. Of course, all energies are His, and He does not make distinctions between the spiritual energy and the material energy, but for the conditioned soul who is situated marginally between the material energy and the spiritual energy, there is a distinction. Themah\u0101tm\u0101ssee this distinction and so take shelter under the spiritual energy (daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim).",
            "By serving the great, themah\u0101tm\u0101salso become great through identifying with the superior energy:aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi,\u201cI am Brahman-spirit.\u201d It is not that they become puffed up and think they are God. Rather, if one becomes Brahman, he must show his activities in Brahman. Spirit is active, and to become Brahman is not to become inactive. Brahman is spirit, and these material bodies are active only because Brahman is within them. If we are active despite our contact with material nature, do we cease to be active when we purify ourselves of the material contamination and establish ourselves in our proper identity as pure Brahman? Realizing \u201cI am Brahman\u201d means engagement in spiritual activity because we are spirit, and our activities are exhibited even though we are contaminated by matter. To become Brahman does not mean to become void but to establish ourselves in the superior nature, which means superior energy and superior activities. To become Brahman means to be completely engaged in rendering devotional service to the Lord. Thus themah\u0101tm\u0101understands that if service is to be rendered, it is to be rendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and no one else. We have so long served our senses; now we should serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "There is no question of stopping service, for we are meant for service. Is there anyone who does not serve? If we ask the President, \u201cWho are you serving?\u201d he will tell us that he is serving the country. No one is devoid of service. Service we cannot stop, but we do have to redirect our service from the illusion to the reality. When this is done, we become amah\u0101tm\u0101.",
            "This process ofk\u012brtana(k\u012brtayanta\u1e25), always chanting the glories of the Lord, is the beginning of becoming amah\u0101tm\u0101. That process is simplified by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who imparted to humankind this chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. There are nine different processes of devotional service, of which\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam,hearing and chanting, are the most important.K\u012brtanamactually means \u201cdescribing.\u201d We can describe with music, words, pictures, etc.\u015arava\u1e47amgoes hand in hand withk\u012brtanam,for unless we hear, we cannot describe. We don\u2019t need any material qualifications in order to attain the Supreme. All we have to do is hear from authoritative sources and repeat accurately what we hear.",
            "Formerly, theVedaswere heard by the student from the spiritual master, and thus theVedasbecame known as\u015bruti,\u201cthat which is heard.\u201d In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,for example, we see that Arjuna is listening to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the battlefield. He is not engaged in the study ofVed\u0101ntaphilosophy. We can hear from the Supreme Authority in any place, even on the battlefield. The knowledge is received, not manufactured. Some people think, \u201cWhy should I listen to Him? I can think for myself. I can manufacture something new.\u201d This is not the Vedic process of descending knowledge. By ascending knowledge, one tries to elevate himself by his own effort, but by descending knowledge one receives the knowledge from a superior source. In the Vedic tradition, knowledge is imparted to the student from the spiritual master, as in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25). Submissive hearing is so powerful that simply by hearing from authoritative sources we can become completely perfect.",
            "In becoming submissive, we become aware of our own imperfections. As long as we are conditioned, we are subject to four kinds of imperfections: we are sure to commit mistakes, to become illusioned, to have imperfect senses, and to cheat. Therefore our attempt to understand the Absolute Truth by our faulty senses and experience is futile. We must hear from a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who is a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made Arjuna His representative because Arjuna was His devotee:bhakto \u2019si me sakh\u0101 ceti(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.3).",
            "No one can become a representative of God without being His devotee. One who thinks \u201cI am God\u201d cannot be a representative. Because we are part and parcel of God, our qualities are the same as His, and therefore if we study these qualities in ourselves, we come to learn something of God. This does not mean that we understand the quantity of God. This self-realization process is one way of understanding God, but in no case can we preach \u201cI am God.\u201d We cannot claim to be God without being able to display the powers of God. As far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is concerned, He proved that He was God by displaying so much power and by revealing His universal form to Arjuna. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed this awesome form in order to discourage people who would claim to be God. We should not be fooled by one who claims to be God; following in the footsteps of Arjuna, we should request to see the universal form before accepting anyone as God. Only a fool would accept another fool as God.",
            "No one can be equal to God, and no one can be above Him. Even Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, the most exalted demigods, are subservient to Him and pay their respectful obeisances. Instead of trying to become God by one meditational process or another, we had better hear about God submissively and try to understand Him and our relationship to Him. The representative of God never claims to be God or an incarnation of God but the servant of God. This is the sign of the bona fide representative.",
            "Whatever we learn of God from authoritative sources can be described, and that will help us make spiritual progress. This description is calledk\u012brtana. If we try to repeat what we hear, we become established in knowledge. By the process of\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam,hearing and chanting, we can become free from material conditioning and attain to the kingdom of God. In this age it is impossible to practice sacrifice, speculation, or yoga. There is no way open to us but the way of hearing submissively from authoritative sources. This is the way themah\u0101tm\u0101sreceived the most confidential knowledge. It is the way Arjuna received it from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and it is the way we must receive it from the disciplic succession stemming from Arjuna."

            "Many ages ago K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a imparted the divine knowledge of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to Vivasv\u0101n, the god of the sun. To the best of our knowledge, the sun is a very hot place, and we do not consider it possible for anyone to live there. It is not even possible to approach the sun very closely with these bodies. However, from the Vedic literatures we can understand that the sun is a planet just like this one, except everything there is composed of fire. Just as this planet is predominately composed of earth, there are other planets which are predominately composed of fire, water, or air.",
            "The living entities on these various planets acquire bodies composed of elements in accordance with the predominating element on the planet; therefore those beings who live on the sun have bodies composed of fire. Of all beings on the sun, the principal personality is a god by the name of Vivasv\u0101n. He is known as the sun god (s\u016brya-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). On all planets there are principal personalities, just as in the United States the chief person is the President. From the history called theMah\u0101bh\u0101ratawe understand that formerly, there was only one king on this planet, by the name of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata. He ruled some 5,000 years ago, and the planet was named after him. Subsequently, the earth has become divided into so many different countries. In this way there is usually one and sometimes many controllers of the various planets in the universe.",
            "From this first verse of the fourth chapter we learn that millions of years ago \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a imparted the knowledge ofkarma-yogato the sun god Vivasv\u0101n. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who imparts the teachings of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to Arjuna, here indicates that these teachings are not at all new but were enunciated many ages ago on a different planet. Vivasv\u0101n, in his turn, repeated these teachings to his son, Manu. In turn, Manu imparted the knowledge to his disciple Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku was a great king and a forefather of Lord R\u0101macandra. The point being made here is that if one wants to learn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and profit by it, there is a process for understanding it, and that process is described here. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101for the first time to Arjuna. It is estimated by Vedic authorities that the Lord imparted these divine instructions to Vivasv\u0101n some 400 million years ago. From theMah\u0101bh\u0101ratawe understand that theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was spoken to Arjuna some 5,000 years ago. Before Arjuna, the teachings were handed down by disciplic succession, but over such a long period of time, the teachings became lost.",

But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost. That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.2\u20133)",
            "In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101a number of yoga systems are delineated \u2013bhakti-yoga,karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, ha\u1e6dha-yoga\u2013 and therefore it is here called yoga. The word yoga means \u201cto link up,\u201d and the idea is that in yoga we link our con-sciousness to God. It is a means for reuniting with God or reestablishing our relationship with Him. In the course of time, this yoga imparted by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was lost. Why is this? Were there no learned sages at the time \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking to Arjuna? No, there were many sages present at the time. By \u201clost\u201d it is meant that the purport of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was lost. Scholars may give their own interpretation of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,analyzing it according to their own whims, but that is not theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.This is the point that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is stressing, and a student of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101should note it. A person may be a very good scholar from the material point of view, but that does not qualify him to comment on theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In order to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,we have to accept the principle of disciplic succession (parampar\u0101). We must enter into the spirit of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and not approach it simply from the viewpoint of erudition.",
            "Of all people, why did \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a select Arjuna as a recipient of this knowledge? Arjuna was not a great scholar at all, nor was he a yogi, a meditator, or a holy man. He was a warrior about to engage in battle. There were many great sages living at the time, and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could have given theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to them. The answer is that despite being an ordinary man, Arjuna had one great qualification,bhakto \u2019si me sakh\u0101 ceti:\u201cYou are My devotee and My friend.\u201d This was Arjuna\u2019s exceptional qualification, a qualification the sages did not have. Arjuna knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he surrendered himself to Him, accepting Him as his spiritual master. Unless one is a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he cannot possibly understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If one wants to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,he cannot take help from other methods. He must understand it as it is prescribed in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101itself: by understanding it as Arjuna understood it. If we wish to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in a different way, or give an individual interpretation of it, that may be an exhibition of our scholarship, but it is not theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",
            "By scholarship we may be able to manufacture some theory ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,just as Mahatma Gandhi did when he interpreted theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in an effort to support his theory of nonviolence. How is it possible to prove nonviolence from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? The very theme of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101involves Arjuna\u2019s reluctance to fight and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inducing him to kill his opponents. In fact, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that the battle had already been decided by the Supreme, and that the people who were assembled on the battlefield were predestined never to return. It was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s program that the warriors were all destined to die, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave Arjuna the opportunity of taking the credit of conquering them. If fighting is proclaimed a necessity in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,how is it possible to prove nonviolence from it? Such interpretations are attempts to distort theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As soon as theG\u012bt\u0101is interpreted according to the motive of an individual, the purpose is lost. It is stated that we cannot attain the conclusion of the Vedic literature by the force of our own logic or argument. There are many things that do not come within the jurisdiction of our sense of logic. As far as scriptures are concerned, we find different scriptures describing the Absolute Truth in different ways. If we analyze all of them, there will be bewilderment. There are also many philosophers, with many different opinions, and they\u2019re always contradicting one another. If the truth cannot be understood by reading various scriptures, by logical argument, or by philosophical theories, then how can it be attained? The fact is that the wisdom of the Absolute Truth is very confidential, but if we follow the authorities, it can be understood.",
            "In India, there are disciplic successions coming from R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, Nimb\u0101rka, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Sv\u0101m\u012b, and other great sages. The Vedic literatures are understood through the superior spiritual masters. Arjuna understood theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if we wish to understand it, we have to understand it from Arjuna, not from any other source. If we have any knowledge of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,we have to see how it tallies with the understanding of Arjuna. If we understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101in the same way that Arjuna did, we should know that our understanding is correct. This should be the criterion for our studying of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If we actually want to receive benefit from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,we have to follow this principle. TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is not an ordinary book of knowledge that we can purchase from the marketplace, read, and merely consult a dictionary to understand. This is not possible. If it were, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would never have told Arjuna that the science was lost.",
            "It is not difficult to understand the necessity of going through the disciplic succession to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If we wish to be a lawyer, an engineer, or a doctor, we have to receive knowledge from the authoritative lawyers, engineers, and doctors. A new lawyer has to become an apprentice of an experienced lawyer, or a young man studying to be a doctor has to become an intern and work with those who are already licensed practitioners. Our knowledge of a subject cannot be perfected unless we receive it through authoritative sources.",
            "There are two processes for attaining knowledge \u2013 one is inductive and the other is deductive. The deductive method is considered to be more perfect. We may take a premise such as \u201cAll men are mortal,\u201d and no one need discuss how man is mortal. It is generally accepted that this is the case. The deductive conclusion is \u201cMr. Johnson is a man; therefore, Mr. Johnson is mortal.\u201d But how is the premise that all men are mortal arrived at? Followers of the inductive method wish to arrive at this premise through experiment and observations. We may thus study that this man died and that man died, etc., and after seeing that so many men have died we may conclude or generalize that all men are mortal, but there is a major defect in this inductive method, and that is that our experience is limited. We may never have seen a man who is not mortal, but we are judging this on our personal experience, which is finite. Our senses have limited power, and there are so many defects in our conditioned state. The inductive process, consequently, is not always perfect, whereas the deductive process from a source of perfect knowledge is perfect. The Vedic process is such a process.",
            "Although the authority is acknowledged, there are many passages in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that appear to be dogmatic. For instance, in the seventh chapter \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says:",
            "matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyatki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1-jayamayi sarvam ida\u1e41 prota\u1e41s\u016btre ma\u1e47i-ga\u1e47\u0101 iva",
            "\u201cO conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything rests on Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.\u201d (Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01017.7)",
            "\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is saying that there is no authority greater than Him, and this appears to be very dogmatic. If I say, \u201cThere is no one greater than me,\u201d people would think, \u201cOh, Sw\u0101m\u012bj\u012b is very proud.\u201d If a man who is conditioned by so many imperfections says that he is the greatest of all, he blasphemes. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can say this, for we can understand from the histories that even while He was on this earth, He was considered the greatest personality of His time. Indeed, He was the greatest in all fields of activity.",
            "According to the Vedic system, knowledge achieved from the greatest authority is to be considered perfect. According to theVedas,there are three kinds of proof:pratyak\u1e63a, anum\u0101na,and\u015babda. One is by direct visual perception. If a person is sitting in front of me, I can see him sitting there, and my knowledge of his sitting there is received through my eyes. The second method,anum\u0101na,is by inference: we may hear children playing outside, and by hearing we can conjecture that they are there. And the third method is the method of taking truths from a higher authority. Such a saying as \u201cMan is mortal\u201d is accepted from higher authorities. Everyone accepts this, but no one has experienced that all men are mortal. By tradition, we have to accept this. If someone asks, \u201cWho found this truth first? Did you discover it?\u201d it is very difficult to say. All we can say is that the knowledge is coming down and we accept it. Out of the three methods of acquiring knowledge, theVedassay that the third method, that of receiving knowledge from higher authorities, is the most perfect. Direct perception is always imperfect, especially in the conditioned stage of life. By direct perception we can see that the sun is just like a disc no larger than the plate we eat on. From scientists, however, we come to understand that the sun is many thousands of times larger than the earth. So what are we to accept? Are we to accept the scientific proclamation, the proclamation of authorities, or our own experience? Although we cannot ourselves prove how large the sun is, we accept the verdict of astronomers. In this way we are accepting the statements of authorities in every field of our activities. From newspapers and radio we also understand that such and such events are taking place in China and India and other places all around the earth. We\u2019re not experiencing these events directly, and we don\u2019t know that such events are actually taking place, but we accept the authority of the newspapers and radio. We have no choice but to believe authorities in order to get knowledge. And when the authority is perfect, our knowledge is perfect.",
            "According to the Vedic sources, of all authorities K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the greatest and most perfect (matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101n-yat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1-jaya). Not only does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaim Himself to be the highest authority, but this is also accepted by great sages and scholars of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If we do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the authority and take His words as they are, we cannot derive any benefit from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This is not dogmatic; it is a fact. If we scrutinizingly study what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, we will find that it is right. Even scholars like \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who have different opin-ions from the Personality of Godhead, admit that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a issvaya\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n\u2013 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord.",
            "Vedic knowledge is not a recent discovery. It is all old revealed knowledge. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a refers to it aspur\u0101tana\u1e25,which means ancient. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that millions of years before, He spoke this yoga to the sun god, and we do not know how many millions of years before that He spoke it to someone else. This knowledge is always being repeated, just as summer, autumn, winter, and spring are repeated every year. Our fund of knowledge is very poor; we do not even know the history of this planet more than 5,000 years back, but the Vedic literatures give us histories extending to millions of years ago. Just because we have no knowledge of what happened 3,000 years ago on this planet, we cannot conclude that there was no history then. Of course, one can disclaim the historical validity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One may say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, according to theMah\u0101bh\u0101rata,lived 5,000 years ago, and this being the case, there is no possibility of His having spoken theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to the sun god so many millions of years before that. If I said that I gave a speech on the sun to the sun god some millions of years ago, people would say, \u201cSw\u0101m\u012bj\u012b is speaking some nonsense.\u201d But this is not the case with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whether we believe that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to the sun god or not, this fact is being accepted by Arjuna. Arjuna accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Lord, and therefore he knew that it was quite possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to have spoken to someone millions of years before. Although Arjuna personally accepts the statements of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to clarify the situation for people who would come after him, he asks:",

            "\u201cThe sun god Vivasv\u0101n is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.4)",

            "Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, He incarnates many, many times. Arjuna, being a living entity, also takes his birth many, many times. The difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and a living entity ist\u0101ny aha\u1e41 veda sarv\u0101\u1e47i \u2013K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers the events of His past incarnations, whereas the living entity cannot remember. That is one of the differences between God and man. God is eternal, and we are also eternal, but the difference is that we are always changing our bodies. At death we forget the events of our lifetime; death means forgetfulness, that\u2019s all. At night, when we go to sleep, we forget that we are the husband of such and such a wife and the father of such and such children. We forget ourselves in sleep, but when we wake up we remember, \u201cOh, I am so and so, and I must do such and such.\u201d It is a fact that in our previous lives we had other bodies with other families, fathers, mothers, and so on in other countries, but we have forgotten all of these. We might have been dogs or cats or men or gods, but whatever we were we have now forgotten it.",
            "Despite all these changes, as living entities, we are eternal. Just as in previous lives we have prepared for this body, in this lifetime we are preparing for another body. We get our bodies according to ourkarma, or activities. Those who are in the mode of goodness are promoted to higher planets, to a higher status of life(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010114.14). Those who die in the mode of passion remain on earth, and those who die in the mode of ignorance may fall into the animal species of life or be transferred to a lower planet(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010114.15). This is the process that has been going on, but we forget it.",
            "At one time, Indra, the king of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual master, and his spiritual master cursed him to take the birth of a hog. Thus the throne of the heavenly kingdom became empty as Indra went to earth to become a hog. Seeing the situation, Brahm\u0101 came to earth and addressed the hog: \u201cMy dear sir, you have become a hog on this planet earth. I have come to deliver you. Come with me at once.\u201d But the hog replied: \u201cOh, I cannot go with you. I have so many responsibilities \u2013 my children, wife, and this nice hog society.\u201d Even though Brahm\u0101 promised to take him back to heaven, Indra, in the form of a hog, refused. This is called forgetfulness. Similarly, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes and says to us, \u201cWhat are you doing in this material world?Sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. Come to Me, and I\u2019ll give you all protection.\u201d But we say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe You, Sir. I have more important business here.\u201d This is the position of the conditioned soul \u2013 forgetfulness. This forgetfulness is quickly dissipated by following in the path of the disciplic succession."

            "There are two forces of nature working in us. By one we decide that in this lifetime we will make spiritual advancement, but at the next moment the other force,m\u0101y\u0101,or the illusory energy, says, \u201cWhat is all this trouble you\u2019re going through? Just enjoy this life and be easy with yourself.\u201d This tendency to fall into forgetfulness is the difference between God and man. Arjuna is a companion and associate of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, and whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears on any planet, Arjuna also takes birth and appears with Him. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to the sun god, Arjuna was also present with Him. But, being a finite living entity, Arjuna could not remember. Forgetfulness is the nature of the living entity. We cannot even remember what we were doing at this exact time yesterday or a week ago. If we cannot remember this, how is it possible to remember what happened in our previous lives? At this point we may ask how it is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can remember and we cannot, and the answer is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not change His body.",

            "The word\u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends as He is. He does not change His body, but we, as conditioned souls, change ours, and because of this we forget. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows not only the past, present, and future of His activities but the past, present, and future of everyone\u2019s activities.",

            "\u201cO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01017.26)",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe also find that the Supreme Lord is defined as one who knows everything. This is not the case with even the most elevated living entities, such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows everything. We may also ask that if the Lord does not change His body, why does He come as an incarnation? There is much difference among philosophers concerning this question. Some say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a assumes a material body when He comes, but this is not the case. If He assumed a material body like ours, He could not remember, for forgetfulness is due to the material body. The actual conclusion is that He doesn\u2019t change His body. God is called all-powerful, and in the verse quoted above, His omnipotence is explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no birth, and He is eternal. Similarly, the living entity has no birth, and he is also eternal. It is only the body with which the living entity identifies that takes birth.",
            "At the very beginning of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,in the second chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that what we accept as birth and death is due to the body, and as soon as we regain our spiritual body and get out of the contamination of birth and death, we should be qualitatively as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the whole process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 the revival of our originalsac-cid-\u0101nandaspiritual body. That body is eternal (sat), full of knowledge (cit), and blissful (\u0101nanda). This material body is neithersat, cit,nor\u0101nanda. It is perishable, whereas the person who is occupying the body is imperishable. The body is also full of ignorance, and because it is ignorant and temporary, it is full of misery. We feel severe hot or severe cold due to the material body, but as soon as we revive our spiritual body, we become unaffected by dualities. Even while within their material bodies there are yogis who are impervious to dualities such as heat and cold. As we begin to make spiritual advancement while in the material body, we begin to take on the qualities of a spiritual body. If we put iron into a fire, it becomes hot, and then it becomes red-hot, and finally it is no longer iron but fire \u2013 whatever it touches bursts into flames. As we become advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our material body will become spiritualized and will no longer be affected by material contamination.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth \u2013 His appearance \u2013 and disappearance are likened unto the appearance and disappearance of the sun. In the morning it appears as if the sun is born from the eastern horizon, but actually it is not. The sun is neither rising nor setting; it is as it is in its position. All risings and settings are due to the rotation of the earth. Similarly, in Vedic literatures there are prescribed schedules for the appearance and disappearance of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s rising is just like the sun\u2019s. The sun\u2019s rising and setting are going on at every moment; somewhere in the world someone is witnessing sunrise or sunset. It is not that at one point K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is born and at another point He is gone. He is always there somewhere, but He appears to come and go. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears and disappears in many universes. We only have experience of this one universe, but from the Vedic literatures we can understand that this universe is but a part of the infinite manifestations of the Supreme Lord.",
            "Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord and is unborn and unchangeable, He appears in His original transcendental nature. The wordprak\u1e5btimeans \u201cnature.\u201d In the seventh chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is stated that there are many kinds of nature. These have been categorized into three basic types. There is external nature, internal nature, and marginal nature. The external nature is the manifestation of this material world, and in the seventh chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101this is described asapar\u0101,or material nature. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears, He accepts the higher nature (prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 sv\u0101m), not the inferior material nature. Sometimes the head of a state may go to the prison house in order to inspect the prison and see the inmates there, but the prisoners are in error if they think, \u201cThe head of the state has come to the prison, so he is a prisoner just like us.\u201d As pointed out before, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that fools deride Him when He descends in human form (Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,9.11).",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Lord, can come here at any time, and we cannot object and say that He cannot come. He is fully independent, and He can come and disappear as He likes. If the head of a state goes to visit a prison, we are not to assume that he is forced to do so. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes with a purpose, and that is to reclaim fallen conditioned souls. We do not love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loves us. He claims everyone as His son.",

            "\u201cIt should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010114.4)",
            "The father is always affectionate to the son. The son may forget the father, but the father can never forget the son. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes to the material universe out of His love for us \u2013 to deliver us from the miseries of birth and death. He says, \u201cMy dear sons, why are you rotting in this miserable world? Come to Me, and I\u2019ll give you all protection.\u201d We are sons of the Supreme, and we can enjoy life very supremely without any misery and without any doubt. Therefore we should not think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes here just as we do, being obliged by the laws of nature. The Sanskrit wordavat\u0101raliterally means \u201cone who descends.\u201d One who descends from the spiritual universe into the material universe by his own will is called anavat\u0101ra. Sometimes \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends Himself, and sometimes He sends His representative. The major religions of the world \u2013 Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam \u2013 believe in some supreme authority or personality coming down from the kingdom of God. In the Christian religion, Jesus Christ claimed to be the son of God and to be coming from the kingdom of God to reclaim conditioned souls. As followers of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,we admit this claim to be true. So basically there is no difference of opinion. In details there may be differences due to differences in culture, climate, and people, but the basic principle remains the same \u2013 that is, God or His representatives come to reclaim conditioned souls.",

            "God is very compassionate. He wishes to see our miseries cease, but we are trying to adjust to these miseries. Because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, we are not meant for these miseries, but somehow or other we have voluntarily accepted them. There are miseries arising from the body and mind, from other living entities, and from natural catastrophes. We are either suffering from all three of these miseries, or from at least one. We are always trying to make a solution to these miseries, and this attempt constitutes our struggle for existence. That solution cannot be made by our tiny brain. It can be made only when we take to the shelter of the Supreme Lord.",
            "We can become happy when we are reinstated in our constitutional position. TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is meant to reinstate us in that position. God and His representative also come to help. As stated previously, they descend to the material world from the superior nature and are not subject to the laws of birth, old age, disease, and death. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives Arjuna the following reasons for His descent to the world:",
            "paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101mdharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pan\u0101rth\u0101yasambhav\u0101mi yuge yuge",
            "\u201cTo deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.8)",
            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He comes when there is a decline indharma. The Sanskrit worddharmahas been translated into English as \u201cfaith,\u201d but faith has come to mean a religious system that goes under the name of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. But the worddharmadoes not have the same meaning as faith. The faith of an individual may change from Hindu to Buddhist to Christian to Muslim, etc. People have the ability to accept one faith and reject another, butdharmacannot be changed. It is the nature of every individual to render service, either to himself, his family, his community, his nation, or to humanity at large. This rendering of service cannot in any way be divorced from the living entity, and it is this that constitutes thedharmaof every living being. Without rendering service, one cannot exist. The world goes on because we are all rendering and exchanging service. We must forget whether we are Christian, Muslim, or Hindu, and we must understand that we are living entities whose constitutional position is to render service to the supreme living entity. When we reach that stage of understanding, we are liberated.",
            "Liberation is freedom from the temporary designations we have acquired from association with material nature. Liberation is nothing more than this. Because we have material bodies, we take on so many designations; thus we call ourselves a man, a parent, an American, a Christian, a Hindu, etc. These designations should be abandoned if we at all want to become free. Under no circumstances are we masters. We are at present serving, but we are serving with designations. We\u2019re the servants of a wife, of a family, of a job, of our own senses, of our children, and if we have no children we become servants of our cats or dogs. In any case, we must have someone or something to serve. If we have no wife or child, we have to catch some dog or other lower animal in order to serve it. That is our nature. We are compelled to do it. When we at last become free from these designations and begin to render transcendental loving service to the Lord, we attain our perfectional state. We then become established in our truedharma.",
            "Thus \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He appears whenever there is a discrepancy in thedharmaof the living entities \u2013 that is to say, whenever the living entities cease rendering service to the Supreme. In other words, when the living entity is too busily engaged serving his senses, and there is an over-indulgence in sense gratification, the Lord comes. In India, for instance, when people were over-indulging in animal slaughter, Lord Buddha came to establishahi\u1e41s\u0101,nonviolence, toward all living entities. Similarly, in the above-quoted verse, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He comes in order to protect thes\u0101dhus(paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m).S\u0101dhusare typified by their toleration of all other living entities. Despite all inconveniences and dangers, they try to give real knowledge to the people in general. As\u0101dhuis not the friend of a particular society, community, or country but is a friend of all \u2013 not only of human beings but of animals and the lower forms of life. In short, thes\u0101dhuis an enemy of no one and a friend to all. Consequently he is always peaceful. Such persons who have sacrificed everything for the Lord are very, very dear to the Lord. Although thes\u0101dhusdo not mind if they are insulted, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not tolerate any insult to them. As stated in the ninth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is alike to all, but He is especially inclined to His devotees:",
            "samo \u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63una me dve\u1e63yo \u2019sti na priya\u1e25ye bhajanti tu m\u0101\u1e41 bhakty\u0101mayi te te\u1e63u c\u0101py aham",
            "\u201cI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service to Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01019.29)",
            "Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is neutral to all, for one who is constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who is spreading the message of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,He gives special protection. It is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s promise that His devotee shall never perish:kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01019.31).",
            "Not only does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a come to protect and save His devotees, but He also comes to destroy the wicked (vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to establish Arjuna and the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were the most piousk\u1e63atriyasand devotees, as rulers of the world, and He also wanted to vanquish the atheistic party of Duryodhana. And as mentioned before, a third reason for His coming is to establish real religion (dharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pan\u0101rth\u0101ya). Thus \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s purpose for coming is threefold: He protects His devotees, vanquishes the demonic, and establishes the real religion of the living entity. He comes not only once but many, many times (sambhav\u0101mi yuge yuge) because this material world is such that in the course of time, after an adjustment is made, it will again deteriorate.",
            "The world is so conceived that even if we make a very good arrangement, it will gradually deteriorate. After World War I an armistice was signed, and there was a short period of peace, but World War II soon came, and now that that is over they are making preparations for World War III. This is the function of time (k\u0101la) in the material world. We build up a very nice house, and after fifty years it deteriorates, and after one hundred years it deteriorates even more. Similarly, when the body is young, people care for it, always lavishing affection on it and kissing it, but when it grows old no one cares for it. This is the nature of the material world: Even if a very good adjustment is made, it will in course of time be vanquished. Therefore adjustments are periodically required, and from age to age the Supreme Lord or His representative comes to make adjustments in the direction of civilization. Thus \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends many times to establish or rejuvenate many different religions."

            "\u201cO chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than the mere sacrifice of material possessions. After all, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, all sacrifices of work culminate in transcendental knowledge.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.33)",
            "Knowledge is the best sacrifice because this conditioned life is due to ignorance. The purpose of sacrifice, penance, yoga, and philosophical discussion is to acquire knowledge. There are three stages of transcendental knowledge, by which one realizes the impersonal aspect of God (Brahman), the localized aspect of God within the heart and within every atom (Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul), and the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Bhagav\u0101n). But the very first step in acquiring knowledge is coming to understand that \u201cI am not this body but spirit soul, and my aim of life is to get out of this material entanglement.\u201d The point is that whatever sacrifice we make is intended to enable us to come to the point of real knowledge. The highest perfection of knowledge is given in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.19)as surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate). Thej\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n,not the fool, surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the highest stage of knowledge. Similarly, at the end of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises Arjuna:",

            "This is the most confidential part of knowledge. From all points of view, if we make an analytical study of the Vedic literatures, we will find that the ultimate summit of knowledge is to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And what type of surrender is recommended? Surrender in full knowledge \u2013 when we come to the perfectional point we must understand that V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is everything. This is also confirmed in theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:",

            "\u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u01015.1)",
            "The wordssarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47aindicate that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes. If we search to see who the father of our father is, and who his father is, and so on back, if it were somehow possible to trace our ancestry back through time, we would arrive at the supreme father, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
            "Of course, everyone wants to see God immediately, but we can see God when we are qualified and in perfect knowledge. We can see God eye to eye, just as we are seeing one another, but qualification is required, and that qualification is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness begins with\u015brava\u1e47am,hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and other Vedic literatures, andk\u012brtanam,repeating what we\u2019ve heard and glorifying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by chanting His names. By chanting and hearing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we can actually associate with Him, for He is absolute and nondifferent from His names, qualities, forms, and pastimes. As we associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He helps us to understand Him and dispels the darkness of ignorance with the light of knowledge. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sitting within our hearts, acting as guru. When we begin hearing topics about Him, the dust that has accumulated on our minds due to so many years of material contamination becomes gradually cleaned. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a friend to everyone, but He is a special friend to His devotees. As soon as we become a little inclined toward Him, He begins to give favorable instructions from within our heart so that we can gradually make progress. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the first spiritual master, and when we become more interested in Him, we have to go to as\u0101dhu,or a holy man, who serves as the spiritual master from without. This is enjoined by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the following verse:",
            "tad viddhi pra\u1e47ip\u0101tenaparipra\u015bnena sevay\u0101upadek\u1e63yanti te j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101ninas tattva-dar\u015bina\u1e25",
            "\u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.34)",
            "It is necessary to select a person to whom we can surrender ourselves. Of course, no one likes to surrender to anyone. We are puffed up with whatever knowledge we have, and our attitude is, \u201cOh, who can give me knowledge?\u201d Some people say that for spiritual realization there is no need for a spiritual master, but so far as the Vedic literature is concerned, and as far as theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,and theUpani\u1e63adsare concerned, there is need of a spiritual master. Even in the material world, if one wants to learn to be a musician, he has to search out a musician to teach him, or if one wants to be an engineer, he has to go to a technological college and learn from those who know the technology. Nor can anyone become a doctor by simply purchasing a book from the market and reading it at home. One has to be admitted to a medical college and undergo training under licensed doctors. It is not possible to learn any major subject simply by purchasing books and reading them at home. Someone is needed to show us how to apply the knowledge found in the books. As far as the science of God is concerned, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, advises us to go to a person to whom we can surrender. This means that we have to check to see if a person is capable of giving instructions on theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and other literatures of God realization. It is not that we are to search out a spiritual master whimsically. We should be very serious to find a person who is actually in knowledge of the subject.",
            "At the beginning of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101Arjuna was talking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just like a friend, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was questioning how he, as a military man, could give up fighting. But when Arjuna saw that friendly talks would not make a solution to his problems, he surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, saying,\u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam:\u201cNow I am Your disciple and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01012.7)This is the process. It is not that we should blindly surrender, but we should be able to inquire with intelligence.",
            "Without inquiry, we cannot make advancement. In school, a student who makes inquiries from the teacher is usually an intelligent student. It is generally a sign of intelligence when a small child inquires from his father, \u201cOh, what is this? What is that?\u201d We may have a very good spiritual master, but if we have no power to inquire, we cannot make progress. Nor should the inquiry be of the nature of a challenge. One should not think, \u201cNow I will see what kind of spiritual master he is. I will challenge him.\u201d Our inquiries (paripra\u015bnena) should be on the subject of service (sevay\u0101). Without service our inquiries will be futile, but even before making inquiries, we should have some qualification. If we go to a store to purchase some gold or jewelry and we know nothing about gold or jewels, we are likely to be cheated. If we go to a jeweler and say, \u201cCan you give me a diamond?\u201d he will understand that this is a fool. He could charge us any price for anything. That kind of searching will not do at all. We first have to become a little intelligent, for it is not possible to make spiritual progress otherwise.",
            "The beginning injunction of theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btraisath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101:\u201cNow is the time to inquire about Brahman.\u201d The wordathameans that one who is intelligent, who has come to the point of realizing the basic frustrations of material life, is capable of making inquiry. In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated that one should inquire from a spiritual master about subjects that are \u201cbeyond this darkness.\u201d This material world is by nature dark, and it is artificially lighted by fire. Our inquiries should be about the transcendental worlds, which lie beyond this universe. If one is desirous to find out about these spiritual worlds, he should seek out a spiritual master; otherwise, there is no point in searching. If I want to study theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101or theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrain order to make material improvement, it is not necessary to find a spiritual master. One should first want to inquire about Brahman and then search out a master who has perfect vision of the Absolute Truth (j\u00f1\u0101ninas tattva-dar\u015bina\u1e25). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supremetattva,Absolute Truth. In the seventh chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states:",

            "Thus out of many perfected spiritualists, one man may know what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actually is. As this verse indicates, the subject matter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not so easy; it is very difficult. Yet theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101also indicates that it is easy.",
            "bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101tiy\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25tato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101vi\u015bate tad-anantaram",
            "\u201cOne can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010118.55)",
            "If we accept the process of devotional service, we can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily. Through it we can understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a perfectly and become eligible for entering into the spiritual kingdom. If, as theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101says, after many births we have to eventually surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, why not surrender to Him immediately? Why wait for many, many births? If surrender is the end of perfection, why not accept perfection immediately? Of course the answer is that people are generally doubtful. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be attained in one second, or it cannot be had even after a thousand births and deaths. If we choose, we can immediately become great souls by surrendering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but because we have doubts whether or not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually the Supreme, we have to take time to dissipate these doubts through study of the scriptures. By studying theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, we can remove these doubts and make definite progress.",
            "It is the fire of knowledge that burns all doubts and fruitive activities to ashes. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the following information about the results of inquiring about the truth from one who has actually seen the truth.",

            "\u201cHaving obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine. Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries. As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.35\u201337)",
            "The fire of knowledge is ignited by the spiritual master, and when it is ablaze, all the reactions to our works are turned to ashes. The reactions to our work, or ourkarma, are the cause for our bondage. There are good works and bad works, and in this verse the wordsarva-karm\u0101\u1e47iindicates both. For one who wants to be liberated from this material bondage, the reactions of both good works and bad works are detrimental. In this material world we are attached to performing good works if we are situated in the mode of goodness. If we are in the modes of passion and ignorance, however, we do bad work in passion and ignorance. But for those who are going to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, there is no need of good work or bad work. By good work we may get a good birth in an aristocratic or wealthy family, and by bad work we may take birth even in the animal kingdom or in degraded human families, but in any case birth means bondage, and one who is striving for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is striving for liberation from the bondage of transmigration. What is the advantage of being born in a wealthy or aristocratic family if one does not get rid of his material miseries? Whether we enjoy the reactions of good work or suffer the reactions of bad, we have to take on the material body and thereby undergo the material miseries.",
            "By engaging in the transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we actually get out of the cycle of birth and death. But because the fire of knowledge is not burning in our minds, we accept material existence as happiness. A dog or hog cannot understand what kind of miserable life he is passing. He actually thinks he is enjoying life, and this is called the covering or illusory influence of material energy. On the Bowery there are so many drunkards lying in the street, and they\u2019re all thinking, \u201cWe are enjoying life.\u201d But those who are passing them by are thinking, \u201cOh, how miserable they are.\u201d That is the way of the illusory energy. We may be in a miserable condition, but we accept it thinking that we are very happy. This is called ignorance. But when one is awakened to knowledge, he thinks, \u201cOh, I am not happy. I want freedom, but there is no freedom. I don\u2019t want to die, but there is death. I don\u2019t want to grow old, but there is old age. I don\u2019t want diseases, but there are diseases.\u201d These are the major problems of human existence, but we ignore them and concentrate on solving very minor problems. We consider economic development to be the most important thing, forgetting how long we shall live here in this material world. Economic development or no economic development, at the end of sixty or a hundred years our life will be finished. Even if we accumulate a million dollars, we must leave it all behind when we leave this body. We need to come to understand that in the material world whatever we are doing is being defeated by the influence of material nature.",
            "We want freedom, and we want to travel all over the world and all over the universe. Indeed, that is our right as spirit soul. The spirit soul in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is calledsarva-gata\u1e25,which means that he has the ability to go wherever he likes. In the Siddhalokas there are perfected beings, or yogis, who can travel wherever they want without the aid of airplanes or other mechanical contrivances. Once we are liberated from material conditioning we can become very powerful. Actually we have no idea how powerful we are as spiritual sparks. Instead we are very much satisfied staying on this earth and sending up a few spaceships, thinking that we have become greatly advanced in material science. We spend millions and millions of dollars constructing spaceships without knowing that we have the ability to travel wherever we want, free of charge.",
            "The point is that we should cultivate our spiritual potencies by knowledge. The knowledge is already there; we simply have to accept it. In former ages people underwent so many penances and austerities to acquire knowledge, but in this age this process is not possible because our lives are very short and we are always disturbed. The process for this age is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which was inaugurated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. If, by this process, we can kindle the fire of knowledge, all of the reactions of our activities will be reduced to ashes, and we will be purified.",

In goodness one becomes aware of his position as well as transcendental subjects, etc., but his defect is in thinking, \u201cNow I have understood everything.

The first symptom of one\u2019s having become established on thebrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25platform is that one becomes jolly (prasann\u0101tm\u0101). On that platform, there is neither lamentation nor hankering. But even if we rise to this stage and do not take to the loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is the possibility of falling down again into the material whirlpool. We may rise very high in the sky, but if we have no shelter there, if we do not land on some planet, we will again fall down. A simple understanding of thebrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25stage will not help us unless we take to the shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet.

            "Our nature is such that we want some engagement. A child may commit mischief, but he cannot refrain from mischief unless he is given some engagement. When he is given some toys, his attention is diverted and his mischievous activities stop. We are like mischievous children, and therefore we must have spiritual engagement. Simply understanding that we are spirit soul will not help. After understanding that we are spirit, we have to sustain the spirit by spiritual engagement. It is not uncommon in India for a man to give up all material engagements, to leave his home and family and to take the renounced order,sanny\u0101sa,and then after meditating for a while, to take up philanthropic work by opening hospitals or engaging in politics. The hospital-making business is being conducted by the government; it is the duty of asanny\u0101s\u012bto make hospitals whereby people can actually get rid of their material bodies, not patch them up.

            "For those who are hesitant and have no faith, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very difficult. Even in our daily affairs a certain amount of faith is required. When we buy a ticket, we have faith that the airline company will take us to our destination. Without faith we cannot even live in the material world, what to speak of making spiritual progress. Where are we to keep our faith? In the authority. We should not book our ticket with an unauthorized company. Faith must be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.How do we become faithful? Control of the senses (sa\u1e41yatendriya\u1e25) is required. We are in the material world because we want to gratify our senses. If we have faith that a physician can cure us, and he tells us not to eat such and such, and we eat it anyway, what kind of faith do we have? If we have faith in our physician, we will follow his prescriptions for cure. The point is that we have to follow the instructions with faith. Then wisdom will come.

Having attained that stage of faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one feels that he is the happiest man in the world. This is our position. We have to accept the formula and execute it with faith. This faith must be in the supreme authority, not in a third-class man. We must search out a spiritual master in whom we can have faith. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most authorized personality, but anyone who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious can be accepted because a person fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Having tasted the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s representative, we will feel satisfied, just as we feel satisfied upon eating a full meal.",

The material world is already miserable, but if one has no faith, it will be more miserable. Thus for the faithless the situation is very precarious.

            "As stated before, we must search out one who has seen the Absolute Truth and surrender to him and serve him. When this is done, there is no doubt about one\u2019s spiritual salvation. Everyone is anxious to see God, but in our present stage of life we are conditioned and deluded. We have no idea of things as they really are. Although we are Brahman and by nature jolly, we have somehow fallen from our constitutional position. Our nature issac-cid-\u0101nanda\u2013 eternal, blissful, and full of knowledge \u2013 yet this body is destined to die, and while it exists it is full of ignorance and miseries. The senses are imperfect, and it is not possible to attain perfect knowledge through them. Therefore it is stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that if we at all want to learn transcendental knowledge, we must approach one who has actually seen the Absolute Truth (tad-viddhi pra\u1e47ip\u0101tena). Traditionally,br\u0101hma\u1e47asare meant to be spiritual masters, but in this Age of Kali it is very difficult to find a qualifiedbr\u0101hma\u1e47a.Consequently, it is very difficult to find a qualified spiritual master. Therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has recommended,kib\u0101 vipra, kib\u0101 ny\u0101s\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra kene naya/ yei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei \u2018guru\u2019 haya:\u201cWhether one be abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor a\u015b\u016bdraor asanny\u0101s\u012bor a householder, it doesn\u2019t matter. If he knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\u2019s a bona fide spiritual master.\u201d",
            "TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if we study it scrutinizingly with all of our argument, sense, and philosophical knowledge, we will come to know that science. It is not that we are to submit ourselves blindly. The spiritual master may be self-realized and situated in the Absolute Truth, yet we have to question him in order to understand all spiritual points. If one is able to factually answer the questions about the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is the spiritual master, regardless of where he is born or what he is \u2013 whether he be abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor\u015b\u016bdraor American or Indian or whatever. When we go to a doctor, we do not ask him whether he is a Hindu, Christian, orbr\u0101hma\u1e47a.He has the qualification of a medical man, and we simply surrender, saying, \u201cDoctor, treat me. I am suffering.\u201d",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of spiritual science. Of course, when we speak of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we refer to God. There are many names for God throughout the world and throughout the universe, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme name according to Vedic knowledge. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommended the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare as the supreme means for realization in this age. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu did not make any distinctions as to caste or social position. Indeed, most of His foremost disciples were considered to be fallen in society. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu even appointed Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a Muslim, asn\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya,or preceptor of the holy names. Similarly, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, two of Lord Caitanya\u2019s principal disciples, were formerly known as S\u0101kara Mallika and Dabira Kh\u0101sa and were employed by the Muslim government. In those days, the Hindus were so strict that if abr\u0101hma\u1e47aaccepted service from a non-Hindu, he was immediately ostracized from Hindu society. Despite this, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b were made principal authorities in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. So there is no bar against anyone; anyone can become a spiritual master provided he knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the only qualification, and this science in essence is contained in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.At the present moment, thousands of spiritual masters are needed to spread this great science throughout the world.",
            "We should understand that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking to Arjuna in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,He is speaking not simply to Arjuna alone but to the whole human race. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself declares that simply by knowing the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna would not be subject to illusion (yaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 na punar moham). If we have a very good ship, we can easily cross the Atlantic Ocean. At present we are in the midst of the ocean of ignorance, for this material world has been likened to a great ocean of nescience. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way:",

Please pick me up from this ocean of death and fix me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka5)",
            "If we have the boat of perfect knowledge, there is no fear, for we can cross the ocean very easily. Even if a person is most sinful, if he receives the boat of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can cross the ocean very easily. As stated before(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.36), it does not matter what we were in our past lives. Because we were in ignorance, we may have committed so many abominable actions. Indeed, no one can say that he is free from sinful activity. But according to theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101this does not matter. Just by knowing the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one becomes free.",
            "It is therefore absolutely necessary that we seek knowledge, and the perfection of knowledge is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Today there are so many theories, and everyone claims to know the best way to live; therefore so many ism\u2019s have evolved. Of these, communism has become very prominent in the world. But in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwe find the seed for spiritual communism. There N\u0101rada Muni explains that in this material universe \u2013 whether one be in a lower, middle, or higher planetary system, or even in outer space \u2013 all natural resources are manifested by the Supreme Lord. We must understand that whatever exists in this world was not produced by any human being, but everything was created by God.

            "Consequently, all living entities, beginning from Brahm\u0101, the highest demigod, down to the lowest ant, have the right to use natural resources. N\u0101rada Muni points out that we can use these resources as much as we require, but if we take more than required, we become thieves. Unfortunately, everyone is trying to conquer and predominate. Countries race to the moon in order to put up their flags and claim that planet. When Europeans came to America, they put up their flag and claimed it for their nation. This flag-planting and flag-waving are all due to ignorance. We do not stop to think where we are putting our flag. It is not our property but God\u2019s. Knowing this fact is knowledge, and thinking that it is my property is ignorance. We have the right to utilize but not to claim or hoard.",
            "If we throw a bag of grain into the street, pigeons may come and eat four or five small grains and then go away. They will not take more than they can eat, and having eaten, they go freely on their way. But if we were to put many bags of flour on the sidewalk and invite people to come and get them, one man would take ten or twenty bags and another would take fifteen or thirty bags and so on. But those who do not have the means to carry so much away will not be able to take more than a bag or two. Thus the distribution will be uneven. This is called advancement of civilization; we are even lacking in the knowledge the pigeons, dogs, and cats have. Everything belongs to the Supreme Lord, and we can accept whatever we need, but not more. That is knowledge. By the Lord\u2019s arrangement the world is so made that there is no scarcity of anything. Everything is sufficient, provided that we know how to distribute it. However, the deplorable condition today is that one is taking more than he needs while another is starving. Consequently the starving masses are revolting and asking, \u201cWhy should we starve?\u201d But their methods are imperfect. The perfection of spiritual communism is found in the knowledge that everything belongs to God. By knowing the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we can easily cross over the ignorance of false proprietorship.",
            "We are actually suffering due to our ignorance. In the law court ignorance is no excuse. If we tell the judge that we are not aware of the law, we will be punished anyway. If one has illegally amassed so much wealth and yet claims ignorance of his transgression, he will be punished nonetheless. The whole world is lacking this knowledge, and therefore thousands of teachers of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are needed. There is a great necessity for this knowledge now. We should not think that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was born in India that knowledge of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is sectarian or that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a sectarian God. Indeed, in the fourteenth chapter \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims Himself to be the father of all beings, as pointed out previously(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010114.4).",
            "As spirit souls we are part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit, but due to our desire to enjoy this material world, we have been put into material nature. Yet in whatever species of life we may be, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Father. Thus theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is not meant for any particular party or nation but for everyone all over the world \u2013 even for the animals. Now that the sons of the Supreme are committing theft due to ignorance, it is the duty of one who is conversant with theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to spread this supreme knowledge to all beings. In this way people may realize their true spiritual nature and their relationship to the supreme spiritual whole."

In theBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101it is stated that beginning with the microbe, which is calledindragopa,up to Indra, the king of the heavenly planets, all are bound bykarma,the reactions to work. We all have to suffer or enjoy the reactions of our work, be they good or bad. As long as we have to suffer or enjoy these reactions, we are bound to these material bodies.",
            "By nature\u2019s arrangement the material body is given to the living entity for his suffering or enjoyment. Different types of bodies are acquired for different purposes. The body of a tiger is made for killing and eating raw meat. Similarly, the hogs are made in such a way that they can eat stool. And as human beings, our teeth are made for eating vegetables and fruits. All of these bodies are made according to the work done by the living entity in past lives. Our next bodies are being prepared according to the work we are now doing, but in the previously quoted verse, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that those who know the transcendental nature of His activities become free from the reactions of their own activities. Our activities should be such that we will not again become entangled in this material world. This can be made possible if we become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by studying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, learning of the transcendental nature of His activities, and understanding how He behaves in this material world and in the spiritual world.",
            "When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes to this earth, He is not like us; He is totally transcendental. We desire the fruits of our activities, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not desire any fruits, nor are there any reactions to His actions. Nor does He have any desire for fruitive activity (na me karma-phale sp\u1e5bh\u0101). When we enter into business, we hope for profit, and with that profit we hope to buy things that will make our life enjoyable. Whenever conditioned souls do something, there is a desire for enjoyment behind it. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has nothing to desire. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is full with everything. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came to this earth He had many girlfriends and over 16,000 wives, and some people think that He was very sensual, but this was not the fact.",
            "We must understand the meaning of relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this material world we have many relationships as father, mother, wife, or husband. Whatever relationship we find here is but a perverted reflection of the relationship we have with the Supreme Lord. Whatever we find in this material world is born of the Absolute Truth, but here it is pervertedly reflected in time. Whatever relationship we have with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a goes on. If we have a relationship in friendship, that friendship is eternal and continues from life to life. In the material world, a friendship exists for a few years and then breaks; therefore it is called perverted, temporary, or unreal. If we make our friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it will never break. If we make K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a our master, we will never be cheated. If we love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as our son, He will never die. If we love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as our lover, He will be the best of all, and there will be no separation. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, He is unlimited and has an unlimited number of devotees. Some are trying to love Him as a lover or husband, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts this role. In whatever way we approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He will accept us, as He states in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.11)",

Similarly, in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that those boys who were playing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had undergone great penances and austerities in their previous lives in order to acquire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a playmate. Thus the playmates, associates, and wives of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are not ordinary living entities. Because we have no idea of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we take His activities as triflings, but actually they are sublime. All perfection of our desires is there; whatever desires we have constitutionally will be perfectly fulfilled when we are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not need any friends to play with Him, nor did He desire a single wife. We take on a wife because we have some desire to fulfill, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete in Himself (p\u016br\u1e47am). A poor man may desire to have a thousand dollars in the bank, but a rich man who has millions has no such desire. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why should He have desires? Rather, He fulfills the desires of others. Man proposes and God disposes. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had any desire, He would be imperfect, for He would be lacking something. Therefore He says that He has no desire to fulfill. As Yoge\u015bvara, or the master of all yogis, whatever He wills is immediately realized. There is no question of desire. He becomes a husband or lover or friend just to fulfill the desires of His devotees. If we accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as friend, master, son, or lover, we will never be frustrated. Every living entity has a specific relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but at present this relationship is covered. As we advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it will be revealed.",
            "Although the Supreme Lord is full and has nothing to do, He works in order to set an example. He is not bound to His activities in the material world, and one who knows this also becomes free from activities that bring karmic reaction.",

Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu came with this mission of teaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and He said that regardless of one\u2019s position, if he teaches K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he is to be considered a spiritual master. Both theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamare filled with information on how to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.

But we should be careful to present theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is, without personal interpretation or motivation. Some people present interpretations of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,but we should present the words as they are spoken by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One who works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may appear to be working like anyone else in the material world, but this is not the case. Arjuna may have fought just like an ordinary military man, but because he fought in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he was free from the entanglement of his activities. In this way, his work, although appearing material, was not material at all. Any action sanctioned by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 regardless of what it may be \u2013 has no reaction. Fighting may not be a very nice thing, but sometimes, as in the case of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, it is an absolute necessity. On the other hand, we may perform work that may be very altruistic or humanitarian in the opinion of the world and yet be bound to material activity. So it is not the action itself that is important but the consciousness in which the action is carried out.Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.17) says:",

If we simply engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, everything becomes clear. Otherwise we will have to make distinctions between what we should do and what we should not do in order not to become entangled. In the ordinary course of life we unknowingly break some law and have to suffer the consequences. Similarly, the laws of nature are very strict and stringent, and they accept no excuse. It is a law of nature that fire burns, and even if a child touches it, he will be burned despite his ignorance and innocence. Thus we have to choose our course of action very carefully lest the stringent laws of nature react to bind us to suffering. It is therefore necessary to understand what work to do and what work to avoid.",
            "The wordkarmarefers to prescribed duties; the wordvikarmarefers to activities against prescribed duties; and the wordakarmarefers to activities with no reaction at all. In the execution of akarmic activities there may appear to be some reactions, but in actuality there are not. When we work under the directions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, this is actually the case \u2013 there are no reactions. If we take it upon ourselves to kill someone, we are subject to capital punishment by the state government. Our actions are then calledvikarma,for they are against prescribed actions. If, however, the government drafts us into the army, and we engage in battle and kill someone, we do not suffer the reactions, and this is calledakarma.In the one case we are acting according to our own whims, and in the other we are acting under the direction of the government. Similarly, when we act under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s direction, the actions we perform are calledakarma,for that kind of activity has no reaction.",

            "One who can actually see that despite activities there are no karmic reactions, who understands the nature ofakarma,actually sees things as they are. The wordakarma\u1e47irefers to one who is trying to avoid the reactions ofkarma. By dovetailing one\u2019s activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although one may perform all kinds of activities, he is free. On the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Arjuna engaged in fighting, and those on the side of Duryodhana also engaged in fighting. We must understand how it is that Arjuna is free from reaction whereas Duryodhana is not. Externally we can see that both parties are engaged in fighting, but we should understand that Arjuna is not bound by reactions because he is fighting under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus when we see someone working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we should understand that his work does not carry any reaction. One who can see such work and understand it is to be considered very intelligent (sa buddhim\u0101n). The technique is not so much in seeing what a person is doing but in understanding why he is doing it.",
            "Actually Arjuna was engaged in very unpleasant activity on the battlefield, but because he was in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he suffered no reaction. We may be performing some action which we may consider to be very good work, but if we do not perform it in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we have to suffer the reactions. From the material point of view Arjuna\u2019s initial decision not to fight was a good one, but from the spiritual point of view it was not. When we do pious work, we get certain results. We may take a birth in a very good family \u2013 in the family of abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor a wealthy man \u2013 we may become very rich or very learned, or we may become very beautiful. On the other hand, if we do impious work, we may have to take birth in a low-class or animal family, or become illiterate or foolish, or very ugly. Although we engage in very pious work and take a good birth, we will still be subject to the stringent laws of action and reaction. Our principal aim should be to escape the laws of this material world. If we don\u2019t understand this, we will become attracted by aristocratic families, wealth, a good education, or a beautiful body. We should come to understand that despite having all these facilities for material life, we are not free from birth, old age, disease, and death. To caution us about this, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a warns in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.16):",

We have to go to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet in order to be free from this. It may be very nice to be a rich or beautiful person, but how long shall we remain such? That is not our permanent life. We may remain learned, rich, and beautiful for fifty, sixty, or at most a hundred years, but real life is not for fifty or a hundred years, nor a thousand years, nor even a million years. We are eternal, and we have to attain our eternal life. That we have not attained it is our whole problem. That problem can be solved when we are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
            "If we leave this material body in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we will no longer have to return to the material world. The point is to avoid this material existence altogether. It is not a question of improving our condition in the material world. In prison a man may want to improve his condition to become a first-class prisoner, and the government may give him A status, but no sane man will become satisfied by becoming an A-class prisoner. He should desire to get out of the prison altogether. In the material world some of us are A-class, B-class, or C-class prisoners, but in any case we are all prisoners.
