            "Throughway to Happiness",
            "Every one of us is searching after happiness, but we do not know what real happiness is. We see so much advertised about happiness, but practically speaking we see so few happy people. This is because so few people know that the platform of real happiness is beyond temporary things. It is this real happiness that is described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna.",
            "Happiness is generally perceived through our senses. A stone, for instance, has no senses and cannot perceive happiness and distress. Developed consciousness can perceive happiness and distress more intensely than undeveloped consciousness. Trees have consciousness, but it is not developed. Trees may stand for a long time in all kinds of weather, but they have no way of perceiving miseries. If a human being were asked to stand like a tree for only three days or even less, he would not be able to tolerate it. The conclusion is that every living being feels happiness or distress according to the degree of development of his consciousness.",
            "The happiness that we are experiencing in the material world is not real happiness. If one asks a tree, \u201cAre you feeling happy?\u201d the tree, if it could, might say, \u201cYes, I am happy, standing here all year. I\u2019m enjoying the wind and snowfall very much,\u201d etc. This may be enjoyed by the tree, but for the human being it is a very low standard of enjoyment. There are different kinds and grades of living entities, and their conceptions and perceptions of happiness are also of all different types and grades. Although one animal may see that another animal is being slaughtered, he will go right on chewing grass, for he has no knowledge to understand that he may be next. He is thinking that he is happy, but at the next moment he may be slaughtered.",
            "In this way there are different degrees of happiness. Yet of all of them, what is the highest happiness? \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna:",
            "sukham \u0101tyantika\u1e41 yat tadbuddhi-gr\u0101hyam at\u012bndriyamvetti yatra na caiv\u0101ya\u1e41sthita\u015b calati tattvata\u1e25",
            "\u201cIn that joyous state (sam\u0101dhi), one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth.\u201d (G\u012bt\u01016.21)",
            "Buddhimeans intelligence; one has to be intelligent if he wants to enjoy. Animals do not have really developed intelligence and so cannot enjoy life as a human being can. The hands, the nose, the eyes, the other sense organs, and all the bodily parts may be present on a dead man, but he cannot enjoy. Why not? The enjoying energy, the spiritual spark, has left, and therefore the body has no power. If one looks further into the matter with a little intelligence, he can understand that it was not the body that was enjoying at all but the small spiritual spark that was within. Although one may think that he is enjoying by the bodily sense organs, the real enjoyer is that spiritual spark. That spark always has the potency of enjoyment, but it is not always manifest due to being covered by the material tabernacle. Although we may not be aware of it, it is not possible for the body to experience enjoyment without the presence of this spiritual spark. If a man is offered the dead body of a beautiful woman, will he accept it? No, because the spiritual spark has moved out of the body. Not only was it enjoying within the body, but it was maintaining the body. When that spark leaves, the body simply deteriorates.",
            "It follows that if the spirit is enjoying, it must have its senses also, otherwise how can it enjoy? TheVedasconfirm that the spirit soul, although atomic in size, is the actual enjoying agent. It is not possible to measure the soul, but that is not to say that it is without measurement. An object may seem to us to be no bigger than a point and may seem to have no length or width, but when we perceive it under a microscope we can see that it has both length and width. Similarly, the soul also has its dimensions, but we cannot perceive them. When we buy a suit or dress, it is made to fit the body. The spiritual spark must have form, otherwise how is it the material body has grown to accommodate it? The conclusion is that the spiritual spark is not impersonal. It is an actual person. God is an actual person, and the spiritual spark, being a fragmental part of Him, is also a person. If the father has personality and individuality, the son also has them; and if the son has them, we can conclude that the father has them. So how can we, as sons of God, assert our personality and individuality and at the same time deny them to our Father, the Supreme Lord?",
            "At\u012bndriyammeans that we have to transcend these material senses before we can appreciate real happiness.Ramante yogino \u2019nante saty\u0101nanda-cid-\u0101tmani:the yogis who are aspiring after spiritual life are also tasting enjoyment by focusing on the Supersoul within. If there is no pleasure, if there is no enjoyment, then what is the point of going to so much trouble to control the senses? What kind of pleasure are the yogis relishing if they are taking so much trouble? That pleasure isananta \u2013endless. How is this? The spirit soul is eternal, and the Supreme Lord is eternal; therefore reciprocation of their loving exchanges is eternal. One who is actually intelligent will refrain from the flickering sensual enjoyment of this material body and fix his enjoyment in spiritual life. His participation in spiritual life with the Supreme Lord is calledr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101.",
            "We have often heard of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101with the cowherd girls in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. That is not like ordinary exchanges that take place between these material bodies. Rather it is an exchange of feelings through spiritual bodies. One has to be somewhat intelligent to understand this, for a foolish man, who cannot understand what real happiness is, seeks happiness in this material world. In India there is the story of a man who did not know what sugarcane was and was told that it was very sweet to chew. \u201cOh, what does it look like?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt looks just like a bamboo rod,\u201d someone said. So the foolish man began to chew all kinds of bamboo rods. How can he begin to experience the sweetness of sugarcane? Similarly, we are trying to get happiness and pleasure, but we are trying for them by chewing this material body; therefore there is no happiness and no pleasure. For the time being there may be some little feeling of pleasure, but that is not actual pleasure, for it is temporary. It is like a show of lightning which we may see flashing in the sky that may momentarily seem like lightning, but the real lightning is beyond that. Because a person does not really know what happiness is, he deviates from real happiness.",
            "The process for establishing oneself in real happiness is this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we can gradually develop our real intelligence and naturally enjoy relishing spiritual happiness as we make spiritual progress. As we begin to relish spiritual happiness, we proportionately abandon material happiness. As we make progress in understanding the Absolute Truth, we naturally become detached from this false happiness. If somehow or other one is promoted to that stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, what is the result?",
            "ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25yasmin sthito na du\u1e25khenaguru\u1e47\u0101pi vic\u0101lyate",
            "\u201cUpon gaining this, he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty.\u201d (G\u012bt\u01016.22)",
            "When one attains that stage, other achievements appear insignificant. In this material world we are trying to achieve so many things \u2013 riches, women, fame, beauty, knowledge, etc. \u2013 but as soon as we are situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we think, \u201cOh, no achievement is better than this.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so potent that a little taste can save one from the greatest danger. As one begins to relish the taste of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he begins to see other so-called enjoyments and attainments as flat and tasteless. And if one is situated firmly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the greatest danger cannot disturb him. There are so many dangers in life because the material world is a place of danger. We tend to close our eyes to this, and because we are foolish we try to adjust to these dangers. We may have many dangerous moments in our lives, but if we are training ourselves in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and preparing ourselves to go home, back to Godhead, we will not care for them. Our attitude will then be: \u201cDangers come and go \u2013 so let them happen.\u201d It is very difficult to make this kind of adjustment as long as one is on the materialistic platform and is identifying with the gross body, which is composed of perishable elements. But the more one advances in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the more he becomes free from bodily designations and this material entanglement.",
            "In\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthe material world is compared to a great ocean. Within this material universe there are millions and billions of planets floating in space, and we can just imagine how many Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are there. In fact, the whole material universe is likened to a great ocean of misery, an ocean of birth and death. In order to cross this great ocean of nescience, a strong boat is needed, and that strong boat is the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We should immediately get aboard that boat. We should not hesitate, thinking that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet are very small. The whole universe is simply resting on His leg. For one who takes shelter of His feet, it is said that the material universe is no more significant than a puddle of water found in the impression of a calf\u2019s hoofprint. There is certainly no difficulty in crossing over such a small puddle.",

            "\u201cOne should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination and faith and not be deviated from the path. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of mental speculation and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind. Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence sustained by full conviction, and thus the mind should be \ufb01xed on the Self alone and should think of nothing else. From wherever the mind wanders due to its \ufb02ickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01016.24\u201326)",
            "The mind is always disturbed. It is going sometimes this way and sometimes that way. By yoga practice we literally drag the mind to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The mind strays from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to so many exterior objects because from time immemorial, life after life, that has been our practice. Due to this, there may be great difficulty in the beginning when one tries to fix his mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but these difficulties can all be overcome.",
            "It is because the mind is agitated and not fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that it goes from one thought to another. For instance, when we are engaged in work, memories of events that happened ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago may suddenly come to our mind for no apparent reason. These thoughts come from our subconscious, and because they are always rising, the mind is always agitated. If we agitate a lake or a pond, all the mud from the bottom comes to the surface. Similarly, when the mind is agitated so many thoughts arise from the subconscious that have been stored there over the years. If we do not disturb a pond, the mud will settle to the bottom. This yoga process is the means to quiet the mind and allow all these thoughts to settle. For this reason there are so many rules and regulations to follow in order to keep the mind from becoming agitated. If we follow the rules and regulations, gradually the mind will come under control. There are so many don\u2019ts and so many dos, and if one is serious about training the mind, he has to follow them. If he acts whimsically, what is the possibility of the mind being controlled? When the mind is finally trained to the point where it will think of nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it will attain peace and will become very tranquil.",

            "\u201cThe yogi whose mind is \ufb01xed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness. He is beyond the mode of passion, he realizes his qualitative identity with the Supreme, and thus he is freed from all reactions to past deeds.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01016.27)",
            "The mind is always concocting objects for happiness. I am always thinking, \u201cThis will make me happy,\u201d or \u201cThat will make me happy. Happiness is here. Happiness is there.\u201d In this way the mind is taking us anywhere and everywhere. It is as though we are riding on a chariot behind an unbridled horse. We have no power over where we are going but can only sit in horror and watch helplessly. As soon as the mind is engaged in the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 specifically by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 then the wild horses of the mind will gradually come under our control. We must engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service every moment of our lives in order to keep the restless and turbulent mind from dragging us from one object to another in a vain search for happiness in the temporary material world.",

As stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the real friend of every living entity, and we have to revive our friendship with Him. The method for reviving this friendship is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mundane passionate hankering will come to a stop. This passionate hankering keeps us divorced from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is within us and is waiting for us to turn to Him, but we are too busy passionately eating the fruits of the tree of material desire. This passionate compulsion to enjoy these fruits must stop, and we must situate ourselves in our real identity as Brahman \u2013 pure spirit."

This is transcendental sound vibration. It will help us to cleanse the dust from the mirror of the mind. At the present moment we have accumulated so much material dust on the mirror of the mind, just as on Second Avenue (New York City) there is dust and soot over everything due to the heavy traffic. Due to our manipulation of material activities, a great deal of dust has collected over our mind\u2019s clear mirror, and as a consequence we are unable to see things in perspective. This vibration of transcendental sound (the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra) will cleanse away this dust and enable us to see clearly our real constitutional position. As soon as we come to understand \u201cI am not this body; I am spirit soul, and my symptom is consciousness,\u201d we will be able to establish ourselves in real happiness. As our consciousness is purified by this process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all our material miseries will disappear. There is a fire that is always blazing over this material world, and everyone is trying to extinguish it, but there is no possibility of extinguishing this fire of the miseries of material nature unless we are situated in our pure consciousness, in our spiritual life.",
            "One of the purposes for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s descent or appearance in this material world is to extinguish the fire of material existence for all living entities by setting forth thedharma.",

            "In this verse the worddharmais used. This word has been translated into English in various ways. Sometimes it is translated as \u201cfaith,\u201d but according to Vedic literature,dharmais not a kind of faith. Faith may change, butdharmacannot be changed. The liquidity of water cannot be changed. If it is changed \u2013 if, for instance, water becomes solid \u2013 it is actually no longer in its constitutional position. It is existing under a certain qualifying condition. Ourdharma,or constitutional position, is that we are part and parcel of the Supreme, and this being the case, we have to dovetail or subjugate our consciousness to the Supreme.",
            "This position of transcendental service to the Supreme Whole is being misused due to material contact. Service is implicit in our constitutional position. Everyone is a servant, and no one is a master. Everyone is serving someone or other. Although the president may be the chief executive of the state, still he is serving the state, and when his services are no longer required, the state disposes of him. To think to oneself, \u201cI am the master of all I survey,\u201d is calledm\u0101y\u0101,illusion. Thus in material consciousness our service is being misused under various designations. When we can become free from these designations, that is to say, when the dust has been cleared from the mirror of the mind, we will be able to see ourselves in our actual position as eternal servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "One should not think that his service in the material world and his service in the spiritual atmosphere are the same. We may shudder to think, \u201cOh, after liberation will I still be a servant?\u201d This is because we have experience that being a servant in the material world is not very enjoyable, but transcendental service is not like this. In the spiritual world there is no difference between the servant and the master. Here, of course, there is distinction, but in the absolute world everything is one. For instance, in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we can see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has taken the position of servant as the chariot driver of Arjuna. In his constitutional position, Arjuna is the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but in behavior we can see that sometimes the Lord becomes the servant of the servant. So we should be careful not to carry materialistic ideas into the spiritual realm. Whatever we have materially experienced is but a perverted reflection of things in spiritual life.",
            "When our constitutional position, ordharma,is deteriorated due to the contaminations of matter, the Lord Himself comes as an incarnation or sends some of His confidential servitors. Lord Jesus Christ called himself the \u201cson of God,\u201d and so is a representative of the Supreme. Similarly, Mohammed identified himself as a servant of the Supreme Lord. Thus whenever there is a discrepancy in our constitutional position, the Supreme Lord either comes Himself or sends His representative to inform us of the real position of the living entity.",
            "Therefore, one should not make the mistake of thinking thatdharmais a created faith. In its proper sense,dharmacannot be divorced from the living entity at all. It is to the living entity what sweetness is to sugar, or saltiness is to salt, or solidity is to stone. In no case can it be cut off. Thedharmaof the living entity is to serve, and we can easily see that every living entity has the tendency to serve himself or others. How to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, how to disentangle ourselves from materialistic service, how to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become free from material designations is all taught as a science by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

            "On the mundane platform, what is morality for one person is immorality for another, and what is immorality for one person is morality for another. According to the Hindu conception, the drinking of wine is immoral, whereas in the Western world, wine drinking is not considered immoral but is a common thing. So morality is dependent on time, place, circumstance, social position, etc. There is, however, a sense of morality and immorality in all societies. In this verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that even if one is engaged in immoral acts but at the same time is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is to be considered as\u0101dhuor a saint. In other words, although a person may have some immoral habits due to his past association, if he is engaged fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, these habits are not to be considered important. Whatever the case, if one becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he will gradually be purified and will become as\u0101dhu.As one progresses in executing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his bad habits diminish and he attains to saintly perfection.",
            "In this regard there is the story of a thief who went on a pilgrimage to a holy town, and en route he and the other pilgrims stopped to rest overnight at an inn. Being addicted to stealing, the thief began making plans to steal the other pilgrims\u2019 baggage, but he thought, \u201cI\u2019m going on a pilgrimage, so it doesn\u2019t seem appropriate that I should steal this baggage. No, I shall not do it.\u201d Nonetheless, due to his habit, he could not keep his hands off the baggage. So he picked up one person\u2019s bag and placed it in another place, and then another person\u2019s bag and placed it elsewhere. He spent all night placing different bags in different places, but his conscience bothered him so that he could not take anything from them. In the morning, when the other pilgrims awoke, they looked around for their bags and couldn\u2019t find them. There was a great row, and eventually, one by one, they began to find the bags in various places. After they were all found, the thief explained: \u201cGentlemen, I am a thief by occupation. Being that I am habituated to stealing at night, I wanted to steal something from your bags, but I thought that since I am going to this holy place, it is not possible to steal. So I may have rearranged the baggage, but please excuse me.\u201d This is the characteristic of a bad habit. He does not want to commit theft anymore, but because he is habituated, sometimes he does. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that one who has decided to refrain from his immoral habits and make progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to be considered as\u0101dhu,even if out of past habit or by chance he yields to his fault. In the next verse we find that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says:",
            "k\u1e63ipra\u1e41 bhavati dharm\u0101tm\u0101\u015ba\u015bvac-ch\u0101nti\u1e41 nigacchatikaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhina me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati",
            "\u201cHe quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01019.31)",
            "Because one has committed himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is proclaimed here by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that within a very short time he will become saintly. One may pull the plug out of an electric fan, and the fan may still go on even though the juice has been disconnected, but it is understood that the fan will soon come to a stop. Once we take shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we turn the switch off for our karmic activities, and although these activities may still revolve, it is to be understood that they will quickly diminish. It is a fact that whoever takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not have to endeavor independently to become a good man. All the good qualifications will automatically come. It is stated in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthat one who has attained K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has simultaneously attained all good qualities. On the other hand, if a person is devoid of God consciousness and yet has many good qualities, his good qualities are to be considered useless, for he will not in any way be prohibited from doing that which is undesirable. If one is devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is sure to commit mischief in this material world.",

            "\u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01014.9)",
            "The mission for which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears is here further explained. When He comes with some mission, there are some activities. Of course there are some philosophers who do not believe that God comes as an incarnation. They say, \u201cWhy should God come to this rotten world?\u201d But from theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we understand otherwise. We should always remember that we read theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as scripture, and whatever is spoken in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101must be accepted, otherwise there is no reason in reading it. In theG\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He has come as an incarnation with a mission, and along with His mission there are some activities. We can see, for example, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is active as chariot-driver for Arjuna and engages in so many activities on the battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. just as when there is war one person or nation may side with another person or nation and show partiality, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the battlefield shows some partiality and sides with Arjuna. Actually, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not partial to anyone, but externally it appears that He is partial. This partiality, however, should not be accepted in the ordinary sense.",
            "In this verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also points out that His descent into the material world is transcendental. The worddivyammeans transcendental. His activities are not in any way ordinary. Even today, in India, at the end of August the people are accustomed to celebrating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birthday, regardless of sect, just as in the Western world Jesus Christ\u2019s birthday is celebrated at Christmas. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birthday is called Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, and in this verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a uses the wordjanmain referring to \u201cMy birth.\u201d Because there is birth, there are some activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth and activities are transcendental, which means they are not like ordinary births and activities. One may ask how it is that His activities are transcendental. He is born, He takes part in a battle with Arjuna, He has a father by the name of Vasudeva and a mother, Devak\u012b, and a family \u2013 what can be considered transcendental? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25 \u2013we must know of His birth and activities in truth. When one knows of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth and activities in truth, the result is:tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\u2013 when he leaves this material body, he is not born again but goes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This means that he becomes a liberated soul. He goes to the eternal spiritual world and attains his constitutional position full of bliss, knowledge, and eternality. All this can be obtained simply by knowing in truth the transcendental nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth and activities.",
            "Ordinarily when one quits the body he has to take up another body. The lives of the living entities are going on simply due to the living entities\u2019 changing dress from one body to another \u2013 transmigration of the soul \u2013 according to the work of the living entities. At the present moment we may think that this material body is our actual body, but it is like a dress. In reality we do have an actual body, a spiritual body. This material body is superficial compared to the real spiritual body of the living entity. When this material body becomes old and worn out, or when it is rendered useless by some accident, we put it aside as we might put aside a soiled or ruined suit and take up another material body.",

Then it grows to become a baby, then a child, a young boy, a youth, a grown man, and an old man, and finally, when it becomes useless, the living entity changes into another body. The body is therefore always changing, and death is simply the ultimate change of the present body.",

            "\u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01012.13)",
            "Although the body is changing, the dweller within the body remains the same. Although the boy grows into manhood, the living entity within the body is not changed. It is not that the self who was there as a boy has gone away. Medical science agrees that at every moment the material body is changing. Just as living entities are not bewildered by this, an enlightened man is not bewildered when the body undergoes its ultimate change at death. But a person who does not understand things as they are laments. In the material condition we are simply changing bodies all the time; that is our disease. It is not that we always change to a human body. We may change to an animal body or a demigod body depending on our activities. According to thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47athere are  8,400,000 species of life. We can take on any of them at death. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a promises that one who knows His birth and activities in truth is freed from this cycle of transmigration.",
            "How does one understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth and activities in truth? This is explained in the eighteenth chapter of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:",

            "Here again the wordtattvata\u1e25,\u201cin truth,\u201d is used. One can understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth by becoming a devotee. He who is not a devotee, who does not strive for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, cannot understand. At the beginning of the fourth chapter also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna(G\u012bt\u01014.3)that He is explaining this ancient science of yoga to him because Arjuna is \u201cMy devotee and My friend.\u201d For one who simply makes an academic study of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remains a mystery. TheBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is not a book that one can just purchase from the bookstore and understand by scholarship alone. Arjuna was not a great scholar, nor a Ved\u0101ntist, nor a philosopher, nor abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,nor a renunciant; he was a family and military man. But still K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a selected him to be the recipient of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the first authority in the disciplic succession. Why? \u201cBecause you are My devotee.\u201d That is the qualification to understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101as it is and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is \u2013 one must become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
            "And what is this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness? That is the process of cleansing the dust from the mirror of the mind through the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. By chanting this mantra and by hearing theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,we can gradually attain to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always present within our heart. The individual soul and the Supersoul are both sitting in the tree of the body. The individual soul (j\u012bva) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101) is witnessing. As the individual soul begins the process of devotional service and gradually begins to develop his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the Supersoul who is seated within begins to help him dust all the impurities from the mirror of the mind. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a friend to all saintly persons, and the attempt to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is a saintly endeavor.\u015arava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam\u2013 by chanting and hearing one can come to understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thereby come to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And upon understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can, at the moment of death, go immediately to His abode in the spiritual world. This spiritual world is described thus in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:",

The word darkness has a twofold meaning; it not only means without light, but it means ignorance.",
            "The Supreme Lord has manifold energies. It is not that he comes to this material world to perform activities. It is stated in theVedasthat the Supreme Lord has nothing to do. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says:",

            "We should therefore not think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is required to descend upon this material world and engage in so many activities. No one is equal to or greater than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He has all knowledge naturally. It is not that He has to undergo penances to acquire knowledge or that He at any time has to receive knowledge or attain knowledge. At all times and in all conditions He is full of knowledge. He may be speaking theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to Arjuna, but at no time was He ever taught theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.One who can understand that this is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s position does not have to return to the cycle of birth and death in this material world. Being under the influence of illusion, we spend our lifetimes trying to make adjustments to this material atmosphere, but this is not the purpose of human life. Human life is meant for understanding the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
            "Our material needs are these: the problem of eating, of mating, of sleeping, of defending ourselves, and of acquiring sense gratification. These are common both to human beings and to animals. The animals are busily engaged trying to solve these problems, and if we are also only engaged in solving them how are we any different from the animals? The human being, however, has a special qualification whereby he can develop transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but if he does not avail himself of this, he is in the animal category. The defect of modern civilization is that it puts too much stress on solving these survival problems. As spiritual living beings it is incumbent upon us to extricate ourselves from this entanglement of birth and death. We should therefore be careful not to miss the special opportunity of human life. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself comes to deliver theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and to help us to become God conscious. Indeed, this very material creation is given to us to utilize for this cultivation. But if after receiving this chance and this gift of human life we do not utilize them to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we shall be missing this rare opportunity. The process for cultivation is very simple:\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam\u2013 hearing and chanting. We have nothing to do other than listen, and by listening carefully, enlightenment is sure to come. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will surely help, for He is seated within. We only have to make the effort and spare a little time. We will not need anyone to ask us whether we are making progress. We will know it automatically, just as a hungry man knows that he has been satisfied by a full meal.",
            "Actually this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or self-realization is not very difficult. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a taught it to Arjuna in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,and if we understand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101just as Arjuna did, we will have no problem in coming to the perfectional state. But if we try to interpret theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101according to our own mundane academic mentality, we spoil it all.",
            "As stated before, this chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a process by which all contaminations due to material association are removed from the mirror of the mind. There is no need for external help in reviving our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is dormant within the self. In fact, it is the very quality of the self. We have only to invoke it by this process. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is an eternal fact. It is not a doctrine or set of beliefs imposed by some organization. It is within all living entities, whether they be human being or animal. When Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was passing through the jungles of South India some five hundred years ago, He chanted Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and all the animals\u2013the tigers, elephants, and deer\u2013joined Him in dancing to the holy names. Of course, this depends on the purity of the chanting. As we progress in chanting, purification is sure to come."

            "In our practical life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructs us how to invoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is not that we are to stop executing our duty or to cease from activity. Rather, activities have to be conducted in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Everyone has a vocation in life, but with what consciousness does he enter upon it? Everyone is thinking, \u201cOh, I must have a vocation in order to maintain my family.\u201d Society, the government, or the family have to be satisfied, and no one is free from such consciousness. One has to be in proper consciousness to execute any activity nicely. He whose consciousness is agitated, who is like a madman, cannot execute any duty. We should execute our duty properly, but we should do it thinking to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not that we have to change our process of work, but we do have to understand for whom we are working. Whatever activity we have to do we must execute, but we should not be carried away byk\u0101ma,desire. The Sanskrit wordk\u0101mais used to indicate lust, desire, or sense satisfaction. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructs that we should not work for the satisfaction ofk\u0101ma,or our own lust. The whole teaching of theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is based on this principle.",
            "Arjuna wanted to satisfy his senses by refraining from fighting with his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke to him to convince him to execute his duty for the satisfaction of the Supreme. Materially it may seem very pious that he is giving up his claim for a kingdom and refusing to kill his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not approve of this because the principle for Arjuna\u2019s decision was to satisfy his own senses. One\u2019s business or occupation need not be changed \u2013 as Arjuna\u2019s was not changed \u2013 but one does have to change his consciousness. In order to change this consciousness, however, knowledge is required. That knowledge is knowing \u201cI am part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the superior energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d That is real knowledge. Relative knowledge may teach us how to repair a machine, but real knowledge is knowing our position as being integral with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being part of Him, our pleasure, which is partial, is dependent on the whole. For instance, my hand can take pleasure when it is attached to my body and serves it. It does not take pleasure in serving another\u2019s body. Because we are part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, our pleasure is in serving Him. \u201cI cannot be happy serving you,\u201d everyone is thinking. \u201cI can only be happy serving myself.\u201d But no one knows who the self is. That self is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

But if he himself is bound by ignorance, how can he untie others who are similarly bound? Before one can make others free, he must be free himself.

Finally R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya quoted a Vedic aphorism which recommended that one give up all unnecessary endeavor in mental speculation for understanding God because by speculation it is not possible to arrive at the ultimate truth. Scientists, for instance, may speculate about distant stars and planets, but they can never come to any conclusions without experience. One may go on speculating throughout his life and never reach any conclusions.",

It is recommended instead that one become submissive, realizing that not only is he an insignificant creature, but that this earth is only one small point in the great universe. New York City may seem very large, but when one realizes that the earth is such a small spot, and that on the earth the United States is just another small spot, and that in the United States New York City is but a small spot, and that in New York the individual is only one out of millions, then one can understand that he is not so very important after all. Realizing our insignificance in the face of the universe and God, we should not be artificially puffed-up but should be submissive. We should be very careful not to fall prey to the frog philosophy. Once there was a frog in a well, and upon being informed of the existence of the Atlantic Ocean by a friend, he asked the friend, \u201cOh, what is this Atlantic Ocean?\u201d",

            "\u201cHow vast? Is it double the size of this well?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no, much, much larger,\u201d his friend replied.",
            "\u201cHow much larger? Ten times the size?\u201d In this way the frog went on calculating. But what is the possibility of his ever understanding the depths and far reaches of the great ocean? Our faculties, experience, and powers of speculation are always limited. We can only give rise to such frog philosophy. Therefore\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamrecommends that we give up the method of speculation as a waste of time in trying to understand the Supreme.",
            "After giving up speculation, what should we do? TheBh\u0101gavatamrecommends that we become submissive and hear the message of God submissively. This message may be found also in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and other Vedic literatures, in the Bible or Koran \u2013 in any bona fide scripture \u2013 or it may be heard from a realized soul.

Arjuna was a friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although the Supreme Godhead, became Arjuna\u2019s chariot driver, a menial servant. Arjuna loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocated his love in this way. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a child, He playfully took the shoes of His father, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and put them on His head. People may try very hard to become one with God, but actually we can surpass that \u2013 we can become the father of God. Of course, God is the father of all creatures, and He has no father Himself, but He accepts His devotee, His lover, as a father. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a agrees to be conquered by His devotee out of love. All one has to do is hear the message of the Lord very carefully.",

            "The elephant and the gorilla are very strong animals, and we should understand that they get their strength from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The human being cannot acquire such strength by his own endeavor, but if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so favors, a man can get strength to exceed the elephant thousands of times. The great warrior Bh\u012bma, who fought in the battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, was said to have strength ten thousand times that of an elephant. Similarly, desire or lust (k\u0101ma) that is not against religious principles should also be seen as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. What is this lust? Lust generally means sex life, but herek\u0101marefers to sex life which is not against religious principles \u2013 that is to say, sex for the begetting of good children. If one can beget good K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children, he can have sex thousands of times, but if he can only beget children who are raised in the consciousness of cats and dogs, his sex life is to be considered irreligious. In religious and civilized societies, marriage is intended as an indication that a couple is to engage in sex for begetting good children. Therefore married sex life is considered religious, and unmarried sex life is considered irreligious. Actually there is no difference between thesanny\u0101s\u012band the householder provided that the householder\u2019s sexual activities are based on religious principles.",

I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.\u201d(G\u012bt\u01017.12)",
            "One may question K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way: \u201cYou say You are sound, water, illumination, fragrance, the seed of all, strength, andk\u0101ma,desire \u2013 does that mean that you exist simply in the mode of goodness?\u201d In the material world there are the modes of goodness, passion, and ignorance. Thus far K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described Himself as that which is good (for instance, sex in marriage according to religious principles). But what about the other modes? Does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not exist in them? In answer, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a replies that whatever is seen in the material world is due to an interaction of the three modes of material nature. Whatever can be observed is a combination of goodness, passion, or ignorance, and in all cases these three states are \u201cproduced by Me.\u201d Because they are produced by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their position is in Him, but He is not in them, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is transcendental to the three modes. Thus, in another sense, bad and evil things, which are produced out of ignorance, are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when they are applied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. How is this? For example, an electrical engineer is producing electrical energy. In our homes we are experiencing this electrical energy as coldness in the refrigerator or heat in the electric stove, but at the power plant, electrical energy is neither cold nor hot. The manifestations of this energy may be different for the living entities, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they are not different. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sometimes acts on what appears to be the principles of passion or ignorance, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as for the electrical engineer electrical energy is simply electricity and nothing else. He makes no distinction that this is \u201ccold electricity\u201d or that is \u201chot electricity.\u201d",
            "Everything is being generated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

What the living entity is considering to be bad or good is only so for the living entity, for he is conditioned. But because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not conditioned, for Him there is no question of bad or good. Because we are conditioned, we are suffering from dualities, but for Him everything is perfect."

Why am I suffering?\u201d When this question arises, there is a chance to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
            "As soon as we surrender ourselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He welcomes us very cordially. It is just like a lost child who returns to his father and says, \u201cMy dear father, due to some misunderstanding I left your protection, but I have suffered. Now I return to you.\u201d The father embraces his son and says, \u201cMy dear boy, come on. I was so anxious for you all the days you were gone, and now I\u2019m so happy you have come back.\u201d The father is so kind. We are in the same position. We have to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and it is not very difficult. When the son surrenders to the father, is it a very difficult job? It is very natural, and the father is always waiting to receive the son. There is no question of insult. If we bow down before our Supreme Father and touch His feet, there is no harm for us, nor is it difficult. Indeed, it is glorious for us. Why should we not? By surrendering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we come immediately under His protection and are relieved of all miseries. This is validated by all scriptures.

However, we have become so accustomed to being kicked that we think it is all right and consider it to be the ordinary course of things. We have become very proud of our education, but we tell material nature, \u201cThank you very much for kicking me. Now please continue.\u201d Thus deluded, we think we have even conquered material nature. But how is this so? Nature is still inflicting on us the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death.

Although there are no disadvantages to surrendering to the Father, people who are thus characterized never do it. As a result they are constantly punished by the agents of the Father. They have to be slapped, caned, and kicked severely, and they have to suffer. Just as a father has to chastise his unruly boy, so material nature has to employ certain punishments. At the same time nature is nourishing us by supplying food and other necessities. Both processes are going on because we are sons of the wealthiest Father of all, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is kind even though we do not surrender to Him.

Thus the killing process has been accelerated. We are so proud to think that this is advancement of knowledge, but if we can manufacture something that can stop death, we have really advanced in knowledge.

The wise man realizes this and does not pray for relief from material miseries. Rather, he prays to glorify God and inform others how great He is. He doesn\u2019t pray for his personal interest, for bread, dress, or shelter. The pure devotee, when he is distressed, says, \u201cDear Lord, this is Your kindness.

Socrates, for instance, who believed in the immortality of the soul, was condemned to death, and upon being asked how he would like to be buried, replied, \u201cFirst of all you may have to catch me.\u201d So one who knows he is not the body is not disturbed, for he knows the soul cannot be caught, tortured, killed, or buried. He who is conversant with the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows perfectly well that he is not the body, that he is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that his real relationship is with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that somehow or other, although he has been put in the material body, he must remain aloof from the three qualities of material nature. He is not concerned with the modes of goodness, passion, or ignorance but with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who understands this is aj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b,a wise man, and he is very much dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A distressed man, when he is put into opulence, may forget God, but aj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b,who knows the real position of God, will never forget Him.",
            "There is a class ofj\u00f1\u0101n\u012bscalled impersonalists who say that because worshiping the impersonal is too difficult, a form of God has to be imagined. These are not realj\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs \u2013they\u2019re fools. No one can imagine the form of God, for God is so great. One may imagine some form, but that is a concoction; it is not the real form. There are those who imagine the form of God, and there are those who deny the form of God. Neither is aj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b.Those who imagine the form are called iconoclasts. During the Hindu-Muslim riots in India, some Hindus would go to the Muslim mosque and break statues and images of God, and the Muslims would reciprocate in like manner. In this way they were both thinking, \u201cWe\u2019ve killed the Hindu God. We\u2019ve killed the Moslem God,\u201d etc. Similarly, when Gandhi was leading his resistance movement, many Indians would go to the street and destroy the mailboxes and in this way think they were destroying the government postal service. People of such mentality are notj\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs.The religious wars between the Hindus and Muslims and Christians and non-Christians were all conducted on the basis of ignorance. One who is in knowledge knows that God is one; He cannot be Muslim, Hindu, or Christian.",
            "It is our imagination that God is such and such and such and such. That is all imagination. The real wise man knows that God is transcendental. One who knows that God is transcendental to the material modes truly knows God. God is always beside us, present in our hearts. When we leave the body, God also goes with us, and when we take on another body, He goes with us there just to see what we are doing. When shall we turn our face toward Him? He is always waiting. As soon as we turn our face toward God, He says, \u201cMy dear son, come on \u2013sa ca mama priya\u1e25 \u2013you are eternally dear to Me. Now you are turning your face to Me, and I am very glad.\u201d",
            "The wise man, thej\u00f1\u0101n\u012b,actually understands the science of God. One who only understands that \u201cGod is good\u201d is in a preliminary stage, but one who actually understands how great and good God is, is further progressed. That knowledge is to be had in\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamand theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.One who is actually interested in God should study the science of God, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

            "The knowledge of God imparted in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is very subtle and confidential. It is full ofj\u00f1\u0101na,metaphysical wisdom, andvij\u00f1\u0101na,scientific knowledge. And it is full of mystery also. How can one understand this knowledge? It must be imparted by God Himself or a bona fide representative of God. Therefore \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that whenever there is a discrepancy on understanding the science of God, He incarnates Himself.",
            "Nor does knowledge come from sentiment. Devotion is not sentiment; it is a science. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cA show of spirituality without reference to the Vedic knowledge is simply a disturbance to society.\u201d One must taste the nectar of devotion by reason, argument, and knowledge, and then he must pass it on to others. One should not think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is mere sentimentality. The dancing and singing are all scientific. There is science, and there is also loving reciprocation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very dear to the wise man, and the wise man is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will return our love a thousandfold. What capacity do we finite creatures have to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has immense capacity \u2013 unlimited capacity \u2013 for love."

            "Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is saying that all the men who come to Him \u2013 whether they be distressed, in need of money, curious, etc. \u2013 are welcomed, but out of them the person who is in knowledge is very dear to Him. The others are welcomed because it is understood that in course of time, if they continue on the path to God, they will become as good as the man of knowledge. Generally, however, it so happens that when one goes to church for profit, and the money doesn\u2019t come, he concludes that approaching God is nonsense and he gives up all connection with church. That is the danger of approaching God with ulterior motives. For instance, during World War II it was reported that many wives of the German soldiers went to church to pray for their husbands\u2019 safe return, but when they found their husbands had been killed in battle, they became atheistic. Thus we want God to become our order-supplier, and when He does not supply our order we say there is no God. That is the effect of praying for material things.",
            "In this connection there is a story of a little boy, about five years old, named Dhruva, who belonged to a royal family. In the course of time his father, the king, tired of his mother and deposed her as his queen. He then took another woman as queen, and she became stepmother to the boy. She was very envious of Dhruva, and one day, as Dhruva was sitting on the father\u2019s knee, she insulted him. \u201cOh, you cannot sit on the lap of your father,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you are not born of me.\u201d She dragged Dhruva from his father\u2019s lap and the boy became very angry. He was the son of ak\u1e63atriya,andk\u1e63atriyasare notorious for their quick tempers. Dhruva took this to be a great insult, and he went to his mother who had been deposed.",

            "\u201cOh, where is God?\u201d Dhruva asked enthusiastically.",
            "\u201cI understand so many sages go to the jungle and forest to see God,\u201d the mother replied. \u201cThey undergo great penances and austerities in order to find God there.\u201d",
            "At once Dhruva went to the forest and began asking the tiger and the elephant, \u201cOh, are you God? Are you God?\u201d In this way he was questioning all the animals. Seeing that Dhruva was very much inquisitive, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sent N\u0101rada Muni to see about the situation. N\u0101rada quickly went to the forest and found Dhruva.",
            "\u201cMy dear boy,\u201d N\u0101rada said, \u201cyou belong to the royal family. You cannot suffer all this penance and austerity. Please return to your home. Your mother and father are very much anxious for you.\u201d",
            "\u201cPlease don\u2019t try to divert me in that way,\u201d the boy said. \u201cIf you know something about God, or if you know how I can see God, please tell me. Otherwise go away and don\u2019t disturb me.\u201d",
            "When N\u0101rada saw that Dhruva was so determined, he initiated him as a disciple and gave him the mantra,o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya.Dhruva chanted this mantra and became perfect, and God came before him.",
            "\u201cMy dear Dhruva, what do you want? You can take from Me whatever you want.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy dear Lord,\u201d the boy replied, \u201cI was undergoing such severe penances simply for my father\u2019s kingdom and land, but now I have seen You. Even the great sages and saints cannot see You. What is my profit? I left my home to find merely some scraps of glass and rubbish, and instead I have found a very valuable diamond. Now I am satisfied. I have no need to ask anything of You.\u201d",
            "Thus even though one may be poverty-stricken or in distress, if he goes to God with the same determination as Dhruva, intent on seeing God and taking His benediction, and if he happens to see God, he will no longer want anything material. He comes to understand the foolishness of material possessions, and he puts the illusion aside for the real thing. When one becomes situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he becomes fully satisfied and doesn\u2019t want anything.",
            "Thej\u00f1\u0101n\u012b,the wise man, knows that material things are flickering. He also knows that there are three aspects that complicate all material gain \u2013 one wants profit from his work, one wants adoration from others because of his riches, and one wants fame because of his wealth. In any case, he knows that all of these apply but to the body and that when the body is finished, they also go. When the body dies, one is no longer a rich man but a spirit soul, and according to his work, he has to enter another body. TheG\u012bt\u0101says that a wise man is not bewildered by this, for he knows what is what. Why then should he bother himself in attaining material wealth? His attitude is, \u201cI have an eternal connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord. Now let me establish that relationship firmly so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will take me back to His kingdom.\u201d",
            "The cosmic situation is giving us all facility to reestablish this relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and return to Godhead. This should be our mission in life. Everything we need is being supplied by God \u2013 land, grain, fruits, milk, shelter, and clothing. We only have to live peacefully and cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That should be our mission in life. We should therefore be satisfied with what God has supplied in the form of food, shelter, defense, and sex, and should not want more and more and more. The best type of civilization is one that ascribes to the maxim of \u201cplain living and high thinking.\u201d It is not possible to manufacture food or sex in a factory. These and whatever else we require are supplied by God. Our business is to take advantage of these things and become God conscious.",

We are short-lived, and there are so many people without food, shelter, married life, or defense from the onslaughts of nature. This is due to the influence of this Age of Kali.

            "Philosophical research into the science of God has to be prosecuted for many births. God realization is very easy, but at the same time it is very difficult. It is easy for those who accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s word as truth, but those who try to understand through research work, by dint of advancement of knowledge, have to create their faith after finishing so much research work, and this process takes many births. There are different types of transcendentalists, calledtattvavit,who know the Absolute Truth. The transcendentalists call the Absolute Truth that in which there is no duality. In the Absolute Truth there is no duality \u2013 everything is on the same level. One who knows this in truth is calledtattvavit.",
            "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims that the Absolute Truth is known in three aspects \u2013Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101,andBhagav\u0101n \u2013the impersonalBrahmaneffulgence, the localized Supersoul, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus there are three angles from which one may envision the Absolute Truth. One may view a mountain from a great distance and thus perceive it from one angle of vision. As he comes closer, he may see the trees and foliage of the mountain, and if he begins to climb the mountain, he will find so much variegatedness in the trees, plants, and animals. The objective is the same, but due to different angles of vision sages have different conceptions of the Absolute Truth. Another example: there is the sunshine, the sun disc, and the sun god. One who is in the sunshine cannot claim that he is on the sun itself, and one who is situated in the sun is, from the point of view of vision, better situated. The sunshine may be compared to the all-pervasivebrahmajyotieffulgence, the localized sun disc may be compared to the localized aspect of the Supersoul, and the sun god who resides in the sun may be compared to the Personality of Godhead. As on this earth planet we have a multivariety of living entities, we can understand from Vedic literatures that in the sun also there is a variety of living entities, but their bodies are made of fire, just as ours are made of earth.",
            "In material nature there are five gross elements: earth, water, air, fire, and space. In different planets there are different atmospheres due to one of these five elements prevailing, and there are different bodies for the living entities composed of whatever element may be predominant in a particular planet. We should not think that all planets have the same quality of life, yet there is uniformity in the sense that these five elements are present in some form or other. Thus on some planets earth is prominent, fire is prominent, water is prominent, and air and space are prominent. We should not think, therefore, that just because a planet is not composed primarily of earth, or because the atmosphere does not duplicate ours, that there is no life on these planets. Vedic literatures give us information that there are countless planets filled with living entities with different types of bodies. As, by making some material adjustment, we may qualify to enter into different material planets, by qualification we can enter into the spiritual planet where the Supreme Lord resides.",

If they take to spirituality, they wish to gain something by spiritual power. It is not uncommon in India for a person to go to a swami and say, \u201cSwamij\u012b, could you give me some medicine? I am suffering from this disease.\u201d He thinks that because a doctor is too expensive, he can go to a swami who can work miracles. In India also there are swamis who go to people\u2019s houses and preach, \u201cIf you give me one ounce of gold I can make it into one hundred ounces of gold.\u201d The people think, \u201cI have five ounces of gold. Let me give it to him, and I\u2019ll get five hundred ounces.\u201d In this way the swami collects all the gold in the village, and after collecting it, he vanishes. This is our disease: when we go to a swami, or a temple or church, our hearts are filled with material desires. Wanting some material profit out of spiritual life, we practice yoga just to keep our health fit. But in order to keep healthy, why take shelter of yoga? We can become healthy through regular exercises and regulated diet. Why resort to yoga? Becausek\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25.We have the material desire to keep ourselves fit and to enjoy life by going to church and making God our order-supplier.",
            "Having material desires, men worship various demigods. They have no idea how to get out of matter; they want to utilize the material world to its best capacity. For instance, in Vedic literature there are so many recommendations: if one wants to cure his disease, he worships the sun, or if a girl wants a good husband, she worships Lord \u015aiva, or if one wants to become beautiful, he worships such and such god, or if one wants to become educated, he worships goddess Sarasvat\u012b. In this way Westerners often think that the Hindus are polytheistic, but actually this worship is not to God, but to demigods. We should not think that the demigods are God. God is one, but there are demigods who are also living entities just like us. The difference is that they have a considerable amount of power. On this earth there may be a king or a president or a dictator \u2013 these are men like us, but they have some extraordinary power, and in order to get favors from them, to take advantage of their power, we worship them in one way or another. But theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101condemns worship of the demigods. This verse clearly states that people worship the demigods due tok\u0101ma,material lust.",
            "This material life is simply based on lust; we want to enjoy this world, and we love this material world because we want to gratify our senses. This lust is a perverted reflection of our love of God. In our original constitution we are made to love God, but because we have forgotten God, we love matter. Love is there. Either we love matter, or we love God. But in no case can we get out of this loving propensity; indeed, we often see that when one doesn\u2019t have children, he loves a cat or a dog. Why? Because we want and need to love something. In the absence of reality we put our faith and love in cats and dogs. Love is always there, but it is distorted into the form of lust. When this lust is baffled, we become angry; when we become angry, we become illusioned; and when we are illusioned, we are doomed. This is the process that is going on, but we have to reverse this process and turn lust into love. If we love God, we love everything. But if we do not love God, it is not possible to love anything. We may think that it is love, but it is simply a glamorized form of lust. Those who have become the dogs of lust are said to have lost all good sense:k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25.",
            "There are many rules and regulations for the worship of demigods in the scriptures, and one may question why the Vedic literatures recommended their worship. There is necessity. Those who are motivated by lust want the opportunity to love something, and the demigods are acknowledged as the officers of the Supreme Lord. The idea is that as one worships these demigods, he will gradually develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But if one is completely atheistic and disobedient and rebellious against any authority, what hope is there? So one\u2019s obedience to a higher personality can start with the demigods.",
            "If, however, we take directly to the worship of the Supreme Lord, worship of the demigods is not necessary. Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly show all respect to the demigods, but they do not need to worship them because they know that the supreme authority behind the demigods is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they are engaged in worshiping Him. In any case, respect is still there. A devotee of the Lord shows respect even to an ant, what to speak of the demigods? The devotee is aware that all living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord and that they are playing different roles only.",
            "In relation to the Supreme Lord, all beings are to be respected. Therefore a devotee refers to others as \u201cprabhu,\u201d meaning \u201cMy dear sir, my dear lord.\u201d Submissiveness is a qualification for a devotee of the Lord. Devotees are kind and obedient, and they have all good qualifications. In conclusion, if one becomes a devotee of the Lord, all good qualifications will automatically develop. By nature, the living entity is perfect, but due to the contamination of lust, he becomes vicious. That which is part and parcel of gold is also gold, and whatever is part and parcel of the Complete Perfect is also perfect.",

            "\u201cThe Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete. Because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as a complete whole. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.\u201d (\u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad,Invocation)",
            "Due to the contamination of matter, the perfect living entity falls down, but this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will again make him perfect. Through it, he can become truly happy, and after leaving the material body, enter into the kingdom where there is eternal life, bliss, and full knowledge."
