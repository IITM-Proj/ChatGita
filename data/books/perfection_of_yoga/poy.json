        "chapter_text": "There have beenmanyyogasystems popularized in the Western world, especially in this century, but none of them have actually taught the perfection ofyoga.In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, teaches Arjuna directly the perfection ofyoga.If we actually want to participate in the perfection of theyogasystem, inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101we will find the authoritative statements of the Supreme Person.\n\nIt is certainly remarkable that the perfection ofyogawas taught in the middle of a battlefield. It was taught to Arjuna, the warrior, just before Arjuna was to engage in a fratricidal battle. Out of sentiment, Arjuna was thinking, \u201cWhy should I fight against my own kinsmen?\u201d That reluctance to fight was due to Arjuna\u2019s illusion, and just to eradicate that illusion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to him. One can just imagine how little time must have elapsed whileBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was being spoken. All the warriors on both sides were poised to fight, so there was very little time indeed \u2013 at the utmost, one hour. Within this one hour, the wholeBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was discussed, and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a set forth the perfection of allyogasystems to His friend Arjuna. At the end of this great discourse, Arjuna set aside his misgivings and fought.\n\nHowever, within the discourse, when Arjuna heard the explanation of the meditational system ofyoga \u2013how to sit down, how to keep the body straight, how to keep the eyes half-closed and how to gaze at the tip of the nose without diverting one\u2019s attention, all this being conducted in a secluded place, alone \u2013 he replied,\n\nyo \u2019ya\u1e41 yogas tvay\u0101 prokta\u1e25s\u0101myena madhus\u016bdanaetasy\u0101ha\u1e41 na pa\u015by\u0101mica\u00f1calatv\u0101t sthiti\u1e41 sthir\u0101m\n\n\u201cO Madhus\u016bdana, the system ofyogawhich You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.\u201d(Bg. 6.33)This is important. We must always remember that we are in a material circumstance wherein at every moment our mind is subject to agitation. Actually we are not in a very comfortable situation. We are always thinking that by changing our situation we will overcome our mental agitation, and we are always thinking that when we reach a certain point, all mental agitations will disappear. But it is the nature of the material world that we cannot be free from anxiety. Our dilemma is that we are always trying to make a solution to our problems, but this universe is so designed that these solutions never come.\n\nNot being a cheater, being very frank and open, Arjuna tells K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that the system ofyogawhich He has described is not possible for him to execute. In speaking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is significant that Arjuna addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana, indicating that the Lord is the killer of the demon Madhu. It is notable that God\u2019s names are innumerable, for He is often named according to His activities. Indeed, God has innumerable names because He has innumerable activities. We are only parts of God, and we cannot even remember how many activities we have engaged in from our childhood to the present. The eternal God is unlimited, and since His activities are also unlimited, He has unlimited names, of whichK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ais the chief. Then why is Arjuna addressing Him as Madhus\u016bdana when, being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend, he could address Him directly as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? The answer is that Arjuna considers his mind to be like a great demon, such as the demon Madhu. If it were possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon called the mind, then Arjuna would be able to attain the perfection ofyoga.\u201cMy mind is much stronger than this demon Madhu,\u201d Arjuna is saying. \u201cPlease, if You could kill him, then it would be possible for me to execute thisyogasystem.\u201d Even the mind of a great man like Arjuna is always agitated. As Arjuna himself says,\n\nca\u00f1cala\u1e41 hi mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47apram\u0101thi balavad d\u1e5b\u1e0dhamtasy\u0101ha\u1e41 nigraha\u1e41 manyev\u0101yor iva sudu\u1e63karam\n\n\u201cFor the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.\u201d(Bg. 6.34)\n\nIt is indeed a fact that the mind is always telling us to go here, go there, do this, do that \u2013 it is always telling us which way to turn. Thus the sum and substance of theyogasystem is to control the agitated mind. In the meditationalyogasystem the mind is controlled by focusing on the Supersoul \u2013 that is the whole purpose ofyoga.But Arjuna says that controlling this mind is more difficult than stopping the wind from blowing. One can imagine a man stretching out his arms trying to stop a hurricane. Are we to assume that Arjuna is simply not sufficiently qualified to control his mind? The actual fact is that we cannot begin to understand the immense qualifications of Arjuna. After all, he was a personal friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a highly elevated position and is one that cannot be at all attained by one without great qualifications. In addition to this, Arjuna was renowned as a great warrior and administrator. He was such an intelligent man that he could understandBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101within one hour, whereas at the present moment great scholars cannot even understand it in the course of a lifetime. Yet Arjuna was thinking that controlling the mind was simply not possible for him. Are we then to assume that what was impossible for Arjuna in a more advanced age is possible for us in this degenerate age? We should not for one moment think that we are in Arjuna\u2019s category. We are a thousand times inferior.\n\nMoreover, there is no record of Arjuna\u2019s having executed theyogasystem at any time. Yet Arjuna was praised by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the only man worthy of understandingBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.What was Arjuna\u2019s great qualification? \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cYou are My devotee. You are My very dear friend.\u201d Despite this qualification, Arjuna refused to execute the meditationalyogasystem described by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. What then are we to conclude? Are we to despair the mind\u2019s ever being controlled? No, it can be controlled, and the process is this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The mind must be fixed always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Insofar as the mind is absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it has attained the perfection ofyoga.\n\nNow when we turn to the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,in the Twelfth Canto we find \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b telling Mah\u0101\u00adr\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it that in the golden age, the Satya-yuga, people were living for one hundred thousand years, and at that time, when advanced living entities lived for such lengths of time, it was possible to execute this meditational system ofyoga.But what was achieved in the Satya-yuga by this meditational process, and in the followingyuga,the Tret\u0101-yuga, by the offering of great sacrifices, and in the nextyuga,the Dv\u0101para-yuga, by temple worship, would be achieved at the present time, in this Kali-yuga, by simply chanting the names of God,hari-k\u012brtana,Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So from authoritative sources we learn that this chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is the embodiment of the perfection ofyogafor this age.\n\nToday we have great difficulties living fifty or sixty years. A man may live at the utmost eighty or a hundred years. In addition, these brief years are always fraught with anxiety, with difficulties due to circumstances of war, pestilence, famine and so many other disturbances. We\u2019re also not very intelligent, and, at the same time, we\u2019re unfortunate. These are the characteristics of man living in Kali-yuga, a degraded age. So properly speaking, we can never attain success in this meditationalyogasystem described by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At the utmost we can only gratify our personal whims by some pseudoadaptation of this system. Thus people are paying money to attend some classes in gymnastic exercises and deep-breathing, and they\u2019re happy if they think they can lengthen their lifetimes by a few years or enjoy better sex life. But we must understand that this is not the actualyogasystem. In this age that meditational system cannot be properly executed. Instead, all of the perfections of that system can be realized throughbhakti-yoga,the sublime process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, specificallymantra-yoga,the glorification of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is recommended in Vedic scriptures and is introduced by great authorities like Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Indeed, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101proclaims that themah\u0101tm\u0101s,the great souls, are always chanting the glories of the Lord. If one wants to be amah\u0101tm\u0101in terms of the Vedic literature, in terms ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and in terms of the great authorities, then one has to adopt this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But if we\u2019re content at making a show of meditation by sitting very straight in lotus position and going into a trance like some sort of performer, then that is a different thing. But we should understand that such show-bottle performances have nothing to do with the actual perfection ofyoga.The material disease cannot be cured by artificial medicine. We have to take the real cure straight from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "chapter_title": "Yoga as Work in Devotion",
        "chapter_text": "We have heardthe names of so many differentyogasandyog\u012bs,but inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that the actualyog\u012bis he who has surrendered himself \u201cfully unto Me.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims that there is no difference between renunciation (sanny\u0101sa) andyoga.\n\nya\u1e41 sanny\u0101sam iti pr\u0101huryoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41 viddhi p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davana hy asannyasta-sa\u1e45kalpoyog\u012b bhavati ka\u015bcana\n\n\u201cWhat is called renunciation is the same asyoga,or linking oneself with the Supreme; for no one can become ayog\u012bunless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.\u201d(Bg. 6.2)\n\nInBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101there are three basic types ofyogadelineated \u2013karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yogaandbhakti-yoga.The systems ofyogamay be likened to a staircase. Someone may be on the first step, someone may be halfway up, or someone may be on the top step. When one is elevated to certain levels, he is known as akarma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b,etc. In all cases, the service to the Supreme Lord is the same. It is a difference in elevation only. Thus \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that he must understand that renunciation (sanny\u0101sa) andyogaare the same, because without being freed from desire and sense gratification one can become neither ayog\u012bnor asanny\u0101s\u012b.\n\nThere are someyog\u012bswho performyogafor a profit, but that is not realyoga.Everything must be engaged in the service of the Lord. Whatever we do as an ordinary worker or as asanny\u0101s\u012bor as ayog\u012bor as a philosopher must be done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When we are absorbed in the thought of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and when we act in that consciousness, we can become realsanny\u0101s\u012bsand realyog\u012bs.For those who are taking the first step up the staircase of theyogasystem, there is work. One should not think that simply because he is beginningyogahe should stop working. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asks Arjuna to become ayog\u012b,but He never tells him to cease from fighting. Quite the contrary. Of course, one may ask how a person may be ayog\u012band at the same time a warrior. Our conception ofyogapractice is that of sitting very straight, with legs crossed and eyes half-closed, staring at the tip of our nose and concentrating in this way in a lonely place. So how is it that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is asking Arjuna to become ayog\u012band at the same time participate in a ghastly civil war? That is the mystery ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:one can remain a fighting man and at the same time be the highestyog\u012b,the highestsanny\u0101s\u012b.How is this possible? In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One simply has to fight for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eat for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sleep for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and dedicate all activities to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this way one becomes the highestyog\u012band the highestsanny\u0101s\u012b.That is the secret.\n\nIn the Sixth Chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructs Arjuna how to perform meditationalyoga,but Arjuna rejects this as too difficult. How then is Arjuna considered to be a greatyog\u012b? Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saw that Arjuna was rejecting the meditational system, He proclaimed Arjuna to be the highestyog\u012bbecause \u201cYou are always thinking of Me.\u201d Thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the essence of allyogasystems \u2013 of theha\u1e6dha, karma, j\u00f1\u0101na, bhaktior any other system ofyoga,sacrifice or charity. All the recommended activities for spiritual realization end in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in thinking always of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The actual perfection of human life lies in being always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and always being aware of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a while performing all types of activities.\n\nIn the preliminary stage one is advised to always work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must be always searching out some duty or some engagement, for it is a bad policy to remain idle even for a second. When one actually becomes advanced through such engagements, then he may not work physically, but he is always engaged within by constantly thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the preliminary stage, however, one is always advised to engage one\u2019s senses in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are a variety of activities one can perform in serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is intended to help direct aspirant devotees in these activities. For those working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there are simply not enough hours in the day to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are always activities, engagements both day and night, which the student of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness performs joyfully. That is the stage of real happiness \u2013 constant engagement for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness around the world. In the material world one may become very tired if he works all the time, but if one works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day and never get tired. But if we vibrate some mundane vibration, then we soon become exhausted. There is no question of becoming tired on the spiritual platform. The spiritual platform is absolute. In the material world everyone is working for sense gratification. The profits of one\u2019s labor in the material world are used to gratify one\u2019s senses. But a realyog\u012bdoes not desire such fruits. He has no desire other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is already there."

        "chapter_title": "Yoga as Meditation on Krsna",
        "chapter_text": "In Indiathere are sacred places whereyog\u012bsgo to meditate in solitude, as prescribed inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Traditionally,yogacannot be executed in a public place, but insofar ask\u012brtana \u2013 mantra-yoga,or theyogaof chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amantra:Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 is concerned, the more people present, the better. When Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was performingk\u012brtanain India some five hundred years ago, He organized in each group sixteen people to lead the chanting, and thousands of people chanted with them. This participation ink\u012brtana,in the public chanting of the names and glories of God, is very possible and is actually easy in this age; but as far as the meditational process ofyogais concerned, that is very difficult. It is specifically stated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that to perform meditationalyogaone should go to a secluded and holy place. In other words, it is necessary to leave home. In this age of overpopulation it is not always possible to find a secluded place, but this is not necessary inbhakti-yoga.\n\nIn thebhakti-yogasystem there are nine different processes: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity in the temple, praying, carrying out orders, serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a friend and sacrificing for Him. Out of these,\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam,hearing and chanting, are considered the most important. At a publick\u012brtanaone person can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, while a group listens, and at the end of themantra,the group can respond, and in this way there is a reciprocation of hearing and chanting. This can easily be performed in one\u2019s own home, with a small group of friends or with many people in a large public place. One may attempt to practice meditationalyogain a large city or in a society, but one must understand that this is one\u2019s own concoction and is not the method recommended inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nThe whole process of theyogasystem is to purify oneself. And what is this purification? Purification ensues upon the realization of one\u2019s actual identity. Purification is realizing that \u201cI am pure spirit \u2013 I am not this matter.\u201d Due to material contact, we are identifying ourselves with matter, and we are thinking, \u201cI am this body.\u201d But in order to perform realyogaone must realize his constitutional position as being distinct from matter. The purpose of seeking out a secluded place and executing the meditational process is to come to this understanding. It is not possible to come to this understanding if one executes the process improperly. In any case, this is the consideration of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu:\n\nharer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\n\n\u201cIn this age of quarrel and disagreement [Kali-yuga], there is no other way of spiritual realization but this chanting of the names. There is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way.\u201d\n\nIt is generally thought, at least in the Western world, that theyogasystem involves meditating on the void. But the Vedic literatures do not recommend meditating on any void. Rather, theVedasmaintain thatyogameans meditation on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and this is also maintained inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In manyyogasocieties we find that people sit cross-legged and very straight, then close their eyes to meditate, and so fifty percent of them go to sleep, because when we close our eyes and have no subject matter for contemplation, we simply go to sleep. Of course, this is not recommended by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.One must sit very straight, and the eyes be only half-closed, gazing at the tip of one\u2019s nose. If one does not follow the instructions, the result will be sleep and nothing more. Sometimes, of course, meditation goes on when one is sleeping, but this is not the recommended process for the execution ofyoga.Thus, to keep oneself awake K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises that one always keep the tip of the nose visible. In addition, one must be always undisturbed. If the mind is agitated or if there is a great deal of activity going on, one will not be able to concentrate. In meditationalyogaone must also be devoid of fear. There is no question of fear when one enters spiritual life. And one must also bebrahmac\u0101r\u012b,completely free from sex life. Nor can there be any demands on one meditating in this way. When there are no demands, and one executes this system properly, then he can control his mind. After one has met all the requirements for meditation, he must transfer his whole thought to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. It is not that one is to transfer his thought to vacancy. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that one absorbed in the meditationalyogasystem is \u201calways thinking of Me.\u201d\n\nTheyog\u012bobviously has to go through a great deal of difficulty to purify the\u0101tm\u0101(mind, body and soul), but it is a fact that this can be done most effectively in this age simply by the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Why is this? Because this transcendental sound vibration is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When we chant His name with devotion, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with us, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with us, then what is the possibility of remaining impure? Consequently, one absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in chanting the names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and serving Him always, receives the benefit of the highest form ofyoga.The advantage is that he doesn\u2019t have to take all the trouble of the meditational process. That is the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nInyogait is necessary to control all of the senses, and when all the senses are controlled, the mind must be engaged in thinking of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One becomes peaceful after thus conquering material life.\n\njit\u0101tmana\u1e25 pra\u015b\u0101ntasyaparam\u0101tm\u0101 sam\u0101hita\u1e25\n\n\u201cFor one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity.\u201d(Bg. 6.7)This material world has been likened to a great forest fire. As in the forest, fire may automatically take place, so in this material world, although we may try to live peacefully, there is always a great conflagration. It is not possible to live in peace anywhere in the material world. But for one who is transcendentally situated \u2013 either by the medita\u00adtionalyogasystem or by the empirical philosophical method or bybhakti-yoga \u2013peace is possible. All forms ofyogaare meant for transcendental life, but the method of chanting is especially effective in this age.K\u012brtanamay go on for hours, and one may not feel tired, but it is difficult to sit in lotus position perfectly still for more than a few minutes. Yet regardless of the process, once the fire of material life is extinguished, one does not simply experience what is called impersonal void. Rather, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna, one enters into the supreme abode.\n\nyu\u00f1jann eva\u1e41 sad\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41yog\u012b niyata-m\u0101nasa\u1e25\u015b\u0101nti\u1e41 nirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101\u1e41mat-sa\u1e41sth\u0101m adhigacchati\n\n\u201cBy meditating in this manner, always controlling the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God through cessation of material existence.\u201d(Bg. 6.15)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode is not void. It is like an establishment, and in an establishment there is a variety of engagements. The successfulyog\u012bactually attains to the kingdom of God, where there is spiritual variegatedness. Theyogaprocesses are simply ways to elevate oneself to enter into that abode. Actually we belong to that abode, but being forgetful, we are put in this material world. Just as a madman becomes crazy and is put into a lunatic asylum, so we, losing sight of our spiritual identity, become crazy and are put into this material world. Thus the material world is a sort of lunatic asylum, and we can easily notice that nothing is done very sanely here. Our real business is to get out and enter into the kingdom of God. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives information of this kingdom and also gives instructions about His position and our position \u2013 of what He is and what we are. All the information necessary is set forth inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,and a sane man will take advantage of this knowledge."

        "chapter_text": "ThroughoutBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was encouraging Arjuna to fight, for he was a warrior, and fighting was his duty. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a delineates the meditationalyogasystem in the Sixth Chapter, He does not stress it or encourage Arjuna to pursue it as his path. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a admits that this meditational process is very difficult:\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101caasa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101homano durnigraha\u1e41 calamabhy\u0101sena tu kaunteyavair\u0101gye\u1e47a ca g\u1e5bhyate\n\n\u201cThe Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunt\u012b, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by detachment.\u201d(Bg. 6.35)\n\nHere K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a emphasizes practice and renunciation as ways to control the mind. But what is that renunciation? Today it is hardly possible for us to renounce anything, for we are so habituated to such a variety of material sense pleasures. Despite leading a life of uncontrolled sense indulgence, we attendyogaclasses and expect to attain success. There are so many rules and regulations involved in the proper execution ofyoga,and most of us can hardly give up a simple habit like smoking.\n\nIn His discourse on the meditationalyogasystem, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims thatyogacannot be properly performed by one who eats too much or eats too little. One who starves himself cannot properly performyoga.Nor can the person who eats more than required. The eating process should be moderate, just enough to keep body and soul together; it should not be for the enjoyment of the tongue. When palatable dishes come before us, we are accustomed to take not just one of the preparations but two, three and four \u2013 and upwards. Our tongue is never satisfied. But it is not unusual in India to see ayog\u012btake only a small spoonful of rice a day and nothing more. Nor can one execute the meditationalyogasystem if one sleeps too much or does not sleep sufficiently. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not say that there is such a thing as dreamless sleep. As soon as we go to sleep, we will have a dream, although we may not remember it. In theG\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cautions that one who dreams too much while sleeping cannot properly executeyoga.One should not sleep more than six hours daily. Nor can one infected by insomnia, who cannot sleep at night, successfully executeyoga,for the body must be kept fit. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a outlines so many requirements for disciplining the body. All these requirements, however, can essentially be broken down into four basic rules: no illicit sexual connection, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. These are the four minimum regulations for the execution of anyyogasystem. And in this age who can refrain from these activities? We have to test ourselves accordingly to ascertain our success inyogaexecution.\n\nyog\u012b yu\u00f1j\u012bta satatam\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 rahasi sthita\u1e25ek\u0101k\u012b yata-citt\u0101tm\u0101nir\u0101\u015b\u012br aparigraha\u1e25\n\n\u201cA transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.\u201d(Bg. 6.10)From this verse we can understand that it is the duty of theyog\u012bto always remain alone. Meditationalyogacannot be performed in an assembly, at least not according toBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In the meditational system it is not possible to concentrate the mind upon the Supersoul except in a secluded place. In India, there are still manyyog\u012bswho assemble at the Kumba Mel\u0101. Generally they are in seclusion, but on rare occasions they come to attend special functions. In India there are still thousands ofyog\u012bsand sages, and every twelve years or so they meet in particular holy places \u2013 Allahabad, etc. \u2013 just as in America they have businessmen\u2019s conventions.Theyog\u012b,in addition to living in a secluded place, should also be free from desires and should not think that he is performingyogato achieve some material powers. Nor should he accept gifts or favors from people. If he is properly executing this meditationalyoga,he stays alone in the jungles, forests or mountains and avoids society altogether. At all times he must be convinced for whom he has become ayog\u012b.He does not consider himself alone because at all times the Param\u00ad\u0101tm\u0101 \u2013 Supersoul \u2013 is with him. From this we can see that in modern civilization it is indeed very difficult to execute this meditational form ofyogaproperly. Contemporary civilization in this age of Kali has actually made it impossible for us to be alone, to be desireless and to be possessionless.\n\nThe method of executing meditationalyogais further explained in considerable detail by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\n\u015bucau de\u015be prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101pyasthiram \u0101sanam \u0101tmana\u1e25n\u0101ty-ucchrita\u1e41 n\u0101ti-n\u012bca\u1e41cail\u0101jina-ku\u015bottaram\n\ntatraik\u0101gra\u1e41 mana\u1e25 k\u1e5btv\u0101yata-cittendriya-kriya\u1e25upavi\u015by\u0101sane yu\u00f1jy\u0101dyogam \u0101tma-vi\u015buddhaye\n\n\u201cTo practiceyoga,one should go to a secluded place and should layku\u015bagrass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. Theyog\u012bshould then sit on it very firmly and should practiceyogaby controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.\u201d (Bg. 6.11\u201312) Generallyyog\u012bssit on tiger skin or deerskin because reptiles will not crawl on such skins to disturb their meditations. It seems that in God\u2019s creation there is a use for everything. Every grass and herb has its use and serves some function, although we may not know what it is. So inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has made some provision whereby theyog\u012bdoesn\u2019t have to worry about snakes. Having acquired a good sitting place in a secluded environment, theyog\u012bbegins to purify the\u0101tm\u0101 \u2013body, mind and soul. Theyog\u012bshould not think, \u201cNow I will try to achieve some wonderful powers.\u201d Sometimesyog\u012bsdo attain certainsiddhis,or powers, but these are not the purpose ofyoga,and realyog\u012bsdo not exhibit them. The realyog\u012bthinks, \u201cI am now contaminated by this material atmosphere, so now I must purify myself.\u201d\n\nWe can quickly see that controlling the mind and body is not such an easy thing and that we cannot control them as easily as we can go to the store and purchase something. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that these rules can be easily followed when we are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nOf course everyone is motivated by sex life, but sex life is not actually discouraged. We have this material body, and as long as we have it, sex desire will be there. Similarly, as long as we have the body, we must eat to maintain it, and we must sleep in order to give it rest. We cannot expect to negate these activities, but the Vedic literatures do give us guidelines for regulation in eating, sleeping, mating, etc. If we at all expect success in theyogasystem, we cannot allow our unbridled senses to take us down the paths of sense objects; therefore guidelines are set up. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is advising that the mind can be controlled through regulation. If we do not regulate our activities, our mind will be more and more agitated. It is not that activities are to be stopped, but regulated by the mind always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Being always engaged in some activity connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actualsam\u0101dhi.It is not that when one is insam\u0101dhihe doesn\u2019t eat, work, sleep or enjoy himself in any way. Rather,sam\u0101dhican be defined as executing regulated activities while absorbed in the thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nasa\u1e41yat\u0101tman\u0101 yogodu\u1e63pr\u0101pa iti me mati\u1e25va\u015by\u0101tman\u0101 tu yatat\u0101\u015bakyo \u2019v\u0101ptum up\u0101yata\u1e25\n\n\u201cFor one whose mind is unbridled,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further says, \u201cself-realization is difficult work.\u201d(Bg. 6.36)Anyone knows that an unbridled horse is dangerous to ride. He can go in any direction at any speed, and his rider is likely to come to some harm. Insofar as the mind is unbridled, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a agrees with Arjuna that theyogasystem is very difficult work indeed. \u201cBut,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a adds, \u201che whose mind is controlled and strives by right means is assured of success. That is My judgment.\u201d(Bg. 6.36)What is meant by \u201cstrives by right means\u201d? One has to try to follow the four basic regulative principles as mentioned and execute his activities absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIf one wants to engage inyogaat home, then he has to make certain that his other engagements are moderate. He cannot spend long hours of the day working hard to simply earn a livelihood. One should work very moderately, eat very moderately, gratify the senses very moderately and keep his life as free from anxiety as possible. In this way practice ofyogamay be successful.\n\nWhat is the sign by which we can tell that one has attained perfection inyoga? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that one is situated inyogawhen his consciousness is completely under his control.\n\nyad\u0101 viniyata\u1e41 cittam\u0101tmany ev\u0101vati\u1e63\u1e6dhatenisp\u1e5bha\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mebhyoyukta ity ucyate tad\u0101\n\n\u201cWhen theyog\u012b,by practice ofyoga,disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in Transcendence \u2013 devoid of all material desires \u2013 he is said to have attainedyoga.\u201d(Bg. 6.18)One who has attainedyogais not dependent on the dictations of his mind; rather, the mind comes under his control. Nor is the mind put out or extinguished, for it is the business of theyog\u012bto think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, always. Theyog\u012bcannot allow his mind to go out. This may sound very difficult, but it is possible in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When one is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then how is it possible for the mind to wander away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? In the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the mind is automatically controlled.\n\nNor should theyog\u012bhave any desire for material sense gratification. If one is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he has no desire other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not possible to become desire\u00adless. The desire for sense gratification must be overcome by the process of purification, but desire for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be cultivated. It is simply that we have to transfer the desire. There is no question of killing desire, for desire is the constant companion of the living entity. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process by which one purifies his desires; instead of desiring so many things for sense gratification, one simply desires things for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, we may desire palatable food, but instead of preparing foodstuffs for ourselves, we can prepare them for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and offer them to Him. It is not that the action is different, but there is a transfer of consciousness from thinking of acting for my senses to thinking of acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We may prepare nice milk products, vegetables, grains, fruits and other vegetarian dishes for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then offer them to Him, praying, \u201cThis material body is a lump of ignorance and the senses are a network of paths leading to death. Of all the senses the tongue is the most voracious and difficult to control. It is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world; therefore \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given us this nicepras\u0101da,spiritual food, to conquer the tongue. So let us take thispras\u0101dato our full satisfaction and glorify Their Lordships \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and in love call for the help of Lord Caitanya and Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu.\u201d In this way ourkarmais sacrificed, for from the very beginning we are thinking that the food is being offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We should have no personal desires for the food. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so merciful, however, that he gives us the food to eat. In this way our desire is fulfilled. When one has moulded his life in such a way \u2013 dovetailing his desires to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s \u2013 then it is to be understood that he has attained perfection inyoga.Simply breathing deeply and doing some exercises is notyogaas far asBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is concerned. A whole purification of consciousness is required.\n\nIn the execution ofyoga,it is very important that the mind is not agitated.\n\nyath\u0101 d\u012bpo niv\u0101ta-sthone\u1e45gate sopam\u0101 sm\u1e5bt\u0101yogino yata-cittasyayu\u00f1jato yogam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\u201cAs a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent self.\u201d(Bg. 6.19)When a candle is in a windless place, its flame remains straight and does not waver. The mind, like the flame, is susceptible to so many material desires that with the slightest agitation it will move. A little movement of the mind can change the whole consciousness. Therefore in India one seriously practicingyogatraditionally remainedbrahmac\u0101r\u012b,or celibate.\n\nThere are two kinds ofbrahmac\u0101r\u012b:one is completely celibate and the other isg\u1e5bhastha-brahmac\u0101r\u012b,that is to say he has a wife, he does not associate with any other woman, and his relations with his own wife are strictly regulated. In this way, either by complete celibacy or restricted sex life, one\u2019s mind is kept from being agitated. Yet when one takes a vow to remain a complete celibate, his mind may still be agitated by sexual desire; therefore in India those practicing the traditionalyogaunder strict vows of celibacy are not allowed to sit alone even with a mother, sister or daughter. The mind is so fickle that the slightest suggestion can create havoc.\n\nTheyog\u012bshould have his mind trained in such a way that as soon as his mind wanders from meditation on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he drags it back again. This requires a great deal of practice. One must come to know that his real happiness is in experiencing the pleasure of his transcendental senses, not the material senses. Senses are not to be sacrificed, and desires are not to be sacrificed, but there are both desires and sense satisfaction in the spiritual sphere. Real happiness is transcendental to material, sensual experience. If one is not convinced of this, he will surely be agitated and will fall down. One should therefore know that the happiness he is trying to derive from material senses is not really happiness.\n\nThose who are actuallyyog\u012bstruly enjoy, but how do they enjoy?Ramante yogino \u2019nante \u2013their enjoyment is unlimited, that unlimited enjoyment is real happiness, and such happiness is spiritual, not material. This is the real meaning ofR\u0101ma,as in the chant Hare R\u0101ma.R\u0101mameans enjoyment through spiritual life. Spiritual life is all pleasure, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all pleasure. We do not have to sacrifice pleasure, but we do have to enjoy it properly. A diseased man cannot enjoy life; his enjoyment of life is a false enjoyment. But when he is cured and is healthy, then he is able to enjoy. Similarly, as long as we are in the material conception of life, we are not actually enjoying ourselves but are simply becoming more and more entangled in material nature. If a sick man is not supposed to eat, his eating unrestrictedly actually kills him. Similarly, the more we increase material enjoyment, the more we become entangled in this world, and the more difficult it becomes to get free from the material entrapment. All of the systems ofyogaare meant to disentangle the conditioned soul from this entrapment, to transfer him from the false enjoyment of material things to the actual enjoyment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\nyatroparamate citta\u1e41niruddha\u1e41 yoga-sevay\u0101yatra caiv\u0101tman\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41pa\u015byann \u0101tmani tu\u1e63yati\n\nsukham \u0101tyantika\u1e41 yat tadbuddhi-gr\u0101hyam at\u012bndriyamvetti yatra na caiv\u0101ya\u1e41sthita\u015b calati tattvata\u1e25\n\nya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25yasmin sthito na du\u1e25khenaguru\u1e47\u0101pi vic\u0101lyate\n\nta\u1e41 vidy\u0101d du\u1e25kha-sa\u1e41yoga-viyoga\u1e41 yoga-sa\u1e41j\u00f1itam\n\n\u201cIn the stage of perfection called trance, orsam\u0101dhi,one\u2019s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice ofyoga.This is characterized by one\u2019s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.\u201d (Bg. 6.20\u201323)\n\nOne form ofyogamay be difficult and another may be easy, but in all cases one must purify his existence to the conception of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious enjoyment. Then one will be happy.\n\nyad\u0101 hi nendriy\u0101rthe\u1e63una karmasv anu\u1e63ajjatesarva-sa\u1e45kalpa-sanny\u0101s\u012byog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dhas tadocyate\n\nuddhared \u0101tman\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41n\u0101tm\u0101nam avas\u0101dayet\u0101tmaiva hy \u0101tmano bandhur\u0101tmaiva ripur \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\u201cA person is said to have attained toyogawhen, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities. A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.\u201d(Bg. 6.4\u20135) We have to raise ourselves to the spiritual standard by ourselves. In this sense I am my own friend and I am my own enemy. The opportunity is ours. There is a very nice verse by C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita: \u201cNo one is anyone\u2019s friend, no one is anyone\u2019s enemy. It is only by behavior that one can understand who is his friend and who is his enemy.\u201d No one is born our enemy, and no one is born our friend. These roles are determined by mutual behavior. As we have dealings with others in ordinary affairs, in the same way the individual has dealings with himself. I may act as my own friend or as an enemy. As a friend, I can understand my position as spirit soul and, seeing that somehow or other I have come into contact with material nature, try to get free from material entanglement by acting in such a way as to disentangle myself. In this case I am my friend. But if even after getting this opportunity I do not take it, then I should be considered my own worst enemy.\n\nbandhur \u0101tm\u0101tmanas tasyayen\u0101tmaiv\u0101tman\u0101 jita\u1e25an\u0101tmanas tu \u015batrutvevartet\u0101tmaiva \u015batru-vat\n\n\u201cFor he who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy.\u201d(Bg. 6.6)How is it possible for one to become his own friend? This is explained here.\u0100tm\u0101means \u201cmind,\u201d \u201cbody\u201d and \u201csoul.\u201d When we speak of\u0101tm\u0101,insofar as we are in the bodily conception, we refer to the body. However, when we transcend the bodily conception and rise to the mental platform,\u0101tm\u0101refers to the mind. But actually when we are situated on the truly spiritual platform, then\u0101tm\u0101refers to the soul. In actuality we are pure spirit. In this way, according to one\u2019s spiritual development, the meaning of the word\u0101tm\u0101differs. As far as theNiruktiVedic dictionary is concerned,\u0101tm\u0101refers to body, mind and soul. However, in this verse ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u0101tm\u0101refers to mind.\n\nIf, throughyoga,the mind can be trained, then the mind is our friend. But if the mind is left untrained, then there is no possibility of leading a successful life. For one who has no idea of spiritual life, the mind is the enemy. If one thinks that he is simply the body, his mind will not be working for his benefit; it will simply be acting to serve the gross body and to further condition the living entity and entrap him in material nature. If, however, one understands one\u2019s position as spirit soul apart from the body, the mind can be a liberating factor. In itself, the mind has nothing to do; it is simply waiting to be trained, and it is best trained through association. Desire is the function of the mind, and one desires according to his association; so if the mind is to act as friend, there must be good association.\n\nThe best association is as\u0101dhu,that is, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person or one who is striving for spiritual realization.There are those who are striving for temporary things(asat). Matter and the body are temporary, and if one only engages himself for bodily pleasure, he is conditioned by temporary things. But if he engages himself in self-realization, then he is engaged in something permanent (sat). Obviously if one is intelligent he will associate with those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of self-realization through one of the various forms ofyoga.The result will be that those who ares\u0101dhu,or realized, will be able to sever his attachment to material association. This is the great advantage of good association. For instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaksBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101to Arjuna just to cut off his attachment to this material affection. Because Arjuna is attracted to things that are impeding the execution of his own duty, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a severs these things. To cut something, a sharp instrument is required; and to cut the mind from its attachments, sharp words are often required. Thes\u0101dhuor teacher shows no mercy in using sharp words to sever the student\u2019s mind from material attractions. By speaking the truth uncompromisingly, he is able to sever the bondage. For example, at the very beginning ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks sharply to Arjuna by telling him that although he speaks like a learned man, he is actually fool number one. If we actually want detachment from this material world, we should be prepared to accept such cutting words from the spiritual master. Compromise and flattery have no effect where strong words are required.\n\nInBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101the material conception of life is condemned in so many places. One who thinks the country in which he is born is worshipable, or one who goes to holy places and yet ignores thes\u0101dhusthere, is likened unto an ass. As an enemy is always thinking of doing harm, so the untrained mind will drag one deeper and deeper into material entanglement. Conditioned souls struggle very hard with the mind and with the other senses. Since the mind directs the other senses, it is of utmost importance to make the mind the friend.\n\njit\u0101tmana\u1e25 pra\u015b\u0101ntasyaparam\u0101tm\u0101 sam\u0101hita\u1e25\u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25khe\u1e63utath\u0101 m\u0101n\u0101pam\u0101nayo\u1e25\n\n\u201cFor one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.\u201d(Bg. 6.7)By training the mind, one actually attains tranquillity, for the mind is always dragging us over nonpermanent things, just as an unbridled horse will pull a chariot on a perilous course. Although we are permanent and eternal, somehow or other we have become attracted to nonpermanent things. But the mind can be easily trained if it is simply fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as a fort is safe when it is defended by a great general, if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is placed in the fort of the mind, there will be no possibility of the enemy\u2019s entering. Material education, wealth and power will not help one to control the mind. A great devotee prays, \u201cWhen will I be able to think of You constantly? My mind is always dragging me about, but as soon as I am able to fix my mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it becomes clear.\u201d When the mind is clear, it is possible to meditate on the Supersoul. The Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, is always seated within the heart along with the individual soul. Theyogasystem involves concentrating the mind and focusing it on the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, seated within the heart. The previously quoted verse fromBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101indicates that one who has conquered the mind and has overcome all attachment to nonpermanent things can be absorbed in thought of the Param\u0101tm\u0101. One so absorbed becomes free from all duality and false designations."

        "chapter_title": "Yoga as Freedom from Duality and Designation",
        "chapter_text": "This material worldis a world of duality \u2013 at one moment we are subjected to the heat of the summer season and at the next moment the cold of winter. Or at one moment we\u2019re happy and at the next moment distressed. At one moment honored, at the next dishonored. In the ma\u00adterial world of duality, it is impossible to understand one thing without understanding its opposite. It is not possible to understand what honor is unless I understand dishonor. Similarly, I cannot understand what misery is if I have never tasted happiness. Nor can I understand what happiness is unless I have tasted misery. One has to transcend such dualities, but as long as this body is here these dualities will be here also. Insofar as one strives to get out of bodily conceptions \u2013 not out of the body but out of bodily conceptions \u2013 one has to learn to tolerate such dualities. In the Second Chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informs Arjuna that the duality of distress and happiness is due to the body alone. It\u2019s like a skin disease, or skin itch. Just because there is itching, one should not be mad after it to scratch it. We should not go mad or give up our duty just because mosquitoes bite us. There are so many dualities one has to tolerate, but if the mind is fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all these dualities will seem insignificant.\n\nHow is it one can tolerate such dualities?\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-vij\u00f1\u0101na-t\u1e5bpt\u0101tm\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da-stho vijitendriya\u1e25yukta ity ucyate yog\u012bsama-lo\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u015bma-k\u0101\u00f1cana\u1e25\n\n\u201cA person is said to be established in self-realization and is called ayog\u012b(or mystic) when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. He sees everything \u2013 whether it be pebbles, stones or gold \u2013 as the same.\u201d(Bg. 6.8)J\u00f1\u0101nameans theoretical knowledge, andvij\u00f1\u0101narefers to practical knowledge. For instance, a science student has to study theoretical scientific conceptions as well as applied science. Theoretical knowledge alone will not help. One has to be able to also apply this knowledge. Similarly, inyogaone should have not only theo\u00adretical knowledge but practical knowledge. Simply understanding \u201cI am not this body\u201d and at the same time acting in a nonsensical way will not help. There are so many societies where the members seriously discuss Ved\u0101nta philosophy while smoking and drinking and enjoying a sensual life. It will not help if one only has knowledge theoretically. This knowledge must be demonstrated. One who truly understands \u201cI am not this body\u201d will actually reduce his bodily necessities to a minimum. When one increases the demands of the body while thinking \u201cI am not this body,\u201d then of what use is that knowledge? A person can only be satisfied when there isj\u00f1\u0101naandvij\u00f1\u0101naside by side.\n\nWhen a person is situated on the practical level of spiritual realization, it should be understood he is actually situated inyoga.It is not that one should continue to attendyogaclasses and yet remain the same throughout his life; there must be practical realization. And what is the sign of that practical realization? The mind will be calm and quiet and no longer agitated by the attraction of the material world. Thus self-controlled, one is not attracted by the material glitter, and he sees everything \u2013 pebbles, stones or gold \u2013 as the same. In the material civilization, so much paraphernalia is produced just to satisfy the senses. These things are produced under the banner of material advancement. He who is situated inyogasees such paraphernalia as just so much rubbish in the street. Moreover,\n\nsuh\u1e5bn-mitr\u0101ry-ud\u0101s\u012bna-madhyastha-dve\u1e63ya-bandhu\u1e63us\u0101dhu\u1e63v api ca p\u0101pe\u1e63usama-buddhir vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\n\n\u201cA person is said to be still further advanced when he regards all \u2013 the honest well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those who are indifferent and impartial \u2013 with an equal mind.\u201d(Bg. 6.9)There are different kinds of friends. There issuh\u1e5bt,who is by nature a well-wisher and is always desiring one\u2019s welfare.Mitrarefers to an ordinary friend, andud\u0101s\u012bnais one who is neutral. In this material world someone may be my well-wisher, friend or neither friend nor enemy but neutral. Someone else may serve as a mediator between me and my enemies, and in this verse he is calledmadhya-stha.One may also see someone as pious and another as sinful according to his own calculations. But when he is situated in transcendence, all of these \u2013 friends, enemies or whatever \u2013 cease to exist. When one becomes actually learned, he does not see any enemy or any friend because in actuality \u201cno one is my enemy, no one is my friend, no one is my father, no one is my mother, etc.\u201d We are all simply living entities playing on a stage in the dress of father, mother, children, friend, enemy, sinner and saint, etc. It is like a great drama with so many characters playing their parts. However, on the stage a person may be an enemy or whatever, but off the stage all the actors are friends. Similarly, with these bodies we are playing on the stage of material nature, and we attach so many designations to one another. I may be thinking, \u201cThis is my son,\u201d but in actuality I cannot beget any son. It is not possible. At the utmost I can only beget a body. It is not within any man\u2019s power to beget a living entity. Merely by sexual intercourse a living entity cannot be begotten. The living entity must beplacedin the emulsification of secretions. This is the verdict of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Thus all the multifarious relationships between bodies are just so much stage play. One who is actually realized and has actually attainedyogano longer sees these bodily distinctions."

        "chapter_title": "The Fate of the Unsuccessful Yog\u012b",
        "chapter_text": "It is notthatBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101rejects the meditationalyogaprocess; it recognizes it as a bona fide method, but it further indicates that it is not possible in this age. Thus the subject in the Sixth Chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is quickly dropped by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna. Arjuna next asks,\n\nayati\u1e25 \u015braddhayopetoyog\u0101c calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25apr\u0101pya yoga-sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41k\u0101\u1e41 gati\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gacchati\n\n\u201cWhat is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?\u201d (Bg.6.37) In other words, he is asking what becomes of the unsuccessfulyog\u012b,or the person who attempts to performyogabut somehow desists and does not succeed. It is something like a student who does not get his degree because he drops out of school. Elsewhere in theG\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out to Arjuna that out of many men, few strive for perfection, and out of those who strive for perfection, only a few succeed. So Arjuna is inquiring after the vast number of failures. Even if a man has faith and strives for perfection in theyogasystem, Arjuna points out that he may not attain this perfection due to \u201cworldly-mindedness.\u201d\n\nkaccin nobhaya-vibhra\u1e63\u1e6da\u015bchinn\u0101bhram iva na\u015byatiaprati\u1e63\u1e6dho mah\u0101-b\u0101hovim\u016b\u1e0dho brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 pathi\n\n\u201cO mighty-armed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d Arjuna continues, \u201cdoes not such a man, being deviated from the path of Transcendence, perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?\u201d(Bg. 6.38)When a cloud is torn apart by the wind, it does not mend back together again.\n\netan me sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47achettum arhasy a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25tvad-anya\u1e25 sa\u1e41\u015bayasy\u0101syachett\u0101 na hy upapadyate\n\n\u201cThis is my doubt, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.\u201d(Bg. 6.39)Arjuna is asking this question about the fate of the unsuccessfulyog\u012bso that in the future people would not be discouraged. By ayog\u012b,Arjuna is referring to theha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bandbhakti-yog\u012b;it is not that meditation is the only form ofyoga.The meditator, the philosopher and the devotee are all to be consideredyog\u012bs.Arjuna is questioning for all those who are attempting to become successful transcendentalists. And how does \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a answer him?\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101cap\u0101rtha naiveha n\u0101mutravin\u0101\u015bas tasya vidyatena hi kaly\u0101\u1e47a-k\u1e5bt ka\u015bciddurgati\u1e41 t\u0101ta gacchati\n\nHere, as in many other places throughout theG\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as Bhagav\u0101n. This is another of the Lord\u2019s innumerable names.Bhagav\u0101nindicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of six opulences: He possesses all beauty, all wealth, all power, all fame, all knowledge and all renunciation. Living entities partake of these opulences in finite degrees. One may be famous in a family, in a town, in a country or on one planet, but no one is famous throughout the creation, as is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The leaders of the world may be famous for a few years only, but Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared five thousand years ago and is still being worshiped. So one who possesses all six of these opulences in completeness is considered to be God. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks to Arjuna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such it is to be understood that He has complete knowledge.Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was imparted to the sun-god and to Arjuna by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but nowhere is it mentioned thatBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101was imparted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Why? Complete knowledge means that He knows everything that is to be known. This is an attribute of God alone. Being that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows everything, Arjuna is putting this question to Him about the fate of the unsuccessfulyog\u012b.There is no possibility for Arjuna to research the truth. He simply has to receive the truth from the complete source, and this is the system of disciplic succession. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete, and the knowledge that comes from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also complete. If Arjuna receives this complete knowledge and we receive it from Arjuna as it was spoken to him, then we also receive complete knowledge. And what is this knowledge? \u201cThe Blessed Lord said: Son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.\u201d(Bg. 6.40)Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that the very striving foryogaperfection is a most auspicious attempt. When one attempts something so auspicious, he is never degraded.\n\nActually Arjuna is asking a very appropriate and intelligent question. It is not unusual for one to fall down from the platform of devotional service. Sometimes a neophyte devotee does not keep the rules and regulations. Sometimes he yields to intoxication or is trapped by some feminine attractions. These are impediments on the path ofyogaperfection. But \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives an encouraging answer, for He tells Arjuna that even if one sincerely cultivates only one-percent worth of spiritual knowledge, he will never fall down into the material whirlpool. That is due to the sincerity of his effort. It should always be understood that we are weak and that the material energy is very strong. To adopt spiritual life is more or less to declare war against the material energy. The material energy is trying to entrap the conditioned soul as much as possible, and when the conditioned soul tries to get out of her clutches by spiritual advancement of knowledge, material nature becomes more stringent and vigorous in her efforts to test how much the aspiring spiritualist is sincere. The material energy, orm\u0101y\u0101,will then offer more allurements.\n\nIn this regard, there is the story of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni, a great king, ak\u1e63atriya,who renounced his kingdom and took to theyogaprocess in order to become more spiritually advanced. At that time the meditationalyogaprocess was possible to execute. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni meditated so intently that Indra, the King of heaven, noticed him and thought, \u201cThis man is trying to occupy my post.\u201d The heavenly planets are also material, and there is competition \u2013 no businessman wants another businessman to exceed him. Fearing that Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni would actually depose him, Indra sent one heavenly society girl, named Menak\u0101, to allure him sexually. Menak\u0101 was naturally very beautiful, and she was intent on disrupting themuni\u2019smeditations. Indeed, he became aware of her feminine presence upon hearing the sound of her bangles, and he immediately looked up from his meditation, saw her, and became captivated by her beauty. As a result, the beautiful girl \u015aakuntal\u0101 was born by their conjugation. When \u015aakuntal\u0101 was born, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra lamented: \u201cOh, I was just trying to cultivate spiritual knowledge, and again I have been entrapped.\u201d He was about to flee when Menak\u0101 brought his beautiful daughter before him and chastised him. Despite her pleading, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra resolved to leave anyway.\n\nThus there is every chance of failure on the yogic path; even a great sage like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni can fall down due to material allurement. Although themunifell for the time being, he again resolved to go on with theyogaprocess, and this should be our resolve. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informs us that such failures should not be cause for despair. There is the famous proverb that \u201cFailure is the pillar of success.\u201d In the spiritual life especially, failure is not discouraging. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very clearly states that even if there is failure, there is no loss either in this world or in the next. One who takes to this auspicious line of spiritual culture is never completely vanquished.\n\nNow what actually happens to the unsuccessful spiritualist? \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically explains,\n\npr\u0101pya pu\u1e47ya-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e41 lok\u0101nu\u1e63itv\u0101 \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b\u1e25 sam\u0101\u1e25\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 geheyoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do \u2019bhij\u0101yate\n\nathav\u0101 yogin\u0101m evakule bhavati dh\u012bmat\u0101metad dhi durlabhatara\u1e41loke janma yad \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam\n\n\u201cThe unsuccessfulyog\u012b,after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy. Or he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Verily, such a birth is rare in this world.\u201d(Bg. 6.41\u201342) There are many planets in the universe, and on the higher planets there are greater comforts, the duration of life is longer, and the inhabitants are more religious and godly. Since it is said that six months on earth is equal to one day on the higher planets, the unsuccessfulyog\u012bstays on these higher planets for many, many years. Vedic literatures describe their lifetimes as lasting ten thousand years. So even if one is a failure, he is promoted to these higher planets. But one cannot remain there perpetually. When the fruits or the results of one\u2019s pious activities expire, he has to return to earth. Yet even upon returning to this planet, the unsuccessfulyog\u012bmeets with fortunate circumstances, for he takes his birth in either a very rich family or a pious one.\n\nGenerally, according to the law ofkarma,if one enacts pious deeds, he is rewarded in the next life by birth into a very aristocratic family or into a very wealthy family, or he becomes a great scholar, or he is born very beautiful. In any case, those who sincerely begin spiritual life are guaranteed human birth in the next life \u2013 not only human birth, but birth into either a very pious or a very wealthy family. Thus one with such a good birth should understand that his fortune is due to his previous pious activities and to God\u2019s grace. These facilities are given by the Lord, who is always willing to give us the means to attain Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply wants to see that we are sincere. In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated that every particular person has his own duty in life, regardless of his position and regardless of his society. If, however, he gives up his prescribed duty and somehow \u2013 either out of sentiment or association or craziness or whatever \u2013 takes shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if, due to his immaturity, he falls from the devotional path, still there is no loss for him. On the other hand, if a person executes his duties perfectly but does not approach God, then what does he earn? His life is indeed without benefit. But a person who has approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is better situated, even though he may fall down from the yogic platform.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further indicates that of all good families to be born into \u2013 families of successful merchants or philosophers or meditators \u2013 the best is the family ofyog\u012bs.One who takes birth in a very rich family may be misled. It is normal for a man who is given great riches to try to enjoy those riches; thus rich men\u2019s sons often become drunkards or prostitute hunters. Similarly, one who takes birth in a pious family or in a brahminical family often becomes very puffed up and proud, thinking, \u201cI am abr\u0101hma\u1e47a;I am a pious man.\u201d There is chance of degradation in both rich and pious families, but one who takes birth in a family ofyog\u012bsor of devotees has a much better chance of cultivating again that spiritual life from which he has fallen. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna,\n\ntatra ta\u1e41 buddhi-sa\u1e41yoga\u1e41labhate paurva-dehikamyatate ca tato bh\u016bya\u1e25sa\u1e41siddhau kuru-nandana\n\n\u201cOn taking such a birth, he again revives the divine consciousness of his previous life, and he tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success, O son of Kuru.\u201d(Bg. 6.43)\n\nBeing born in a family of those who executeyogaor devotional service, one remembers his spiritual activities executed in his previous life. Anyone who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness seriously is not an ordinary person; he must have taken to the same process in his previous life. Why is this?\n\np\u016brv\u0101bhy\u0101sena tenaivahriyate hy ava\u015bo \u2019pi sa\u1e25\n\n\u201cBy virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles \u2013 even without seeking them.\u201d(Bg. 6.44)In the material world, we have experience that we do not carry our assets from one life to another. I may have millions of dollars in the bank, but as soon as my body is finished, my bank balance is also. At death, the bank balance does not go with me; it remains in the bank to be enjoyed by somebody else. This is not the case with spiritual culture. Even if one enacts a very small amount on the spiritual platform, he takes that with him to his next life, and he picks up again from that point.\n\nWhen one picks up this knowledge that was interrupted, he should know that he should now finish the balance and complete the yogic process. One should not take the chance of finishing up the process in another birth but should resolve to finish it in this life. We should be determined in this way: \u201cSomehow or other in my last life, I did not finish my spiritual cultivation. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given me another opportunity, so let me finish it up in this life.\u201d Thus after leaving this body one will not again take birth in this material world, where birth, old age, disease and death are omnipresent, but will return to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sees this material world simply as a place of danger. For one who takes to spiritual culture, this material world is actually unfit. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b used to say, \u201cThis place is not fit for a gentleman.\u201d Once one has approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and has attempted to make spiritual progress, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is situated within the heart, begins to give directions. In theG\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that for one who wants to remember Him, He gives remembrance, and for one who wants to forget Him, He allows him to forget."

        "chapter_text": "We have heardmany times of theyogasystem. Theyogasystem is approved byBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,but theyogasystem inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is especially meant for purification. The aim is threefold: to control the senses, to purify activities and to link oneself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a reciprocal relationship.\n\nThe Absolute Truth is realized in three stages: impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 (Supersoul) and ultimately Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the final analysis, the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. Simultaneously He is the all-pervading Supersoul within the hearts of all living entities and within the core of all atoms, and He is thebrahmajyoti,or the effulgence of spiritual light, as well. Bhagav\u0101n \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time He is full of all renunciation. In the material world we find that one who has much opulence is not very much inclined to give it up, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like this. He can renounce everything and remain complete in Himself.\n\nWhen we read or studyBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101under a bona fide spiritual master we should not think that the spiritual master is presenting his own opinions. It is not he who is speaking. He is just an instrument. The real speaker is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is both within and without. At the beginning of His discourse on theyogasystem in the Sixth Chapter ofBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\nan\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phala\u1e41k\u0101rya\u1e41 karma karoti ya\u1e25sa sanny\u0101s\u012b ca yog\u012b cana niragnir na c\u0101kriya\u1e25\n\n\u201cOne who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.\u201d(Bg. 6.1)Everyone is working and expecting some result. One may ask, What is the purpose of working if no result is expected? A remuneration or salary is always demanded by the worker. But here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that one can work out of a sense of duty alone, not expecting the results of his activities. If one works in this way, then he is actually asanny\u0101s\u012b;he is in the renounced order of life.\n\nAccording to Vedic culture, there are four stages of life:brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprasthaandsanny\u0101sa. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bis student life devoted to training in spiritual understanding.G\u1e5bhasthalife is married householder life. Then upon reaching the approximate age of fifty, one may take thev\u0101naprasthaorder \u2013 that is, he leaves his home and children and travels with his wife to holy places of pilgrimage. Finally he gives up both wife and children and remains alone to cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that stage is calledsanny\u0101sa,or the renounced order of life. Yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates that for asanny\u0101s\u012b,renunciation is not all. In addition, there must be some duty. What then is the duty for asanny\u0101s\u012b,for one who has renounced family life and no longer has ma\u00adterial obligations? His duty is a most responsible one; it is to work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Moreover, this is the real duty for everyone in all stages of life.\n\nIn everyone\u2019s life there are two duties: one is to serve the illusion, and the other is to serve the reality. When one serves the reality, he is a realsanny\u0101s\u012b.And when one serves the illusion, he is deluded bym\u0101y\u0101.One has to understand, however, that he is in all circumstances forced to serve. Either he serves the illusion or the reality. The constitutional position of the living entity is to be a servant, not a master. One may think that he is the master, but he is actually a servant. When one has a family he may think that he is the master of his wife, or his children, or his home, business and so on, but that is all false. One is actually the servant of his wife, of his children and of his business. The president may be considered the master of the country, but actually he is the servant of the country. Our position is always as servant \u2013 either as servant of the illusion or as servant of God. If, however, we remain the servant of the illusion, then our life is wasted. Of course everyone is thinking that he is not a servant, that he is working only for himself. Although the fruits of his labor are transient and illusory, they force him to become a servant of illusion, or a servant of his own senses. But when one awakens to his transcendental senses and actually becomes situated in knowledge, he then becomes a servant of the reality. When one comes to the platform of knowledge, he understands that in all circumstances he is a servant. Since it is not possible for him to be master, he is much better situated serving the reality instead of the illusion. When one becomes aware of this, he attains the platform of real knowledge. Bysanny\u0101sa,the renounced order of life, we refer to one who has come to this platform.Sanny\u0101sais a question of realization, not social status.\n\nIt is the duty of everyone to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and to serve the cause of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When one actually realizes this he becomes amah\u0101tm\u0101,or a great soul. InBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that after many births, when one comes to the platform of real knowledge, he \u201csurrenders unto Me.\u201d Why is this?V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti.The wise man realizes that \u201cV\u0101sudeva [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] is everything.\u201d However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that such a great soul is rarely found. Why is this? If an intelligent person comes to understand that the ultimate goal of life is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, why should he hesitate? Why not surrender immediately? What is the point in waiting for so many births? When one comes to that point of surrender, he becomes a realsanny\u0101s\u012b.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never forces anyone to surrender unto Him. Surrender is a result of love, transcendental love. Where there is force and where there is no freedom, there can be no love. When a mother loves a child, she is not forced to do so, nor does she do so out of expectation of some salary or remuneration.\n\nSimilarly, we can love the Supreme Lord in so many ways \u2013 we can love Him as master, as friend, as child or as husband. There are five basicrasas,or relationships, in which we are eternally related to God. When we are actually in the liberated stage of knowledge, we can understand that our relationship with the Lord is in a particularrasa.That platform is calledsvar\u016bpa-siddhi,or real self-realization. Everyone has an eternal relationship with the Lord, either as master and servant, friend and friend, parent and child, husband and wife, or lover and beloved. These relationships are eternally present. The whole process of spiritual realization and the actual perfection ofyogais to revive our consciousness of this relationship. At present our relationship with the Supreme Lord is pervertedly reflected in this material world. In the material world, the relationship between master and servant is based on money or force or exploitation. There is no question of service out of love. The relationship between master and servant, pervertedly reflected, continues only for so long as the master can pay the servant. As soon as the payment stops, the relationship also stops. Similarly, in the material world there may be a relationship between friends, but as soon as there is a slight disagreement, the friendship breaks, and the friend becomes an enemy. When there is a difference of opinion between son and parents, the son leaves home, and the relationship is severed. The same with husband and wife: a slight difference of opinion, and there is divorce.\n\nNo relationship in this material world is actual or eternal. We must always remember that these ephemeral relationships are simply perverted reflections of that eternal relationship we have with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We have experience that the reflection of an object in a glass is not real. It may appear real, but when we go to touch it we find that there is only glass. We must come to understand that these relationships as friend, parent, child, master, servant, husband, wife or lover are simply reflections of that relationship we have with God. When we come to this platform of understanding, then we are perfect in knowledge. When that knowledge comes, we begin to understand that we are servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that we have an eternal love relationship with Him.\n\nIn this love relationship there is no question of remuneration, but of course remuneration is there, and it is much greater than whatever we earn here through the rendering of service. There is no limit to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s remuneration. In this connection there is the story of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, a very powerful king who conquered a number of planets. The denizens of the heavenly planets appealed to the Supreme Lord to save them, for they had been conquered by the demoniac king Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Upon hearing their pleas, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took the shape of a dwarfbr\u0101hma\u1e47aboy and approached Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, saying, \u201cMy dear king, I would like something from you. You are a great monarch and are renowned for giving in charity to thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,so would you give Me something?\u201d\n\nBali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, \u201cI will give You what You want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI simply want whatever land I can cover in three steps,\u201d the boy said.\n\n\u201cOh, is that all?\u201d the king replied. \u201cAnd what will You do with such a small piece of land?\u201d\n\n\u201cThough it may be small, it will suffice Me,\u201d the boy smiled.\n\nBali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja agreed, and the boy-dwarf took two steps and covered the entire universe. He then asked Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja where He was going to take His third step, and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, understanding that the Supreme Lord was showing him His favor, replied, \u201cMy dear Lord, I have now lost everything. I have no other property, but I do have my head. Would You so kindly step there?\u201d\n\nLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was then very much pleased with Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and He asked, \u201cWhat would you like from Me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected anything from You,\u201d Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said. \u201cBut I understand that You wanted something from me, and now I have offered You everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cbut from My side I have something for you. I shall remain always as an order-carrier servant in your court.\u201d In this way the Lord became Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s doorman, and that was his return. If we offer something to the Lord, it is returned millions of times. But we should not expect this. The Lord is always eager to return the service of His servant. Whoever thinks that the service of the Lord is actually his duty is perfect in knowledge and has attained the perfection ofyoga."

        "chapter_title": "The Perfection of Yoga",
        "chapter_text": "It is a fact,therefore, that in the progress of the living entity toward the perfection ofyoga,birth in a family ofyog\u012bsor devotees is a great boon, for such a birth gives one special impetus.\n\nprayatn\u0101d yatam\u0101nas tuyog\u012b sa\u1e41\u015buddha-kilbi\u1e63a\u1e25aneka-janma-sa\u1e41siddhastato y\u0101ti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\u201cBut when theyog\u012bengages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.\u201d(Bg. 6.45)When one is finally freed from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection of theyogasystem \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Absorption in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the perfect stage, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself confirms:\n\nbah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m antej\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyatev\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam itisa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25\n\n\u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d(Bg. 7.19)Thus after many lifetimes of executing pious activities, when one becomes freed from all contaminations arising from illusory dualities, he engages in the transcendental service of the Lord. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concludes His discourse on this subject in this way:\n\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41mad-gaten\u0101ntar\u0101tman\u0101\u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41sa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25\n\n\u201cAnd of allyog\u012bs,he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me inyogaand is the highest of all.\u201d(Bg. 6.47)\n\nIt therefore follows that the culmination of allyogaslies inbhakti-yoga,the rendering of devotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually, all of theyogasdelineated inBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101end on this note, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate destination of all theyogasystems. From the beginning ofkarma-yogato the end ofbhakti-yogais a long way to self-realization.Karma-yoga,without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. Whenkarma-yogaincreases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is calledj\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,or theyogaof knowledge. Whenj\u00f1\u0101na-yogaincreases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is calleda\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga.And, when one surpassesa\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yogaand comes to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is calledbhakti-yoga,the culmination. Factually,bhakti-yogais the ultimate goal, but to analyzebhakti-yogaminutely one has to understand the other processes. Theyog\u012bwho is progressive is therefore on the true path to eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name \u2013karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b, ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b,etc. \u2013 but if one is fortunate enough to come to the point ofbhakti-yoga,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the otheryogasystems.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the last link in the yogic chain, the link that binds us to the Supreme Person, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without this final link, the chain is practically useless. Those who are truly interested in the perfection of theyogaprocess should immediately take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, understandingBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,and rendering service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through this society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby surpass all other systems and attain the ultimate goal of allyoga\u2013  love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."
