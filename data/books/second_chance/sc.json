        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said to King Par\u012bk\u1e63it: In the city known as K\u0101nyakubja [Kanauj in present-day India] there lived a br\u0101hma\u1e47a named Aj\u0101mila who married a prostitute maidservant and lost all his brahminical qualities because of the association of that low-class woman. Aj\u0101mila gave trouble to others by arresting them, by cheating them in gambling, or by directly plundering them. This was the way he earned his livelihood and maintained his wife and children. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.21\u201322)\n\nThe Law of Consequences\n\nAlthough Aj\u0101mila was born of abr\u0101hma\u1e47afather and strictly followed the regulative principles \u2013 no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, and no gambling \u2013 he fell in love with a prostitute, and therefore all his good qualities were lost. As soon as a person abandons the regulative principles, he engages in various kinds of sinful activities. The regulative principles serve to keep us on the standard of human life. But if we abandon them, we fall down into illusory life, orm\u0101y\u0101.\n\nIf we want to advance in spiritual life, we must follow the regulative principles and rectify the mistakes of our past lives and this present life. Only those who have become free from all kinds of sinful reactions and are now engaged in pious activities can fully understand God. Persons who commit sinful activities and who are overly attached to bodily comforts and mundane friendship, society, and family affection cannot be spiritually self-realized.\n\nThe fault of illicit connection with women is that it destroys all one\u2019s brahminical qualities. Aj\u0101mila abandoned all the regulative principles due to his association with a prostitute. He became a cheater and a thief. One who acts dishonestly will be punished. He may escape the king\u2019s or government\u2019s law, but he can never escape God\u2019s law. The materialists think, \u201cI am cheating God, and I can continue to gratify my senses by all nefarious activities.\u201d But the\u015b\u0101stras(scriptures) state that such persons are cheating their own happiness in the end, because they will have to accept a material body again and suffer accordingly.\n\nA man who is born in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily is expected to be truthful and self-controlled, to be fully cognizant of spiritual life and its practical application, and to have complete faith in the statements of the\u015b\u0101stras.\n\nIf a person does not follow the\u015b\u0101stras,he becomes degraded. The great sages and\u1e5b\u1e63isthroughout the world have given guidance, and their words are recorded in the\u015b\u0101stras.But rascals and fools misinterpret the scriptures and misguide the people. At present, theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101is interpreted in so many different ways, and these so-called explanations are accepted by the innocent public as authoritative knowledge. One interpreter explains that the battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra refers to the material body and that the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava brothers are really the five senses of the material body. But this is not the proper understanding. How can anyone explain theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101when he does not understand it? Such an attempt is nonsense.\n\nTo understand the bona fide science of God, one must approach a bona fide spiritual master and hear theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101from him. We have to follow the great personalities, the previous\u0101c\u0101ryas(spiritual masters). That will be to our profit. We should not speculate and make up our own statements. We should simply accept the injunctions given by the great\u0101c\u0101ryas, because that is the process of the Vedic system. One must approach a bona fide spiritual master and inquire from him submissively. The Absolute Truth is explained in the scriptures, and the scriptures are explained by the spiritual master or a saintly person. Whatever the bona fide, self-realized spiritual master says must be accepted.\n\nThere is no room for interpretation of the\u015b\u0101stras. In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lifted Govardhana Hill just as a child lifts a mushroom. He did it so easily, but people do not believe it. Those who do not believe in theBh\u0101gavataminterpret an indirect meaning. The meaning is clear, and there is nothing to be misunderstood, but these rascals draw their own conclusions nonetheless.\n\nWhen the language is clear, why should we interpret? By interpretation, so-called scholars and theologians have played havoc with the Vedic literature. No bona fide\u0101c\u0101ryahas ever interpreted the\u015b\u0101strasaccording to his own whims, but many so-called modern scholars and leaders have done so, and therefore people are gliding down into the most abominable conditions of material existence. In the interest of the people, these rascals should be exposed. Therefore we are presenting theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is.\n\nThe Degradation of Modern Society\n\nHere the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamsays that thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aAj\u0101mila became attached to a prostitute and thus lost his brahminical qualifications. He was a young man of about twenty when this happened. Because of his illicit association with the prostitute, Aj\u0101mila was forced to live by begging, borrowing, stealing, and gambling.\n\nThese verses indicate how degraded one becomes simply by indulging in illicit sex with a prostitute. Illicit sex is not possible with chaste women, but only with unchaste women. The more society allows prostitution and illicit sex, the more impetus it gives to cheaters, thieves, plunderers, drunkards, and gamblers. Therefore we first advise all the disciples in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to avoid illicit sex, which is the beginning of all abominable life and which is followed by meat-eating, gambling, and intoxication, one after another. Of course, restraint is difficult, but it is quite possible if one fully surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since all abominable habits gradually become distasteful for a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person.\n\nWhile in his time Aj\u0101mila was an exception, in the present age there are millions of Aj\u0101milas. But if illicit sex is allowed to increase, the entire society will be condemned, for it will be full of rogues, thieves, cheaters, and so forth.\n\nTherefore, if we actually want to improve the world situation, we have to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as that gives the best service to human society, both materially and spiritually. Whatever abominable characteristics we have developed, we have only to take to the process ofbhakti-yoga, or devotional service, in order to completely eradicate them. We have developed so manyanarthas, or unwanted habits, the chief of which are meat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. But we can curb them by accepting the principles ofbhakti-yogaas they are presented in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101and the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.Scarcely anyone knows these Vedic scriptures, and therefore no one heeds their instructions. People would rather read all kinds of books by all kinds of rascals, but the result of such books is to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIn illusion a person may think he can get rid of unwanted habits and be saved by some artificial, mystic meditation. And in fact at one time it was possible to attain liberation by practicinga\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, or eightfold yogic meditation. But at present almost no one can follow this process, and artificial attempts at yoga will not help us.\n\nTherefore to help the fallen people of this Age of Kali, the Supreme Lord appeared five hundred years ago as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. He knew that the people of this age would not even be able to follow the regulative principles, what to speak of practicinga\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga.Therefore He gave themah\u0101-mantra \u2013Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 so that we can gradually be elevated to the highest position of spiritual life. Other processes of purification or sacrifice cannot be followed in this age, because for the most part people are too degraded. But anyone may take to this process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it is said in theB\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a(3.8.126),\n\nharer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\n\n\u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d Chanting the holy name of the Lord is always superbly effective, but it is especially effective in this Age of Kali. Its practical effectiveness will now be explained by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b through the history of Aj\u0101mila, who was freed from the hands of Yamar\u0101ja, the universal judge, simply because of chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nThe Dangers of Illicit Sex\n\nTo benefit fully from chanting the holy name of the Lord, one needs to chant offenselessly. And to guarantee offenseless chanting, some austerity is required. First of all, one should not indulge in illicit sex. Sex is one of the bodily needs, so it is sanctioned in the\u015b\u0101strasto some degree: one is allowed to live peacefully with one\u2019s wife and have sex for begetting children. Other than to beget children, however, there is no need of indulging in sex. One who does not take the responsibility of family life but remains a bachelor and engages in illicit sex is considered irresponsible, and he will have to suffer the consequences.\n\nOf course, one who thinks that family life is too big a responsibility can forgo it and thus avoid a lot of trouble. Family responsibility is very great; therefore if a man feels he cannot accept the responsibility, he should remain abrahmac\u0101r\u012b, a celibate student. A person who practices the science ofbrahmacaryaunder the care of a spiritual master automatically becomes seventy-five percent free from material entanglement.\n\nToday, however, no one wants to undergo the austerities ofbrahmacarya. Everyone wants to remain unmarried but also engage in sex. In this way people are losing all good character. To maintain a woman who is nothing more than a prostitute and engage in illicit sex with her for producing children is sinful. Such children are unwanted (var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara), and in this way society becomes degraded.\n\nAj\u0101mila became attracted to a prostitute, and with her he begot ten children. He became so degraded that he could not execute honest business to support his large family, and he was forced to beg, borrow, and steal to maintain them. If a person indulges in illicit sex, intoxication and gambling automatically follow. His expenses will be unlimited, and to meet all his expenses he will have to adopt methods of cheating and stealing. The basis for Aj\u0101mila\u2019s degradation was his illicit connection with the prostitute.\n\nTherefore, in the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we do not allow any illicit sex. Devotees must either get married or remain celibate; this regulation is very effective for maintaining a high standard of purity."

        "chapter_title": "In Imitation Of the Original",
        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: My dear king, eighty-eight years of his life passed by while Aj\u0101mila thus spent his time in abominable, sinful activities to maintain his family of ten sons and the prostitute. The youngest child was a baby named N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who was naturally very dear to his father and mother. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.23\u201324)\n\nParental Affection\n\nAj\u0101mila\u2019s sinfulness is shown by the fact that although he was eighty-eight years old, he had a very young child. According to Vedic culture, one should leave home as soon as he has reached fifty years of age; one should not live at home and go on producing children. Sex is allowed for twenty-five years, between the ages of twenty-five and fifty. After that one should give up the habit of sex and leave home as av\u0101naprasthaand then properly takesanny\u0101sa. Aj\u0101mila, however, because of his association with a prostitute, lost all brahminical culture and became most sinful, even in his so-called household life.\n\nAj\u0101mila was a young man of twenty when he met the prostitute, and he begot ten children in her. When he was almost ninety years old, the time came when he was to die. At that time most of his children were grown up, so naturally the youngest child, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, became his parents\u2019 favorite, and Aj\u0101mila was very much attached to him.\n\nA baby\u2019s smile immediately attracts the father, mother, and relatives. When the child begins to talk, making sounds in broken language, it is very joyful for the parents. Unless this attraction is there, it is not possible to raise the child with affection. Parental affection is natural even among the animal species. In Kanpur, a monkey once came with her baby near the room where we were staying. The baby monkey entered the window through the bars, and the mother became very upset. She became mad with anxiety. Somehow or other we pushed the baby monkey out of the bars, and immediately the mother embraced the baby and took it away with her.\n\nIn human society, the affection between a mother and her child is very much eulogized, but as we see, this relationship is visible even among the animals. Therefore it is not an outstanding qualification; it is material nature\u2019s law. Unless the mother and child are affectionately connected, it is not possible for the child to grow up. Parental affection is natural and necessary, but it does not raise one to the spiritual platform.\n\nThe character of the debauchee Aj\u0101mila was abominable, but he was still very affectionate toward his youngest child. Although Aj\u0101mila was nearly ninety, he was still enjoying the child\u2019s playful pastimes, just as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda and Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 enjoyed the childhood pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nSpiritual Affection and Variety\n\nParental affection in this material world is a perverted reflection of parental affection in the spiritual world, where it is found in its pure, original form. Everything originates with the transcendental reality. As stated in theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra(1.1.2),janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:\u201cThe Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates.\u201d If the affection between a child and his parents did not exist in the Absolute Truth, it could not exist in the material world.\n\nSince the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, whatever varieties we see here in this material world are simply reflections of the varieties in the spiritual world. If the Absolute Truth were without variety, then where have all these varieties come from? No, the Absolute Truth is not impersonal (nir\u0101k\u0101ra) or without variety (nirvi\u015be\u1e63a).\n\nStill, some persons, called M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, are so disappointed and frustrated with the imperfect varieties of this material world that they imagine the spiritual world to be impersonal and without variety. These impersonalists realize that they are Brahman, or spirit, but they do not know that there are innumerable planets in thebrahmajyoti, or spiritual atmosphere. They think that thebrahmajyotiitself is all-in-all. The impersonalists have no information of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and due to their imperfect knowledge they again come down to these material planets. As said in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(10.2.32):\n\nye \u2019nye \u2019ravind\u0101k\u1e63a vimukta-m\u0101ninastvayy asta-bh\u0101v\u0101d avi\u015buddha-buddhaya\u1e25\u0101ruhya-k\u1e5bcchrena para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25patanty adho \u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta yu\u1e63mad a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25\n\n\u201cAlthough impersonalists are almost liberated, still, on account of their negligence of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their intelligence is not yet purified. Thus despite performing severe austerities to rise up to the platform of Brahman, they must fall down again to this material world.\u201d\n\nSpiritual Form and Spiritual Pastimes\n\nThe impersonalist philosophers cannot differentiate between activities in the material world and similar activities in the spiritual world. Nor do they differentiate between the material form and God\u2019s form. They are convinced that the impersonalbrahmajyoti,the spiritual effulgence emanating from the Lord\u2019s body, is the Supreme Absolute Truth. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs mistakenly assume that when God appears He accepts a material body, just as we have taken this material form in the material world. That kind of thinking is impersonalism, or M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy.\n\nGod has a form, but not a material form like ours. His form issac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha[Bs.5.1],a spiritual form full of eternity, bliss, and knowledge. Anyone who understands the transcendental nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form achieves perfection. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.9):\n\njanma karma ca me divyameva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janmanaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\n\n\u201cWhen I come, I do not accept a material body; My birth and activities are completely spiritual. And anyone who perfectly understands this is liberated.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a displayed Himself as the perfect child before Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, He would break everything when she did not supply Him with butter \u2013 as if He were in need of butter! So God can display Himself exactly like an ordinary human being, yet He remains the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nImpersonalists cannot know God because they see Him as an ordinary man. This is rascaldom, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.11):avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25.\u201cOnly rascals accept Me as an ordinary human being.\u201d The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs say, \u201cOh, here is a child. How can He be God?\u201d Even Brahm\u0101 and Indra became bewildered. They thought, \u201cHow can this boy be the Supreme Lord? Let me test Him.\u201d\n\nSometimes a so-called incarnation of God declares, \u201cI am God.\u201d He should be tested to determine whether or not he is actually God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs are claiming, \u201cI am God, I am K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I am R\u0101ma.\u201d Everyone becomes \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d everyone becomes \u201cR\u0101ma,\u201d yet people do not challenge their claims: \u201cIf you are R\u0101ma, exhibit your supreme potency! R\u0101ma constructed a bridge over the Indian Ocean. What have you done? At the age of seven, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lifted Govardhana Hill. What have you done?\u201d When they are challenged by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes, these rascals say, \u201cIt is all fiction; it is all legend.\u201d Therefore people accept an ordinary person as R\u0101ma or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This nonsense is going on, and both those who declare themselves to be God and those who accept them as God will have to suffer for it. Anyone can claim to be God, and any foolish person can accept, but no one will benefit by serving a false God.\n\nOnce Lord Brahm\u0101 thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might also be such a false God. He observed that a mere boy in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, India, was accepted as the Supreme Lord and that He was performing extraordinary activities. So Brahm\u0101 decided to make a test. He took away all of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s calves and playmates and hid them. When Brahm\u0101 returned to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana after one year and saw the same calves and playmates still there, he could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had expanded Himself by His unlimited potency into so many calves and boys. The boys\u2019 own mothers could not detect that their sons were K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expansions, though the mothers could not explain why every evening when their boys returned home from the fields, their affection for them increased more and more. Finally, Brahm\u0101 surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, composing very nice prayers in glorification of the Lord.\n\nSimilarly, Indra became bewildered when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told His father, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cThere is no need of performing sacrifices to Indra, because he is under the order of the Supreme Lord.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not say to Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cI am the Supreme Lord,\u201d but He said, \u201cIndra is under the order of the Supreme Lord; therefore he has to supply you with water. So there is no need of performing thisyaj\u00f1a[sacrifice] to him.\u201d\n\nWhen the sacrifice to Indra was stopped, he became furious and tried to punish the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by sending incessant torrents of rain for seven days. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana was nearly drowned in water \u2013 so great was the downpour. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a child of about seven years, immediately lifted Govardhana Hill and invited all the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, together with their animals, to take shelter underneath the hill. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a held up the hill for seven days and nights without taking any food or rest, just to protect the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Thus Indra understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nIn this way the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwarns that if even great personalities like Brahm\u0101 and Indra can sometimes become bewildered bym\u0101y\u0101,the external manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then what to speak of us.\n\nSo, God sometimes displays Himself as God and sometimes as a human being, but the rascal impersonalists dismiss His pastimes as legend or mythology. Either they do not believe in the\u015b\u0101strasor they interpret them in their own way, usingardha-kukku\u1e6d\u012b-ny\u0101ya,\u201cthe logic of half a hen.\u201d Once a man kept a hen that delivered a golden egg every day. The foolish man thought, \u201cIt is very profitable, but it is expensive to feed this hen. Better that I cut off her head and save the expense of feeding her. Then I will get the egg without any charge.\u201d The impersonalists accept the\u015b\u0101strasin this way. They think, \u201cOh, this is not good; it is inconvenient. We shall cut this portion out.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cOne should see Me everywhere,\u201d the rascal M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs think it is very palatable, but when He says, \u201cGive up everything and surrender to Me,\u201d they disagree. They accept what is convenient and reject what is not. But the\u0101c\u0101ryasdo not distort the\u015b\u0101strasin this way. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Arjuna said, \u201cI accept whatever You have said.\u201d\n\nThe Absolute Truth Full of Knowledge\n\nTheVed\u0101nta-s\u016btrais accepted as the supreme authority of all Vedic literature. And theVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra(1.1.2) says,janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:\u201cThe Absolute Truth is the original source of everything.\u201dJanmameans \u201cbirth.\u201d There is no question of interpretation; the meaning is clear. Everything in this material world comes out of the Absolute Truth, just as this body comes out of the womb of our mother.Janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25:\u201cBeginning from birth up to the annihilation, everything is an emanation from the Absolute Truth.\u201d The Absolute Truth is that which is the source of everything, the reservoir of everything, and the maintainer of everything.\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the original source? The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.1.1) says,janm\u0101dy asya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b c\u0101rthe\u015bv abhij\u00f1a\u1e25 svar\u0101\u1e6d:The original source of everything must be supremely cognizant of everything, both directly and indirectly. He is the supreme spirit, and He knows everything because He is perfect. We are also spirit \u2013 spiritual sparks \u2013 and as soon as a spiritual spark takes shelter in the womb of a mother, it develops a body. That means that the spiritual spark is the source of the body and all its mechanisms. Although it is by our energy that this body is produced, we do not know how our veins are created or how our bones are created. And because we do not know, we are not God. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows. This is the characteristic of the Absolute Truth: He knows everything. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.26): \u201cI know everything that has happened in the past, everything that is happening now, and everything that will happen in the future.\u201d\n\nWe become cognizant of the Absolute Truth by accepting knowledge from a spiritual master, but how has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a become perfectly cognizant? How is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s knowledge so perfect? Because He is fully independent (svar\u0101\u1e6d). He does not have to learn anything from anyone. Some rascal may try to realize himself as God by taking knowledge from a M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God without taking knowledge from anyone. That is God."

        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: Because of the child\u2019s broken language and awkward movements, old Aj\u0101mila was very much attached to him. He always took care of the child and enjoyed his activities. When Aj\u0101mila chewed food and ate it, he called the child to chew and eat, and when he drank he called the child to drink also. Always engaged in taking care of the child and calling his name, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Aj\u0101mila could not understand that his own time was now exhausted and that death was upon him.\n\nWhen the time of death arrived for the foolish Aj\u0101mila, he began thinking exclusively of his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.25\u201327)\n\nA Child\u2019s Name\n\nHere it is clearly mentioned that the child N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a was so young that he could not even speak or walk properly. Since the old man was very attached to the child, he enjoyed the child\u2019s activities, and because the child\u2019s name was N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the old man always chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Although Aj\u0101mila was referring to the small child and not to the original N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is so powerful that even by chanting his son\u2019s name he was becoming purified. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has therefore declared that if one\u2019s mind is somehow or other attracted by the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tasm\u0101t ken\u0101py up\u0101yena mana\u1e25k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e nive\u015bayet), one is on the path of liberation. In India even today parents often give their children names of God, such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Thus the parents chant the names K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and get the chance to be purified.\n\nAt the time of death, Aj\u0101mila was chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in connection with his youngest child. Since Aj\u0101mila was the son of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a, he had been accustomed to worshiping N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in his youth, because in everybr\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019shouse there is worship of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.Therefore, although the contaminated Aj\u0101mila was calling for his son, by concentrating his mind on the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a he remembered the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth.\n\nThe value of remembering N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death is explained in the Second Canto of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(2.1.6):\n\net\u0101v\u0101n s\u0101\u1e45khya-yog\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41svadharma-parini\u1e63\u1e6dhay\u0101janma-l\u0101bha\u1e25 para\u1e25 pu\u1e41s\u0101mante n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25\n\n\u201cThe highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by acquirement of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of one\u2019s occupational duty, is to remember N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, at the end of life.\u201d\n\nSomehow or other, therefore, Aj\u0101mila consciously or unconsciously chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death and became all-perfect.\n\nDeath, a Critical Time of Life\n\nAs mentioned above, one\u2019s mentality at the time of death is all-important. But if we become complacent and think, \u201cOh, death takes place \u2013 what of it?\u201d then we cannot advance on the spiritual path. Just as the air carries fragrances, so a person\u2019s mentality at the time of death will carry him to his next life. If he has cultivated the mentality of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he will immediately be transferred to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. But if he has cultivated the mentality of an ordinarykarm\u012b,a fruitive worker, then he will have to stay in this material world to suffer the consequences of the kind of mentality he has thus created.\n\nSuppose I am a businessman. If I simply do business up till the point of death, naturally my mentality will be business. One Calcutta businessman at the time of death asked about the management of his mill. He might have taken his next birth as a rat in his mill. This is possible. At the time of death, whatever you are thinking will carry you to your next body. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very kind, and whatever mentality one is absorbed in at the time of death, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will provide an appropriate body: \u201cAll right, you are thinking like a rat? Become a rat.\u201d \u201cYou are thinking like a tiger? Become a tiger.\u201d \u201cYou are thinking like My devotee? Come to Me.\u201d\n\nBy chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we can mold our thoughts so that we are always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(6.47),yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 mad-gaten\u0101ntar\u0101tman\u0101:\u201cThe first-class yogi is he who always thinks of Me within his heart.\u201d The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is especially meant for helping the members of human society come to this state of full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Then at the end of life one will simply remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whatever you practice throughout your life will determine your consciousness at death. That is natural.\n\nOne who properly prepares for the time of death is really intelligent, while one who thinks he can remain at home forever and enjoy the association of his wife and children is a fool. In illusion a man thinks, \u201cMy bank balance, my nice house, and my family will protect me.\u201dBut these cannot protect anyone. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(2.1.4)declares,\n\ndeh\u0101patya-kalatr\u0101di\u1e63v\u0101tma-sainye\u1e63v asatsv apite\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 pramatto nidhana\u1e41pa\u015byann api na pa\u015byati\n\n\u201cOne who is mad thinks, \u2018My strong body, my grown-up children, my good wife, and my bank balance will save me.\u2019 \u201d We are simply struggling in this material world like soldiers fighting on a battlefield. Our soldiers are our children, our wife, our bank balance, our countrymen, etc. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamwarns us not to take shelter of such fallible soldiers. Even though a man has seen that his father and grandfather, who were once living, are existing no more, he does not see that likewise everyone, including himself, will be destroyed. How can he protect his son? How can his son protect him? These questions do not arise for the materialist who is simply engrossed in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending, and mating."

        "chapter_title": "Neither Birth Nor Death",
        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: Aj\u0101mila then saw three awkward persons with deformed bodily features, fierce, twisted faces, and hair standing erect on their bodies. With ropes in their hands, they had come to take him away to the abode of Yamar\u0101ja. When he saw them he was extremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who was playing nearby, Aj\u0101mila began to call him loudly by his name. Thus with tears in his eyes he somehow or other chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.28\u201329)\n\nAnxious to Save Themselves from Death\n\nAt the time of death people become very anxious to save themselves, especially those who have been sinful. Of course, the soul itself is not subject to death (na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne\u015bar\u012bre), but leaving the present body and entering into another body is very painful. At death the living entity can no longer bear to remain in his present body \u2013 the pain is so acute. Sometimes when a person\u2019s life becomes too painful he commits suicide. But suicide is a sin punishable by the laws ofkarma.\n\nWhen Aj\u0101mila was dying, he saw three ferocious and very frightening persons with ropes in their hands, unruly hair on their heads, and bodily hair like bristles. These assistants of Yamar\u0101ja, the Yamad\u016btas, had come to drag Aj\u0101mila out of his body and take him to the court of Yamar\u0101ja. Sometimes a dying man cries out in fear when he sees the Yamad\u016btas. Aj\u0101mila, too, became very fearful.\n\nFortunately, even though Aj\u0101mila was referring to his son, he chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and therefore the order-carriers of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, also immediately arrived there. Because Aj\u0101mila was extremely afraid of the ropes of Yamar\u0101ja, he chanted the Lord\u2019s name with tearful eyes. Actually, however, he never meant to chant the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; he meant to call his son.\n\nThe Appearance and Disappearance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His Devotees\n\nOne may ask, \u201cThe devotees die, and the nondevotees also die. What is the difference?\u201d It is like this: The mother cat may catch a rat and carry it in her mouth, and she also carries her kittens in her mouth. It is the same mouth, but the kittens are comfortable and safe, whereas the rat is feeling the jaws of death. Similarly, at the time of death the devotees are transferred to the spiritual realm, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, whereas the ordinary sinful man is dragged down to the hellish regions by the Yamad\u016btas, the constables of Yamar\u0101ja. This was apparently to be Aj\u0101mila\u2019s fate.\n\nIn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.9)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,janma karma ca me divyam:\u201cMy appearance and disappearance are spiritual, transcendental; they are not ordinary.\u201d Why does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appear in this world? That He explains in the previous verse(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.8):\n\nparitr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101mdharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pan\u0101rth\u0101yasambhav\u0101mi yuge yuge\n\n\u201cTo deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I appear millennium after millennium.\u201d God\u2019s only business is to protect the faithful devotees and to kill the demoniac. Therefore we find Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u pictured with His weapons, the club andcakra(disc), for protecting the devotees, and the lotus flower and conch for their benediction.\n\nSimilarly transcendental are the appearance and disappearance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees who are sent to this material world to preach the glories of the Lord. According to the principles of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism, both the appearance and the disappearance of such Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), are all-auspicious. Therefore we hold festivals in their honor on the anniversaries of both days.\n\nActually, even ordinary living entities never take birth or die, what to speak of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees. Sometimes atheistic men say God is dead. They do not know that even the smallest living entity does not die. So how can God be dead? Atheists are described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101asm\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101s, or foolish rascals. They have no knowledge but pose themselves as learned men and mutter something that is good neither for them nor the public.\n\nLiberation via Thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\n\nBecause somehow or other Aj\u0101mila became absorbed in thinking of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at the time of death, he immediately became eligible for liberation, even though he had acted sinfully throughout his entire life. One can think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any capacity. Thegop\u012bs,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s cowherd girlfriends, were absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of what appeared to be lusty desire, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la became absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of anger, and Ka\u1e41sa incessantly thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of fear. Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la were demons, but because they thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead throughout their lives and at the time of death, they were granted liberation by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.\n\nOf course, it is best if one thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably.Bhakti,or devotional service,means thinking favorably of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and Ka\u1e41sa were not devotees, because the worddevoteeimplies someone who is favorably disposed toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the opposite way, however, is also accepted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that anyone who thinks of Him always, even as an enemy, becomes the greatest yogi and attains liberation. Thus the results of yogic performances and austerities were achieved even by such inimical personalities as Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. In the impersonal Brahman effulgence (brahmajyoti) we find not only the highest learned scholars (j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs), who have struggled to attain Brahman, but also those persons who constantly think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in enmity. They also enter into that spiritual effulgence. Thus the destination achieved by thej\u00f1\u0101n\u012bsis also achieved by the enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This, however, is not very desirable.\n\nA living entity can remain for some time in the Brahman effulgence (brahmajyoti) as a tiny shining spiritual particle. As there are many molecular particles of sunshine, similarly the living entities can live as small particles of spiritual effulgence in thebrahmajyoti. But they are subject to fall down into this material creation again. By nature the living entities want varieties of sense enjoyment, but in that impersonal existence there are no varieties of enjoyment. So when they desire to enjoy, they have to come again to this material world. Therefore, if one merges into the Brahman effulgence, there is every chance of falling down.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees do not desire liberation, because their only interest is to be engaged in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whether in the material world or in the spiritual world. Still, by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they attain liberation by being elevated to the planet of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the residence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, where the material miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease are conspicuous by their absence. Thus a devotee\u2019s position is different from that of the impersonalists andj\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. The devotee\u2019s position is very exalted. He also passes through the Brahman effulgence, but he is not attracted to it. He is attracted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, especially Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead lives eternally with His associates."

The order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja were snatching the soul from the core of Aj\u0101mila\u2019s heart, but with resounding voices the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas forbade them to do so. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.30\u201331)\n\nThe Messengers Dispatched by the Lord\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas, who are the assistants of Yamar\u0101ja, the superintendent of death, had come to drag Aj\u0101mila away. Aj\u0101mila appealed to his youngest son, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a: \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, please come here! I\u2019m dying!\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that as soon as He heard Aj\u0101mila chant \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a!\u201d at the time of his death, He immediately dispatched His assistants, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, to give Aj\u0101mila shelter.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas came because they heard Aj\u0101mila chant the holy name of their master, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, without considering why he was chanting. While chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Aj\u0101mila was actually thinking of his son, but simply because they heard Aj\u0101mila chant the Lord\u2019s name, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas immediately came for Aj\u0101mila\u2019s protection. Chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name is actually meant for His glorification. Aj\u0101mila, however, did not glorify the Lord: he simply chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because of his excessive attachment to his son. Nevertheless, because of his past good fortune in having rendered devotional service to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in his youth, he apparently chanted the holy name in full devotional service and without offense. Thus that chanting was sufficient to cleanse him of all sinful reactions and assure him the protection of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas.\n\nThe name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a has the full potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the secret ofn\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana,chanting the names of God. By chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we make immediate contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The reason for this is that the Lord\u2019s name is not material: it is spiritual and absolute. Thus there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His name.\n\nSnatching the Soul\n\nWhen the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas arrived, they spoke to the Yamad\u016btas with extreme gravity: \u201cWhat are you doing? Stop! You cannot take this man to Yamar\u0101ja!\u201d\n\nA Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is always protected by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s order-carriers. Because Aj\u0101mila had chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas not only immediately arrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamad\u016btas not to touch him. By speaking with resounding voices, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas threatened to punish the Yamad\u016btas if they continued trying to snatch Aj\u0101mila\u2019s soul from his heart. The order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja have jurisdiction over all sinful living entities, but the messengers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are capable of punishing anyone, including Yamar\u0101ja, if he wrongs a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.\n\nModern scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body with their material instruments, but here the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamclearly explains that the soul is within the core of the heart (h\u1e5bdaya); it is from the heart that the Yamad\u016btas were trying to extract the soul of Aj\u0101mila. The heart is part of the mechanical arrangement of the body. As the Lord says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.61):\n\n\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41h\u1e5bd-de\u015be \u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhatibhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101niyantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of the material energy.\u201dYantrameans \u201cmachine,\u201d such as an automobile. The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its director or proprietor, but the supreme director and proprietor is the Personality of Godhead in His form as the Supersoul.\n\nOne\u2019s body is created through the agency ofm\u0101y\u0101according to one\u2019s activities in one\u2019s past life; and according to one\u2019s activities in this life,m\u0101y\u0101creates another body for the next life. At the appropriate time, one\u2019s next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration of the soul.\n\nDuring transmigration from one body to the next, the sinful soul is taken away by the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja and put into a particular type of hellish life in order to become accustomed to the condition in which he will live in his next body."

        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: When the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, the son of the sun god, were thus forbidden, they replied, \u201cWho are you, sirs, that have the audacity to challenge the jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja? Whose servants are you, where have you come from, and why are you forbidding us to touch the body of Aj\u0101mila? Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the best of devotees? Your eyes are just like the petals of lotus flowers. Dressed in yellow silken garments, decorated with garlands of lotuses, and wearing very attractive helmets on your heads and earrings on your ears, you all appear fresh and youthful. Your four long arms are decorated with bows and quivers of arrows and with swords, clubs, conchshells, discs, and lotus flowers. Your effulgence has dissipated the darkness here with extraordinary illumination. Now, sirs, why are you obstructing us?\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.32\u201336)\n\nDivine Interference\n\nThe sins Aj\u0101mila had committed placed him within the jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja, the supreme judge appointed to consider the sins of the living entities. When forbidden to touch Aj\u0101mila, the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja were surprised, because within all the three worlds no one had ever before hindered them in the execution of their duty.\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were coming from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and they appeared extraordinary, each with four arms. The servants of Yamar\u0101ja immediately received them with respect. They had no idea which planet the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had come from, so they simply suggested, \u201cYou must have come from a very exalted planet, but why are you interfering with our business? We are Yamad\u016btas. It is our duty to arrest every sinful man, and Aj\u0101mila has committed misdeeds throughout his life. Now, at the end of his life, we are authorized to take him to Yamar\u0101ja, the son of Vivasv\u0101n, the sun god, so why are you preventing us?\u201d\n\nThe most significant word used in verse 32 issiddha-sattam\u0101\u1e25, which means \u201cthe best of the perfect.\u201d In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.3)it is said,manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sahasre\u1e63u ka\u015bcid yatatisiddhaye:out of millions of persons, one may try to becomesiddha, perfect \u2013 or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi). At present almost no one is aware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore calledsiddha. When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Soul, one becomessiddha-sattama. One is then eligible to live in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. The wordsiddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a pure devotee of the Lord.\n\nSince the Yamad\u016btas are servants of Yamar\u0101ja, who is also one of thesiddha-sattamas,they knew that asiddha-sattamais above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world. The Yamad\u016btas therefore inquired why the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were preventing them from carrying out the orders of such an exalted soul as Yamar\u0101ja.\n\nIt should also be noted that Aj\u0101mila was not yet dead, for the Yamad\u016btas had been stopped before they could snatch the soul from his heart. Aj\u0101mila was simply on the verge of death as the argument progressed between the Yamad\u016btas and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. The conclusion of that argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Aj\u0101mila.\n\nSpiritual Beauty\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas exactly resembled Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Yamad\u016btas had never seen them before, because the Yamad\u016btas stay in an atmosphere where only sinful activities are executed. Therefore they were astonished at the presence of these beautiful personalities and said, \u201cBy your bodily features you appear to be very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this material world with your effulgence. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our duty?\u201d It will be explained that the Yamad\u016btas, the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, mistakenly considered Aj\u0101mila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified by constantly chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were so effulgent because they were residents of the spiritual world, where everyone and everything is self-effulgent. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(15.6),na tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo na \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25:\u201cMy abode is not illuminated by the sun, the moon, fire, or electricity.\u201d The Yamad\u016btas did not know where the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had come from, but they could see that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were not ordinary, since they were so effulgent, they had four arms, and they were extremely beautiful.\n\nThe dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha are accurately described in these verses. The residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms holding a disc, flower, club, and conchshell. Thus they exactly resemble Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2013 except for one very prominent feature: the Kaustubha jewel, which the Lord wears on His chest. The residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha have the same bodily features as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because they have attained the liberation ofs\u0101r\u016bpya, but they nevertheless act as servants. All the residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka know perfectly well that their master is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who arenitya-mukta,everlastingly liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, they never do so; they always remain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka. Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement will always remain in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka and have nothing to do with the material world.\n\nBeyond the Material World\n\nIn our conditioned state, we cannot know about the spiritual world. But the spiritual world exists. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.20),paras tasm\u0101t tu bh\u0101vo \u2019nyo:\u201cBesides this inferior, material nature there is another, superior nature.\u201d This material nature is one nature, comprised of millions and trillions of universes clustered together in one corner of the spiritual sky. We cannot even measure the sky covered by this one universe, within which there are innumerable planets; yet there are millions and trillions of universes in the entire material creation. And the entire material creation is only one fourth of existence. In other words, this whole material world is existing in one fourth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. The other three fourths comprise the spiritual sky. Unfortunate persons think that this planet is all in all, but this is frog philosophy. A frog in a well cannot understand anything beyond the well, and he measures everything in terms of his well. When he is told about the ocean, he cannot imagine it. Similarly, persons with such a frog\u2019s mentality imagine, \u201cGod is like this,\u201d or \u201cGod\u2019s kingdom is like that,\u201d or \u201cI am God,\u201d or \u201cThere is no God.\u201d But this is all foolishness."

        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: Being thus addressed by the messengers of Yamar\u0101ja, the servants of V\u0101sudeva smiled and spoke the following words in voices as deep as the sound of rumbling clouds: \u201cIf you are actually servants of Yamar\u0101ja, you must explain to us the meaning of religious principles and the symptoms of irreligion. What is the process of punishing others? Who are the actual candidates for punishment? Are all persons engaged in fruitive activities punishable, or only some of them?\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.37\u201339)\n\nWhat the Representatives of Dharma Should Know\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas protested to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, \u201cYou are so exalted that it is not very good for you to interfere with our business.\u201d The Yamad\u016btas were surprised to see that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, although exalted souls, were hindering the rule of Yamar\u0101ja. Similarly, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were also surprised that the Yamad\u016btas, although claiming to be servants of Yamar\u0101ja, the supreme judge of religious principles, were unaware of the principles of religion. Thus the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas smiled, thinking, \u201cWhat is this nonsense they are speaking? If they are actually servants of Yamar\u0101ja, they should know that Aj\u0101mila is not a suitable candidate for them to carry off.\u201d\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas began to speak in grave voices: \u201cYou claim to be the representatives of Dharmar\u0101ja [Yamar\u0101ja], the superintendent of death and the maintainer of religion, and you accuse us of interfering in your business, which he has entrusted to you. Therefore would you kindly explain what isdharma, or religion, and what isadharma, or irreligion? If you are actually representatives of Yamar\u0101ja, then you can answer this question.\u201d\n\nThis inquiry put by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas to the Yamad\u016btas is most important. A servant must know the instructions of his master. The servants of Yamar\u0101ja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas very intelligently asked them to explain religious and irreligious principles. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord says,sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cGive up all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d Therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion. Those who have surrendered to the demands of material nature instead of to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all impious, regardless of their material position. Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.15):\n\nna m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are the lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me.\u201d\n\nThe question posed by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas was very suitable. One who represents someone else must fully know that person\u2019s mission. The devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must therefore be fully aware of the mission of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya and the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; otherwise they will be considered foolish.\n\nLord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has said,yei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei \u2018guru\u2019 haya:\u201cOne must know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 then he can become a guru.\u201d Not just anyone can become a guru. Thus the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas challenged the Yamad\u016btas: \u201cIf you are truly representatives of Dharmar\u0101ja, then you must explain what is religion and what is irreligion.\u201d That should be the criterion for determining who is actually a representative of religion. It is not that everyone should be accepted as religious or as a guru. Widespread ignorance has given rise to many persons calling themselves God, representing so much nonsense in the name ofdharma. When someone says, \u201cI am God,\u201d or \u201cI have become God by mystic yoga,\u201d one should challenge him. In America a man claimed, \u201cI am God, everyone is God,\u201d and thus gathered disciples. One day he was suffering from a toothache, and I asked him, \u201cWhat kind of God are you that you are suffering so much from a toothache?\u201d Only a lunatic or a cheater claims, \u201cI am God.\u201d\n\nOfficers of Law Enforcement\n\nOne who has the power to punish others should not punish everyone. There are innumerable living entities, most of whom are in the spiritual world and arenitya-mukta,everlastingly liberated. There is no question of judging these liberated living beings. Only a small fraction of the living entities, perhaps one fourth, are in the material world. And the major portion of the living entities in the material world \u2013 8,000,000 of the 8,400,000 forms of life \u2013 are lower than human beings. They are not punishable, for under the laws of material nature they are automatically evolving. Human beings, who are advanced in consciousness, are responsible for their actions, but not all humans are punishable. Those engaged in advanced pious activities are beyond punishment. Only those who engage in sinful activities are punishable. Therefore the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas particularly inquired about the criteria Yamar\u0101ja uses to determine who is punishable and who is not. How is one to be judged? What is the basic principle of authority? These are the questions raised by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas.\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas felt that they were faultless because they were following the orders of Yamar\u0101ja, who himself is faultless. Just because a magistrate has to direct the punishment of those who transgress the law does not mean the magistrate is a criminal. He is a representative of the government. Similarly, although Yamar\u0101ja has jurisdiction over the regions of hell and deals with all sinful persons, he is a pure representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and simply executes the order of his master.\n\nA police constable is supposed to know the law and whom to arrest for breaking the law. If he arrests anyone and everyone, then he himself is a criminal. He may not arrest the law-abiding citizens. Similarly, the Yamad\u016btas cannot take away just anyone and everyone to the court of Yamar\u0101ja. They can take only the nondevotees to be punished for their sinful acts. Yamar\u0101ja has especially cautioned the Yamad\u016btas not to approach Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.\n\nHowever, because Aj\u0101mila had been very sinful, the Yamad\u016btas could not understand why he should not be considered a criminal and be brought to Yamar\u0101ja for punishment.\n\nDevotees and Demons\n\nThere are two classes of people in this material world: those who are servants of God, calleddevasorsuras, and those who are servants ofm\u0101y\u0101(illusion), calledasuras.\n\nIn the spiritual world, however, there is only one class, because the inhabitants are all servants of God. Therefore the spiritual world is called absolute. There is no disagreement in the spiritual world, as the center is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, and everyone there is engaged in His service out of love, not as a paid servant. A paid servant will serve in proportion to the money he receives, but in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha there is no question of being a paid servant. Everyone is liberated, and everyone is as opulent as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but everyone is still a servant. In the material world people serve out of need, but in the spiritual world everyone serves out of love. There is no need for anything, because everything there is complete. TheBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101says that in the spiritual world there arekalpa-v\u1e5bk\u1e63a,or desire trees, from which one can get anything he desires.\n\nIn the material world, service is forced upon everyone. If someone does not render service, he will starve. Even a king has to work, what to speak of the poor man. Under the direction of the Supreme Lord, the material energy makes everyone into a dancing dog. The master says, \u201cPlease dance,\u201d and the dog dances, because he knows that unless he performs, he will starve.\n\nWhether in the material world or the spiritual world, everyone is a servant, but here people are under the impression that they are masters. The head of the family thinks, \u201cI am the master of my wife and children.\u201d But in fact he is serving each and every member of his family. The state executive officer thinks, \u201cI am the king\u201d or \u201cI am the president,\u201d but actually he is the servant of the citizens. Servitude is his position, and unless he serves the citizens according to their expectations, he will be deposed or fail to win reelection.\n\nIn the material world everyone is trying to become master of all he surveys, and thus there is competition on every level \u2013 between self-acclaimed \u201cGods,\u201d between heads of state, even between friends and family members. In this illusory competition to be master, everyone fails. Mahatma Gandhi was respected as the father of India, but after all he was just a servant, and when one man didn\u2019t like his service, Gandhi was killed. Similarly, President Kennedy was a very popular president, but somebody saw some discrepancy in his service, and he was also killed. No one is really the master here. Everyone is either a servant ofm\u0101y\u0101(illusion) or a servant of God.\n\nEveryone has to obey the government laws. Under the spell of illusion, however, the criminal thinks, \u201cI do not accept the government laws.\u201d Yet when he is caught he is forced to obey the government laws in the prison house. He has no choice. Similarly, we are all servants of God, but the demoniac class of men (asuras)do not care about God and God\u2019s laws. These rascals think that there is no God, or that everyone is God, or that they themselves are God. But such \u201cGods\u201d must also follow the laws of God in the form of birth, death, disease, and old age.\n\nOnly persons who are totally illusioned refuse to serve God. Instead of voluntarily rendering service to God, they are the slaves ofm\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy of God. A person who is haunted by ghosts speaks all kinds of nonsense. Similarly, when a living entity is haunted bym\u0101y\u0101, or engrossed by the illusory effects of the material nature, he also talks foolish nonsense, and the most foolish talk is to claim that he is God.\n\nAmong the two classes of men \u2013 the divine (devas) and the demoniac (asuras) \u2013 there is an ongoing struggle. Theasurasare always rebelling against God, and thedevasare always surrendering to God. In the story of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, we see that even among family members there aredevasandasuras. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, was anasura, whereas Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was adeva. Naturally a father is affectionate toward his child, but because Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a demon, he became the enemy of his son. That is the nature of demons.\n\nOf course, even a tiger has affection for her cubs, and so at first Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu showed affection for Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was a very well mannered and attractive child at five years old. One day Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked his son, \u201cMy dear boy, what is the best thing you have learned in school? Tell me.\u201d\n\nPrahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja replied, \u201cOne should sacrifice everything to realize God. This human form of life is the best opportunity we have for making spiritual progress, and it must be utilized for realizing God.\u201d\n\nHira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu angrily inquired from his son\u2019s teachers, \u201cWhy have you taught all this nonsense to my boy?\u201d\n\nThey fearfully answered, \u201cSir, we did not teach these things to this boy. He is naturally inclined toward God, so what can we do? As soon as he gets the opportunity, he begins to teach God consciousness to the other boys in the class.\u201d In the absence of his teachers, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would immediately stand up on the bench and address his friends, \u201cMy dear boys, this life is not for enjoying sense gratification. It is for realizing God. Do not forget this.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, we have taken up this preaching mission because people in general are interested only in immediate sense gratification, which is not good for them. In the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(5.5.4)Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva says,n\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5bnoti:\u201cSimply for sense gratification people are committing so many sinful activities. They are just like madmen.\u201d A madman does not know what he is doing. Materialistic persons are so much engrossed in their pursuit of sense gratification that they have become maddened and commit all kinds of sins.\n\nLord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva says that the materialistic way of life is very risky. For those who indulge in sense gratification, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the facility, forcing them to take birth again in the material atmosphere. A monkey has very good facility for enjoying sex. In some ways a monkey is renounced: he lives naked in the forest, he eats only fruit. But his nature is that he must have at least three dozen wives for sex enjoyment. So-called renunciants who wear the cloth of as\u0101dhubut secretly enjoy illicit sex with women are just like monkeys. This is demoniac.\n\nDemons, orasuras, do not believe in God and act according to their own whims. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.15),K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a describes them as follows:\n\nna m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me.\u201d Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly states,\u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101h:because the demons have taken shelter of atheistic philosophy, they are the lowest of mankind despite their advancement of education, science, and politics. Someone might object, \u201cHow can you call an atheistic gentleman with a university degree a demon? He is so educated and highly qualified.\u201d The verdict of the\u015b\u0101strais that although he appears to be very learned, his actual knowledge has been stolen away bym\u0101y\u0101on account of his being atheistic.\n\nScriptural injunctions may not be very palatable; nonetheless, they are authoritative, and we have to preach the truth. We cannot play hide and seek with the problems of life. We must know our real position, and we must know what is religion and what is irreligion. Religion means action according to the orders of God, and irreligion means action that goes against the orders of God."

        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas replied, \u201cThat which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamar\u0101ja.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.40)\n\nHearing from Authority\n\nVedic principles are accepted as authoritative because they originate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus theVedascarry the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same way that law books carry the authority of the government.\n\nWhen it comes to determining what is religion and what is irreligion, there is no such thing as \u201cThis is my opinion\u201d or \u201cI think it means this.\u201d Opinion is nonsense. We have to understand God by the process of\u015bu\u015bruma, hearing from the authorized representative of God. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.1)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\nima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41proktav\u0101n aham avyayamvivasv\u0101n manave pr\u0101hamanur ik\u1e63v\u0101kave brav\u012bt\n\n\u201cI instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun god, Vivasv\u0101n, and Vivasv\u0101n instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.\u201d This is the way to understand theVedas:by hearing from the proper authority, the spiritual master.\n\nSo the Yamad\u016btas were claiming that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas should not hinder them in the performance of their duty since they were acting under the order of a bona fide authority, Yamar\u0101ja. Yamar\u0101ja is one of the twelvemah\u0101janas,great personalities who are authorities in both spiritual and material affairs. He is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but his thankless task is to punish all the souls who perform sinful activities. Just as the superintendent of police is a responsible, faithful servant of the government, so Yamar\u0101ja is a faithful servant of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His task is to chastise sinful persons. If a high court judge is required in ordinary government, why not in God\u2019s government?\n\nThere are twelvemah\u0101janasmentioned in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:Lord Brahm\u0101; N\u0101rada Muni; Lord \u015aiva; the four Kum\u0101ras; Lord Kapila, the son of Devah\u016bti; Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu; Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja; Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva; Janaka Mah\u0101r\u0101ja; \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b; Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja; and Yamar\u0101ja. These authorities know exactly who God is, and they can direct us to Him. Therefore the\u015b\u0101strasadvise us to follow them.\n\nWithout following themah\u0101janas,it is impossible to know God, because we cannot understand the path of religion by our mental speculation. Religious principles are enunciated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). Therefore real religion means to abide by the words of the Supreme Lord and His representatives. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.66)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cSimply surrender unto Me.\u201d That is true religion. Anything else is irreligion. Manmade religion is not religion; it is cheating. Nowadays it has become fashionable for everyone to manufacture his own religion without reference to the authorities. One should know thatdharma, or religion, means the laws given to man by God. The path ofdharmais strictly followed by themah\u0101janas, and so we have to follow them. Otherwise there is no possibility of understanding what religion is or who God is.\n\nEveryone in the material world is puzzled about what religion is. Therefore, theMu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad(1.2.12) says, one should approach a guru:tad vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet.\u201cIf someone wants to learn the transcendental science, he has to approach a guru.\u201d There are no exceptions. One cannot say, \u201cI shall learn the transcendental science without going to a spiritual master.\u201d No. That is not possible. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles enjoin,\u0101dau gurv-\u0101\u015brayam:the first step in understanding spiritual knowledge is to take shelter of a bona fide guru. And there are three principles to observe in taking shelter of a guru:tad viddhi pra\u1e47ip\u0101tena paripra\u015bnena sevay\u0101.We must surrender to the spiritual master, we must inquire from him, and we must render service to him. Then we will be able to understand real spiritual knowledge.\n\nWhen San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b approached Lord Caitanya to become His disciple, San\u0101tana surrendered himself and said, \u201cMy dear Lord, when I was a minister, people used to address me as a learned man, and so I accepted that I was learned and intelligent. But actually I am neither learned nor intelligent, because I do not know what I am. This is the result of my learning: I know everything except what I am and how to get out of this miserable material condition of life.\u201d\n\nWe see that modern education fails here also. The professor talks about so many things, but if we ask him what he is, he has no answer. Universities award degrees to the graduates, who think, \u201cI am a Ph.D., a very learned man,\u201d but if we ask that Ph.D. to explain what he is and what the purpose of life is, he will refer only to his bodily designations: \u201cI am American, I am male, etc.\u201d He can only state his identification with the body, which he is not, and therefore he is fool number one.\n\nAt first Arjuna was also thinking in terms of bodily connections: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, how can I fight? On the other side there are my cousins, my brothers, my uncles, my nephews, and my brothers-in-law. If I kill them, their wives will become widows and be polluted, and there will be unwanted children.\u201d Arjuna was a very learned man, but he was perplexed. He said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, now I am puzzled. I am ak\u1e63atriya, and it is my duty to fight, but I am deviating from this duty because I am bewildered and cannot reason clearly. I know You can explain to me what I should do; therefore I surrender unto You as Your disciple. Please instruct me.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01012.7)\n\nThe Vedic literature advises us first of all that the guru is not a plaything. One should not think, \u201cI must have a guru because it is fashionable, but there is no need to obey his order.\u201d That kind of guru is useless, and that kind of disciple is useless also. Accepting a guru is very serious. You must seriously find out who is a bona fide spiritual master, one who can solve the problems of your life. Only when one is serious about getting out of the blazing fire of material existence should one approach a spiritual master.\n\nThe\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(11.3.21)says,\n\ntasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyetajij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam\u015babde pare ca ni\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ta\u1e41brahma\u1e47y upa\u015bam\u0101\u015brayam\n\nOne who wants the ultimate benefit in his life must surrender to a guru. The guru must be well versed in the Vedic literature and know its conclusions. And not only must he be well versed in the scripture, but in his life he must have adopted the path of Vedic principles, without deviating in any way. He must be finished with all hankerings for wealth, women, and prestige, and he must be fully situated in spiritual life, completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should try to find such a personality and accept him as one\u2019s spiritual master.\n\nSo the servants of Yamar\u0101ja replied quite properly. They did not manufacture principles of religion or irreligion. Instead, they explained what they had heard from their spiritual master, Yamar\u0101ja.Mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25:one should follow themah\u0101jana, the authorized person. Yamar\u0101ja is one of twelve authorities. Therefore the servants of Yamar\u0101ja, the Yamad\u016btas, replied with perfect justification when they said\u015bu\u015bruma:\u201cWe have heard from our master, Yamar\u0101ja.\u201d"

        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas continued, \u201cThe supreme cause of all causes, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is situated in His abode in the spiritual world, but still He controls the entire cosmic manifestation according to the modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance.In this way all living entities are awarded different qualities, different names (such as br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, and vai\u015bya), different duties according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution, and different forms. Thus N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the cause of the entire cosmic manifestation.\n\n\u201dThe sun, fire, sky, air, demigods, moon, evening, day, night, directions, water, land, and the Supersoul Himself all witness the activities of the living entity. The candidates for punishment are those who are confirmed by these many witnesses to have deviated from their prescribed duties. Everyone engaged in fruitive activities is suitable to be subjected to punishment according to his sinful acts.\n\n\u201cO inhabitants of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, you are sinless, but those within this material world are all fruitive workers, whether acting piously or impiously. Both kinds of action are possible for them because they are contaminated by the three modes of nature and must act accordingly. One who has accepted a material body cannot be inactive, and sinful action is inevitable for one acting under the modes of material nature. Therefore all the living entities within this material world are punishable. Thus in proportion to the extent of one\u2019s religious or irreligious actions in this life, one must enjoy or suffer the corresponding reactions of his karma in the next.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.41\u201345)\n\nThe Cause Behind All Activities\n\nThe\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad(6.8) informs us,\n\nna tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyatena tat-sama\u015b c\u0101bhyadhika\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u015byatepar\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byatesv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca\n\nN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is almighty, omnipotent. He has multifarious energies, and therefore He is able to remain in His own abode and without endeavor supervise and manipulate the entire cosmic manifestation through the interaction of the three modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance.These interactions create different forms, bodies, activities, and changes, which all occur perfectly. Because the Lord is perfect, everything works as if He were directly supervising and taking part in it.\n\nAtheistic men, however, being covered by the three modes of material nature, cannot see that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the supreme cause behind all activities. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.13),\n\ntribhir gu\u1e47a-mayair bh\u0101vairebhi\u1e25 sarvam ida\u1e41 jagatmohita\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101tim\u0101m ebhya\u1e25 param avyayam\n\n\u201cDeluded by the three modes, the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.\u201d\n\nCompelled to Work\n\nThere are three energies of the Supreme Lord: the internal energy (par\u0101-\u015bakti), the marginal energy, and the external energy. The living entities belong to the marginal energy because they can come under the influence of either the internal or external energy of the Lord. By nature they also belong to thepar\u0101-\u015bakti, but when they come under the control of the material energy they are known ask\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a-\u015bakti, \u201cknowers of the material field.\u201d In other words, the direct, internal energy of God is spiritual (par\u0101), and the living entities have this same nature (par\u0101), but in contact with the material energy (k\u1e63etra), the living entity accepts a material body as his self and is thus forced to act, manipulating the five senses.\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas say that everyone with a material body must work. An ant and an elephant both have to work. The ant requires only a grain of sugar for his sustenance, whereas the elephant requires three hundred kilograms of food daily, but both must work for it. Foolish people say that the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not work, but the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day. They are not idle do-nothings. While we are in this material world, we have to work, but we work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is not really work, orkarma:it isdharma, practical religion. Unless one works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all his labor isadharma, irreligious sense gratification.\n\nOn the Basis of a Man\u2019s Nature\n\nThe real aim of life is to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, andvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharmais the institution of that ideal in human society. Thevar\u1e47\u0101\u015bramasystem divides society into four spiritual orders (\u0101\u015bramas) and four social classes (var\u1e47as). The spiritual orders are thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bs(celibate students), theg\u1e5bhasthas(householders living under spiritual regulation), thev\u0101naprasthas(retirees), and thesanny\u0101s\u012bs(renunciants). The four social orders are thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as(intellectuals), thek\u1e63atriyas(warriors and administrators), thevai\u015byas(farmers and businessmen), and the\u015b\u016bdras(manual laborers). Without the principles ofvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma,human society is almost animal society. Indeed, human civilization begins when human beings accept the four social and spiritual divisions of society, according to quality and work. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.13),c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25:\u201cI have created the four social divisions according to quality and work.\u201d\n\nIn this material world we associate with a particular combination of the modes of nature, and accordingly we mold our character and behavior, and by this criterion we fit into a particular social category. Today people say that there should be no more caste system, but how can they ignore the natural designation of classes in human society? There must be a class of intelligent men, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as, who are qualified to disseminate Vedic knowledge to the people in general. There must be a class ofk\u1e63atriyasto offer administrative rule and protection. There must be a class of merchants and farmers, thevai\u015byas, who trade and perform agricultural duties such as cow protection. And there must be a class of\u015b\u016bdras,who render service to the other classes. All men fit into these four classes, each according to hisgu\u1e47a, or nature.\n\nPrescribed Duty vs. Unlawful Action\n\nWhatever ourvar\u1e47aor\u0101\u015brama,however, the perfection of our work is to satisfy Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord states this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(3.9):\n\nyaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o \u2019nyatraloko \u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25tad-artha\u1e41 karma kaunteyamukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 sam\u0101cara\n\n\u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O Arjuna, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.\u201d This is the sum and substance of human life. Since we have to work, we should work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then we are saved from all sinful reactions.\n\nBut if we work for our personal sense gratification, we will become entangled in the reactions, lifetime after lifetime. It is not possible for a person to get out of the clutches of repeated birth and death as long as he continues to pursue sense gratification.\n\nCaitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says,j\u012bvera \u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2013 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era \u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019(Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya-l\u012bl\u010120.108): \u201cThe constitutional position of the living entity is that he is eternally a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d If one takes that position, he is saved; otherwise not.\n\nAnd how does one who accepts his position as a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a work? Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja explains in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(7.5.23):\n\n\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanamarcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam\n\n\u201cHearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia, and pastimes of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, remembering these, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one\u2019s best friend, and surrendering everything to Him \u2013 these are the nine processes of pure devotional service.\u201d\n\nIn order to take up these processes seriously, one must accept the regulative principles for spiritual life: no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, and no gambling. Then one will be able to accept the injunction to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantraand always be engaged in the service of the Lord in one of the above nine ways. If we accept this authority, our life will be successful, both spiritually and materially. Otherwise, we will have to be satisfied with indulging in sense gratification, performing sinful activities, suffering like dogs and hogs, and enduring repeated birth, old age, disease, and death.\n\nForgetfulness\n\nWe accept the body as our self, thinking, \u201cI am this body.\u201d However, we are not the body but rather the owner of the body, just as we are not our apartment but rather the owner or resident of the apartment. The soul is calleddeh\u012b, \u201cone who possesses a body.\u201d When we study our body, we say, \u201cThis is my hand, this is my leg.\u201d We do not say, \u201cI am this hand, I am this leg.\u201d Yet the illusion that we are the body persists. The body is nothing but a vehicle for the soul. Sometimes a new motorcar is wrecked in an accident, and the driver is overwhelmed with the sense of loss, forgetting that he is not the motorcar. That is the effect ofaha\u1e45k\u0101ra, false ego, or false conception of proprietorship.\n\nBecause we are covered by ignorance, we have forgotten what our previous body was. Even in this life we do not remember that we were once babies on the laps of our mothers. So many things have happened in our lifetime, but we do not remember them all. If we cannot even remember things that have happened in this life, how can we remember our last life?\n\nA person engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he did in his past life to get his present materially conditioned body, which is subjected to the threefold miseries \u2013 those produced by his own body and mind, those caused by other living entities, and those arising from natural disasters. As stated by Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(5.5.4),n\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47oti:a human being who is mad after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully.Na s\u0101dhu manye:this is not good.Yata \u0101tmano \u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25:because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which to suffer as he is suffering in his present body because of his past sinful activities.\n\nA person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance of what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present, and how he will suffer in the future. He is completely in darkness. Therefore the Vedic injunction istamasi m\u0101:\u201cDon\u2019t remain in darkness.\u201dJyotir gama:\u201cTry to go to the light.\u201d This light is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand when one is elevated to the mode of goodness or when one transcends the mode of goodness by engaging in devotional service to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord.\n\nKnowledge through Service\n\nHow service to the Lord and the spiritual master results in Vedic knowledge is described in the\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad(6.23):\n\nyasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25prak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\u201cUnto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed.\u201d TheVedasenjoin,tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet:one must approach a spiritual master who has full knowledge of theVedasand be directed by him in order to become a devotee of the Lord. Then the knowledge of theVedaswill be revealed. When the Vedic knowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of material nature.\n\nAccording to his association with the material modes of nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance \u2013 a living entity gets a particular type of body. The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness is a qualifiedbr\u0101hma\u1e47a. Such abr\u0101hma\u1e47aknows past, present, and future because he consults the Vedic literature and sees through the eyes of scripture (\u015b\u0101stra-cak\u1e63u\u1e25). He can understand what his past life was, why he is in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches ofm\u0101y\u0101and not accept another material body. This is all possible when one is situated in the mode of goodness. Generally, however, the living entities in this material world are engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance.\n\nOne who is in the mode of ignorance cannot know what his past life was or what his next life will be; he is simply interested in his present body. Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of life is immediate happiness \u2013 to eat and have sex. A human being must be educated to rise above this platform, to understand his past life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future. There is even a book, called theBh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,which reveals information about one\u2019s past, present, and future lives according to astrological calculations. Somehow or other one must be enlightened about his past, present, and future. One who is interested only in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in the mode of ignorance. His future is very, very dark. Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is covered by gross ignorance. Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance, and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or future."

        "chapter_title": "The Next Life: It\u2019s Up to Us",
        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas continued: \u201cO best of the demigods, we can see three different varieties of life, which are due to the contamination of the three modes of nature. The living entities are thus known as peaceful, restless, and foolish; as happy, unhappy, or in-between; or as religious, irreligious, and semireligious. We can deduce that in the next life these three kinds of material nature will similarly act. Just as springtime in the present indicates the nature of springtimes in the past and future, so this life of happiness, distress, or a mixture of both gives evidence concerning the religious and irreligious activities of one\u2019s past and future lives.\n\n\u201cThe omnipotent Yamar\u0101ja is as good as Lord Brahm\u0101, for while situated in his own abode and in everyone\u2019s heart like the Param\u0101tm\u0101, he mentally observes the past activities of a living entity and thus understands how the living entity will act in future lives. As a sleeping person acts according to the body manifested in his dreams and accepts it to be himself, so one identifies with his present body, which he acquired because of his past religious or irreligious actions, and is unable to know his past or future lives.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.46\u201349)\n\nBreaking Free of Past, Present, and Future Karma\n\nHere the Yamad\u016btas point out that the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature are visible in this life. For example, some people are very happy, some are very distressed, and some are in mixed happiness and distress. This is the result of past association with the modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance. Since these varieties are visible in this life, we may assume that the living entities, according to their association with the different modes of material nature, will be happy, distressed, or between the two in their next lives also. Therefore the best policy is to disassociate oneself from the three modes of material nature and be always transcendental to their contamination. This is possible only when one fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(14.26):\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 ca yo \u2019vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47abhakti-yogena sevatesa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate\n\n\u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Unless one is fully absorbed in the service of the Lord, one will be subjected to the contamination of the three modes of material nature and must therefore experience distress or mixed happiness and distress, depending on the severity of one\u2019s sinful activities.\n\nChanging Bodies\n\nThe Supreme Lord has appointed Yamar\u0101ja to decide the proper punishment for those who perform sinful activities. Thus at death each being is awarded a particular body in a particular place, according to his work. As Lord Kapila explains in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(3.31.1),\n\nkarma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47ajantur dehopapattayestriy\u0101\u1e25 pravi\u1e63ta udara\u1e41pu\u1e41so reta\u1e25-ka\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\n\n\u201cUnder the supervision of the Supreme Lord and according to the result of his work, the living entity, the soul, is made to enter the womb of a woman through the particle of male semen to assume a particular type of body.\u201d\n\nWe are changing our bodies every day, at every moment. It is called \u201cgrowth,\u201d but actually it is a change of body. Growing means leaving the old body and accepting a new body. After some years we can see that a child has grown to boyhood, then to youth. That means he has changed his body. Similarly, when we find that the body is no longer inhabitable, we have to give it up and accept another body, just as we have to give up our clothes when they become old and worn.\n\nThis change is executed under the supervision of higher authorities (daiva-netre\u1e47a). According to one\u2019s religious and irreligious acts, one has to accept a particular type of body in a particular position and suffer. Our sufferings are classified as\u0101dhibhautika, \u0101dhy\u0101tmika,and\u0101dhidaivika.\u0100dhy\u0101tmikamiseries are those caused by our own bodies and minds,\u0101dhibhautikamiseries are those inflicted by other living entities, and\u0101dhidaivikamiseries are those which are inflicted by higher authorities (devas) and which are completely beyond our control \u2013 such as earthquake, drought, flood, and famine. We cannot adjust these situations. In the same way, after death superior authorities will offer us a certain type of body, and we cannot say, \u201cOh no, sir, I do not want this body.\u201d We have to accept it.\n\nMinute Independence\n\nDue to repeated birth and death in so many material bodies, we have all forgotten that we are part and parcel of God, that we have an intimate relationship with Him, and that somehow or other we have fallen into this material world. It is very difficult to exactly pinpoint the origin of this forgetfulness. But even though we have forgotten Him since time immemorial, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so merciful that to remind us of our spiritual identity and our oneness with Him as His parts, He comes personally and teaches us what we have forgotten. And when He departs He leaves behind the scripture, especially theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,where He requests,sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cPlease give up all your nonsense and surrender unto Me. I shall give you all protection.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010118.66)\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father of all living entities. He is not happy that all these souls in the material world are rotting like hogs. Therefore He sends His representatives. In the case of Lord Jesus Christ, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sent His son. Lord Jesus claimed to be the son of God. Everyone is a son of God, but this son was an especially favorite son, and he was sent to a particular place to reclaim the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead.\n\nBut if the conditioned souls insist on staying here, what can K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His servant do? They allow us to go on with our materialistic activities, because the first condition for getting out of the material prison house is that we must desire to get out. When we finally become disgusted with our predicament, we pray, \u201cMy dear Lord, I have served lust, anger, and greed for so long, but they are still unsatisfied, and now I have become disgusted with serving them. Now, my dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, my intelligence is awakened, and I have come to You. Please engage me in Your service.\u201d\n\nThe living entity is the marginal energy (tata\u1e63\u1e6dha-\u015bakti) of the Lord, which means he can choose to be controlled by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inferior, material energy or His superior, spiritual energy. We devotees have chosen to come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In other words, we have agreed to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and submit to the protection of His internal, spiritual energy. Surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a begins with chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The wordHareindicates the devotional energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ameans \u201cthe all-attractive Supreme Personality of Godhead,\u201d andR\u0101mameans \u201cthe Supreme Enjoyer.\u201d\n\nBut there are many who will not come, because they do not agree to come under the control of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s spiritual energy. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not interfere. He says, \u201cYou may remain in the material world or come to Me \u2013 whatever you like.\u201d We have been given minute independence and the intelligence to discriminate between what to do and what not to do.\n\nWake Up!\n\nThe ear is the most important organ for learning what is to be done and what is not to be done for our ultimate benefit. We must hear from the superior authority. At night we sleep peacefully, unaware that someone might be coming to chop off our head. However, our sense of hearing is acute, even in the sleeping state. If someone cries out, \u201cWake up! Wake up! Someone is coming to kill you!\u201d we can be saved. Similarly, we are sleeping under the influence of material nature. We seem to be awake and acting, butprak\u1e5bti(material nature) is doing the acting \u2013 not us. We are being forced to act according to our association with the different modes of material nature. Although we are in the sleeping condition, our ear does not sleep, and it helps us to rise out of ignorance. If we hear from the right person \u2013 the spiritual master \u2013 and from the Vedic scriptures, we can awaken to our original, constitutional position as eternal servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The first prescription is\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41, hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we simply hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we will automatically wake up. The injunction of theVedasisutti\u1e63\u1e6dhata j\u0101grata pr\u0101pya var\u0101n nibodhata:\u201cWake up! Get up! Understand the great benediction you have in this human form of life. Now utilize it and get free from the clutches of the material modes of nature.\u201d In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.14)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains how to do this:\n\ndaiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012bmama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101m\u0101m eva ye prapadyantem\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te\n\n\u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered to Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d Surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. In the human form of life, that is our only business."

        "chapter_title": "The Realm of the Senses",
        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas continued: \u201cAbove the five senses of perception, the five working senses, and the five objects of the senses is the mind, which is the sixteenth element. Above the mind is the seventeenth element, the soul, the living being himself, who, in cooperation with the other sixteen, enjoys the material world alone. The living being experiences three kinds of situations, namely happy, distressful, and mixed.\n\n\u201dThe subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts \u2013 the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five working senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind. This subtle body is an effect of the three modes of material nature. It is composed of insurmountably strong desires, and therefore it causes the living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life, animal life, and life as a demigod. When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is certainly very jubilant, when he gets a human body he is always in lamentation, and when he gets the body of an animal he is always afraid. In all conditions, however, he is actually miserable. His miserable condition is called sa\u1e41s\u1e5bti, or transmigration in material life.\n\n\u201cThe foolish embodied living entity, inept at controlling his senses and mind, is forced to act according to the influence of the modes of material nature, even against his desires. He is like a silkworm that uses its own saliva to create a cocoon and then becomes trapped in it, with no possibility of getting out. The living entity traps himself in a network of his own fruitive activities and then can find no way to release himself. Thus he is always bewildered, and repeatedly he dies.\n\n\u201dNo living entity can remain unengaged, even for a moment. One must act by his natural tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this tendency forcibly makes him work in a particular way. The fruitive acts a living being performs, whether pious or impious, are the unseen cause for the fulfillment of his desires. This unseen cause is the root of the living entity\u2019s different bodies. Because of his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a particular family and receives a body like his mother\u2019s or father\u2019s body. Thus the gross and subtle bodies are created according to his desire.\n\n\u201cSince the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, this position can be overcome.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.50\u201355)\n\nThe Demands of the Senses\n\nThese verses describe how the living entity becomes entangled in the material body due to the interaction of the material modes of nature. Everyone engages in work with his hands, legs, and other senses just to achieve a certain goal according to his concocted ideas. In this way one tries to enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma, and touch, not knowing that the actual goal of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because of disobeying the Lord, the living entity is put into material conditions, and he then tries to improve his situation according to his whims, not caring to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself to instruct the bewildered living entity how to act obediently and then gradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal, peaceful life of bliss and knowledge.\n\nIn the material world the living entity has a body that is a very complicated combination of the material elements, and with this body he struggles alone, as indicated in verse 50 by the wordsekastu. For example, if one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone. Although many other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care of himself, because no one else will help him. Therefore this verse indicates that the seventeenth item, the soul, must work alone. Although he tries to create society, friendship, and love, ultimately no one can help him but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord. Therefore his only concern should be how to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 how to surrender to Him and evoke His mercy. That is also what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants. As He says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.66),sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cJust give up all kinds of concocted religion and surrender to Me.\u201d\n\nPeople bewildered by material conditions try to be united, but although they strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile. Everyone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of nature. Therefore one\u2019s only hope, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises, is to surrender to Him, for He can help one become free from the ocean of nescience. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore prayed:\n\nayi nanda-tanuja ki\u1e45kara\u1e41patita\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63ame bhav\u0101mbudhauk\u1e5bpay\u0101 tava p\u0101da-pa\u1e45kaja-sthita-dh\u016bl\u012b-sad\u1e5b\u015ba\u1e41 vicintaya\n\n\u201cO K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, beloved son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have fallen into this ocean of nescience, and although I am struggling very hard, there is no way I can save myself. If You kindly pick me up and fix me as one of the particles of dust at Your lotus feet, that will save me.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings,an\u0101di karama-phale, pa\u1e0di\u2019 bhav\u0101r\u1e47ava-jale, tarib\u0101re n\u0101 dekhi up\u0101ya:\u201cMy dear Lord, I cannot remember when I somehow or other fell into this ocean of nescience, and now I can find no way to rescue myself.\u201d We should remember that everyone is responsible for his own life. If an individual becomes a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is then delivered from the ocean of nescience. Thus his life becomes successful.\n\nPain and Pleasure\n\nActually, there is no pleasure in the material world; everything is painful. Everyone is trying to be happy by sensual activity, but the result is unhappiness and frustration. This is calledm\u0101y\u0101,illusion.\n\nLord Buddha understood the nature of material pleasure. In his youth he was a prince, enjoying great opulence and sensual pleasures, but he renounced it all. Sitting down in meditation, he stopped all sensual activities, which subject one to the pains and pleasures of this material world. He gave up his kingdom just to teach that sensual activities do not help us attain salvation. Salvation means to get out of the clutches of the pleasure and pain of this world.\n\nBuddhism is concerned largely with the predicament of the body. Due to the interactions of the three modes of material nature, which are acting on our material bodies, we experience various pains and pleasures. Buddhism teaches that one can be relieved of these pains and pleasures as soon as one dismantles the combination of the material elements in the shape of the physical body.Nirv\u0101\u1e47a,the goal of Buddhism, is the state attained when a person has finished with the material combinations. After all, pains and pleasures are due to possessing this material body. However, Buddhist philosophy does not provide information about the soul, the possessor of the body. Thus Buddhism is imperfect.\n\nBuddhist philosophy is incomplete, but that does not mean Lord Buddha did not know the complete truth. A teacher may have received his master\u2019s degree, yet he still teaches the ABC\u2019s to his students. It is not that his knowledge is limited to the ABC\u2019s. Similarly, any especially empowered incarnation (\u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ra) will preach God consciousness according to time, place, and circumstances. The teacher holds his master\u2019s degree, but the students may not be qualified to receive the high instructions that the teacher is competent to teach.\n\nTherefore there are different schools of religion, like Buddhism and \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. Both the Buddhists and the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs encourage their followers to try to get free of pain and pleasure, which are due to sensual activities. No genuine philosopher urges his followers to pursue sensual activities. Buddha finishes with matter: to achievenirv\u0101\u1e47aone must first dismantle the material combination of the body. In other words, the body is a combination of five material elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether, and this combination is the cause of all pain and pleasure; so when the combination is at last dismantled, there will be no more pain and pleasure.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s philosophy is to get out of this combination of material elements and become situated in our original, spiritual position. Thus the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs\u2019 motto isbrahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101:\u201cBrahman, the Absolute, is true, and this material creation is false.\u201d \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya rejected Buddha\u2019s philosophy, which gives no information concerning the spirit soul. Buddha\u2019s philosophy deals only with matter and the dissolution of matter; thus the goal of Buddhism is to merge into the voidness.\n\nBoth Buddhism and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy reveal only partial truth. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy accepts Brahman, spirit, but does not describe spirit in its fullness. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy teaches that as soon as we become cognizant of our existence as Brahman (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi), then all our activities come to a stop. But this is not a fact. The living entity is always active. It may seem that in meditation one can stop all sensual activity, but still one is meditating, and that is also action.\n\nWhile meditating on Brahman, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b thinks, \u201cI have become God.\u201d In one sense, of course, it is correct to think, \u201cI am one with God,\u201d for as spirit souls we are all one with God in quality. But no one can ever becomequantitativelyone with God. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(15.7)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares that the living entities are \u201cpart and parcel of Me.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is completely spiritual (sac-cid-\u0101nanda), so each particle of spirit must also besac-cid-\u0101nanda,just as a gold earring is qualitatively one with the gold in a gold mine. Still, the gold earring is not the gold mine.\n\nSo the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs\u2019 mistake is to think that the part can become equal to the whole. They presume that because they are part and parcel of God, theyareGod. Therefore the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(10.2.32)describes the impersonalists asavi\u015buddha-buddhaya\u1e25:\u201cTheir intelligence is impure; they are still in ignorance.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs believe that by accumulating knowledge they become one with God, and thus they address one another as \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d That is their great mistake. We cannot become Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a isvibhu,which means \u201cvery big\u201d or \u201cinfinite,\u201d whereas we area\u1e47u,infinitesimal. Our spiritual magnitude measures one ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair. Therefore how can any sane man claim that he has become God?\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya gave a hint about Brahman, teaching everyone to think,aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi,\u201cI am the spirit self, not the material body.\u201d TheVedasagree. One who is situated inmukti, or liberation, understands perfectly, \u201cI am not this body; I am pure spirit soul.\u201d But that is not the end of self-realization. Next one has to ask, \u201cIf I am an eternal spirit soul, what is my eternal spiritual activity?\u201d That eternal activity is devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nIn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.54)Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a describes how Brahman realization leads to devotional service:\n\nbrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63atisama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016btesumad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m\n\n\u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d\n\nOften big swamis talk about attaining \u201cBrahman realization\u201d but do not remove themselves from worldly pleasures and pains. They involve themselves in humanitarian activities, thinking, \u201cMy fellow countrymen are suffering; let me open a hospital\u201d or \u201cThey are uneducated; let me open a school.\u201dIf someone is really on the platform ofbrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25,why would he accept any particular place as his country? Actually, as spirit souls we do not belong to any country. We get a body, and as soon as the body is finished, the connection with a particular country is also finished. The symptom of lamentation reveals that the so-called liberated person has not been cured of his attachment to worldly pleasure and pain. That means he has not become joyful, because one who is joyful does not lament. So many learnedsanny\u0101s\u012bshave fallen down to material activities because they have not in fact realized Brahman. It is not so easy. As already explained, the influence of the modes of nature is very strong. The living entity entangled in different types of fruitive activity is like a silkworm trapped in a cocoon. Getting free is very difficult unless one is helped by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nSpiritual Senses\n\nReal knowledge is attained by applying the senses in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At present, our mind and senses are absorbed in bodily designations, such as \u201cI am American,\u201d \u201cI am Indian,\u201d or \u201cI am English.\u201d In this consciousness we think that we should apply our senses in the service of our relatives, our society, our nation, etc. But these are temporary circumstances. Our real position is that we are Brahman, pure spirit soul. As long as we think of ourselves as belonging to some temporary designation, we cannot become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nAs we have pointed out, Brahman realization is not the end of spiritual knowledge. There are three stages of self-realization: Brahman, or the realization that one is not this body but a spirit soul; Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization, or understanding the Lord within the heart; and Bhagav\u0101n realization, realizing the Lord in His personal form as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nBeyond Brahman is Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization, realizing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart as Supersoul. Brahman is like the sunlight, but Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is like seeing the sun globe itself, the source of the sun\u2019s rays. Going still further, one can enter into the spiritual planets of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is the ultimate stage of self-realization and is like meeting the sun god himself. The sunlight, the sun globe, and the sun god are one and inseparable, yet they are simultaneously different. The sunlight is the impersonal effulgence of the sun, the sun globe is its localized aspect, and the sun god is the personal source of both the sun globe and the sunlight. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.27)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms that He is the source of the Brahman effulgence:brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham.\u201cI am the basis of the impersonal Brahman.\u201d And in the\u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad(15) a devotee prays,\n\nhira\u1e47mayena p\u0101tre\u1e47asatyasy\u0101pihita\u1e41 mukhamtat tva\u1e41 p\u016b\u1e63ann ap\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e47usatya-dharm\u0101ya d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daye\n\n\u201cO my Lord, sustainer of all that lives, Your real face is covered by Your dazzling effulgence. Please remove that covering and exhibit Yourself to Your pure devotee.\u201d\n\nSo Brahman realization is not enough. A sick man\u2019s fever may go down, but he may not yet be cured. He is finally cured when he is not only safe from fever but fully recovered and back to his normal, active life. Otherwise there is danger of relapse. Likewise, understanding \u201cI am a spirit soul, not the body\u201d does not mean one is cured of illusion. Only when a person fully understands that he is the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and he acts on that understanding is he truly self-realized.\n\nA Special Concession for All People\n\nIn the present age, for all people the best path to achieve self-realization is to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The conditioned souls in this Age of Kali are so engrossed in sinful activities that it is impossible for them to follow the Vedic injunctions in a systematic way. The chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantrais the special concession of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself \u2013 who appeared five hundred years ago just to deliver the fallen souls by inaugurating thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanamovement, the movement of the congregational chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy names. Lord Caitanya would often quote the following verse from theB\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a(3.8.126):\n\nharer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\n\n\u201cIn this age the only way to attain salvation is to chant the holy name, chant the holy name, chant the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way, no other way, no other way.\u201d\n\nWe can see the power of chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by studying the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. In this movement all kinds of sinful activities are being given up by persons who have been addicted to bad habits ever since they were living in the wombs of their mothers. This is their good fortune. As \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says in theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta(Madhya-l\u012bl\u010119.151),\n\nbrahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bhramite kona bh\u0101gyav\u0101n j\u012bvaguru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja\n\n\u201cThe living entity is rotating in different lives and in different bodies, transmigrating from one situation to another throughout the universe, but if he is fortunate and gets the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will get a bona fide spiritual master, from whom he will receive the seed of the creeper ofbhakti,devotional service.\u201d If he is truly intelligent, he will sow that seed in his heart and water it. If you sow a seed in the earth, you must water it so that it will fructify. Similarly, once the seed ofbhaktihas been sown in the heart, it has to be watered properly. What is that water?\u015arava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam:hearing and chanting the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the watering process that will make the seed of devotional service grow.\n\nBy cultivating devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we can get out of our unfortunate position in the material world, which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has certified in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101asdu\u1e25kh\u0101layam,a place full of miseries. In other words, by taking shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the shape of chanting and hearing His holy name, we will not have to undergo repeated birth and death in this miserable material world.\n\nBody of Desire\n\nThe\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamdescribes in detail how a conditioned living entity takes birth. According to hiskarma,the living entity is put into the semen of a particular father, and the living entity\u2019s gross material body is manifested from the union of father and mother. During sexual intercourse, the mentalities of the father and mother are combined when the father\u2019s semen and mother\u2019s egg mix, and this combination is acquired by the child.\n\nEach of us has a different type of body: no one\u2019s body is identical to anyone else\u2019s. The different types of bodies have a cause, and that cause iskarma. According to one\u2019s previous activities, one develops a certain kind of subtle body \u2013 made up of mind, intelligence, and false ego \u2013 and on the basis of the subtle body one gets a particular gross body. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.6):\n\nya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41tyajaty ante kalevaramta\u1e41 tam evaiti kaunteyasad\u0101 tad-bh\u0101va-bh\u0101vita\u1e25\n\n\u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunt\u012b, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d The character of the subtle body at the time of death is determined by the sum total of one\u2019s activities during one\u2019s lifetime. If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at the time of death his subtle body will create a gross body in which he will be a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 or if he is still more advanced, he will not take another material body at all but will immediately get a spiritual body and thus return home, back to Godhead. This is the perfection of human life."

        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas continued: \u201cIn the beginning this br\u0101hma\u1e47a named Aj\u0101mila studied all the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of good character, good conduct, and good qualities. firmly established in executing all the Vedic injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control. Furthermore, he was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Aj\u0101mila was very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire god, guests, and the elders of his household. Indeed, he was free from false prestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved. He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.\n\n\u201dOnce Aj\u0101mila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers, and two kinds of grass, called samit and ku\u015ba. On the way home he came upon a lusty fourth-class man (\u015b\u016bdra) shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The \u015b\u016bdra was smiling, singing, and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the \u015b\u016bdra and the prostitute were drunk. The prostitute\u2019s eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in which Aj\u0101mila saw them.\n\n\u201cThe \u015b\u016bdra, his arm decorated with turmeric powder, was embracing the prostitute. When Aj\u0101mila saw her, the dormant lusty desires in his heart awakened, and in illusion he fell under their control. As far as possible he patiently tried to remember the instructions of the \u015b\u0101stras not even to see a woman. With the help of this knowledge and his intellect, he tried to control his lusty desires, but because of the force of Cupid within his heart, he failed to control his mind.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.56\u201362)\n\nBrahminical Qualifications\n\nThe order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, the Yamad\u016btas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety and how a living entity is entangled in this material world. Describing the history of Aj\u0101mila, the Yamad\u016btas relate that in the beginning he was a learned scholar of the Vedic literature. He was well behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone. In fact, he had all good qualities. In other words, he was a perfectbr\u0101hma\u1e47a. Abr\u0101hma\u1e47ais expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative principles, and to have all good qualities. The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses.\n\nApparently Aj\u0101mila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfectbrahmac\u0101r\u012band was very softhearted, truthful, clean, and pure. How he fell down in spite of all these qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamar\u0101ja is described here.\n\nBecause Aj\u0101mila was born into abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, he was naturally\u015bruta-sampanna.\u015arutameans that by hearing theVedas, Aj\u0101mila was rich in Vedic knowledge. In Indiabr\u0101hma\u1e47asare calledpa\u1e47\u1e0ditas,\u201clearned men.\u201d Abr\u0101hma\u1e47acannot be a fool and a rascal. Therefore one who has no knowledge of theVedascannot be abr\u0101hma\u1e47a. Simply reading theVedasfrom a scholastic viewpoint is useless. One must practically apply the knowledge of theVedas. Armchair Ved\u0101ntists smoke cigarettes while readingVed\u0101nta,but that kind of study is useless. We have seen many so-calledsanny\u0101s\u012bstalking onVed\u0101nta,smoking all the while. Aj\u0101mila was not that type. He was a scholar of Vedic literature, and he was very well behaved. Abr\u0101hma\u1e47amust study theVedasunder the guidance of a spiritual master, and after the purificatory process ofupan\u0101yana-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra,he becomesdvija,or twice-born. At that time the sacred thread is offered to such a person. This is the sign by which we can understand a person has formally accepted a spiritual master. It is a kind of badge.\n\nOne who is not twice-born is unqualified to understand theVedas.It is not that just because one happens to know a little Sanskrit he becomes expert in Vedic knowledge. Many foreign scholars have translated theVedas, but we do not accept their translations as bona fide, because a student of theVedasmust bedvija. When a person has become truthful, able to control his mind and senses, clean, simple and tolerant, full of knowledge, and able to practically apply knowledge in life, and when he has full faith in God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he isdvija. Such a person can be said to have become a duly qualifiedbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,and he is able to study and understand theVedas.\n\nAj\u0101mila was not only born in abr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily, but he was qualified in Vedic knowledge. In his youth he studied theVedascompletely. He was\u015b\u012blav\u0101n,\u201cvery gentle.\u201d He also practicedsad-\u0101c\u0101ra,which means he observed the habit of keeping clean and rising early in the morning to attend Vedic temple ceremonies, such asma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati.He was a reservoir of good qualities. We too can practicesad-\u0101c\u0101raif we perform devotional service regularly, including daily attendance atma\u1e45gala-\u0101ratiand chanting sixteen rounds of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra on beads. These practices will gradually cleanse us of material contamination.\n\nUpon accepting initiation from the spiritual master, one takes a vow to perform these spiritual activities daily. Even the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who were liberated personalities, regularly chanted themah\u0101-mantramany times daily, and they never failed to offer their obeisances to the Deity and the devotees. Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b would offer obeisances flat on the ground (da\u1e47\u1e0davats) many times daily. These activities indicate that the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs weredh\u1e5bta-vrata,accustomed to taking vows with great determination and carrying them out. Without practicing austerity and penance with firm determination, we cannot approach God. One who is serious about making spiritual advancement has to accept all these regulative principles.\n\nAj\u0101mila possessed all brahminical qualifications, and he knew all the necessary mantras, such as the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra and the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra.Also, he was always rendering service to his guru. That is the first qualification of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a. In Vedic times, every high-caste family performed a fire sacrifice in the morning after taking a bath and chanting Vedic mantras.Agni(the sacrificial fire) was continually lit. They offered oblations to the fire, to the guru, and then to all the adult members of the family. Thus they daily offered respect to their father and mother and to the spiritual master. Nowadays this is not done, but in the Vedic system this was the first business of the day.\n\nA good example of this practice of respecting elders is Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the great saintly P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava king. After the battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his four brothers would go every day to offer their respects to their paternal uncle, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra had contrived many plots to destroy the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, finally declaring war on them, but the result was that every one of his hundred sons died. Even after he lost the war, he still refused to welcome his nephews, the sons of his brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. This was a great insult to King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. One day Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s younger brother, Vidura, a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, went to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and said, \u201cMy dear brother, you are so shameless that first you declare war against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and now that you are an old man, still you do not receive King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira as your guest, yet you live in his house at his expense. Are you so shameless, my dear brother?\u201d Vidura spoke in this way just to help Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra break his attachment to family life. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was an old man, and all his sons were dead, but still he sat in his household arrangement, eating nicely prepared food. From this we can understand that family attachment is very strong. Vidura chastised Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra: \u201cYou are coughing up mucus because you are very old, and your liver is weak. You will die very soon, yet you are still sitting in your comfortable chair, just like a dog. Have you no more shame than a dog, which always sits waiting for his master to feed him?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing Vidura\u2019s harsh words, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s hard heart softened, and he replied,\u201cYes! My dear brother Vidura, please let me know what I should do.\u201d\n\nVidura said, \u201cCome with me immediately to the forest. For the remaining days of your life, just engage yourself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Come with me.\u201d So without telling anyone, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra left with Vidura, and G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s faithful wife, followed. Together they went to the forest to finish their life in meditation on the Lord.\n\nWhen King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira came to offer his obeisances in the morning and saw that his uncles were not there, he became anxious, considering that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was an old man. At that time the great sage N\u0101rada Muni appeared and informed him, \u201cDo not worry. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and his wife, G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, have been brought to the forest by your uncle Vidura.\u201d\n\nThis story from the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamillustrates the system of offering respects to the elderly members of the family. After the morning\u2019s duties are performed, next one must go and offer obeisances to the spiritual master and the elderly persons in the family. One must also offer respects to a guest. Usually we know when a certain guest is coming to our home and can make preparations beforehand, but sometimes it happens that someone comes unexpectedly, and he too must be received with respect. And when it comes to eating, the head of the family should feed the older members first, then his children and other members of the family. He will eat last, and before he eats his food he should stand in the road and call out, \u201cIf anyone is hungry, please come. I still have not taken my food, and you are welcome!\u201d Some remnants of food should be kept at home in anticipation of unexpected guests. The Vedic principle is that when someone comes and begs, \u201cSir, I am hungry,\u201d a man must give the hungry guest his own food even if he himself remains hungry. That is realg\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. I have seen that a young man will not smoke in the presence of an old man without permission, even if they are strangers. So a young man will show consideration even to an older stranger, what to speak of his father or elder brother. In Vedic society, any older man is offered respect. These principles are not hard and fast, but this is Vedic custom.\n\nThus Aj\u0101mila was trained in his youth to offer respect to the spiritual master and his elders. This is one of the symptoms ofsad-\u0101c\u0101ra. Gentleness is another symptom. In other words, he was friendly to all living beings. A realbr\u0101hma\u1e47ais the friend of everyone, even an ant.\n\nIn this regard there is a story about N\u0101rada Muni and a hunter. Once N\u0101rada Muni was passing through a forest near Prayag and saw that many animals were lying half-dead. Feeling compassion for the suffering creatures, he cried out, \u201cWho is the culprit who is killing these animals, leaving them to die in this way?\u201d\n\nThe barbaric hunter M\u1e5bg\u0101ri answered, \u201cDear sage, please let me do my business. If you have come here to beg for a deerskin, I shall give it to you.\u201d\n\nBut N\u0101rada said, \u201cI haven\u2019t come to beg anything from you, but to ask why you are only half-killing these animals. It is a great sin. It is better that you kill them outright.\u201d\n\nM\u1e5bg\u0101ri replied, \u201cMy father taught me to kill them like this. I did not know it is sinful.\u201d\n\nN\u0101rada said, \u201cYes, it is very sinful. You will have to suffer very much for it.\u201d\n\nThe hunter became thoughtful and asked, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\n\nN\u0101rada Muni advised him, \u201cGive up this nonsense business.\u201d\n\nM\u1e5bg\u0101ri protested, \u201cThen how shall I eat?\u201d\n\nBut N\u0101rada Muni said, \u201cI shall provide you with food.\u201d\n\nThe hunter agreed, \u201cAll right, if you give me food, I can give up this business.\u201d\n\nN\u0101rada Muni then requested M\u1e5bg\u0101ri to sit down on the bank of the Ganges and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before a sacredtulas\u012bplant. N\u0101rada Muni went to the nearby village and announced that a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava was now chanting nearby on the bank of the Ganges. Upon seeing M\u1e5bg\u0101ri sitting and chanting peacefully, the village people said to one another, \u201cHe has given up his hunting business and is chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d They began coming regularly to the bank of the Ganges to visit M\u1e5bg\u0101ri. Someone brought rice, someone broughtd\u0101l, and someone else brought fruit. The food began to pile up.\n\nThe hunter M\u1e5bg\u0101ri wondered, \u201cWhy is N\u0101rada Muni sending me so much food? I have only myself and my wife to maintain.\u201d Thus he began distributing the food. Chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and distributingpras\u0101damdaily, he became a perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. (This is the system introduced in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement \u2013 chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantraand distributingpras\u0101dam. In every temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we do this.)\n\nAfter some time, N\u0101rada Muni called upon his friend P\u0101rvata Muni and said, \u201cI have a very nice disciple who was a hunter. Let us go and see how he is doing.\u201d P\u0101rvata Muni agreed. When the two sages approached M\u1e5bg\u0101ri\u2019s house, they saw that he was jumping this way and that. Upon seeing N\u0101rada Muni, he prepared to offer obeisances at his feet, but before he did so he took the edge of hisdhot\u012band gently brushed away the ants crawling on the ground so as not to crush them. He had been jumping because he was trying to avoid stepping on the ants. This was the very man who a short time before had been tormenting all kinds of animals, yet now he was not prepared to kill even an ant. That is the nature of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.\n\nSo, Aj\u0101mila had this quality of gentleness, which is prominent inbr\u0101hma\u1e47as.Also, despite all his training, Aj\u0101mila was not proud. He was free ofaha\u1e45k\u0101ra,or false ego. The very wordaha\u1e45k\u0101rameans \u201cI am doing this, I am doing that, and therefore I have become so big.\u201d Aj\u0101mila was free of this attitude. Nor was he envious. In these degraded times, everyone is envious of one or more persons. Butbr\u0101hma\u1e47aslike Aj\u0101mila are free of this propensity. Only when one has acquired these brahminical qualities and is accustomed to brahminical habits can one expect to be liberated from material bondage.\n\nRuined by Sex Attraction\n\nUnfortunately, as related in these verses, Aj\u0101mila lost his brahminical status. Once, as a young man, Aj\u0101mila went to collect flowers and other articles for Deity worship. His father ordered him, \u201cBring all these things from the forest.\u201d While coming back, Aj\u0101mila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very frequently. In the present Age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world have become shameless. Long ago, when Aj\u0101mila saw the scene of the drunken\u015b\u016bdraand the prostitute, he was affected, although up until then he had been a perfectbrahmac\u0101r\u012b. Nowadays promiscuity is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position of abrahmac\u0101r\u012bstudent who sees such behavior. For such abrahmac\u0101r\u012bto remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles. Nevertheless, one who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness very seriously can withstand the provocation of sin.\n\nIn our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunken, half-naked woman embracing a drunken man is a very common sight, especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult. Nevertheless, if by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a a man adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will certainly protect him. Indeed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that His devotee is never vanquished (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati). Therefore all the disciples practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one\u2019s position is very dangerous.\n\nAj\u0101mila had vowed to follow the regulative principles of spiritual life. But as we see, even when one is highly qualified there is the chance of a fall. Seeing the low-class couple engaged in public sex proved to be his downfall. Everyone knows that a husband and wife have sexual intercourse, but this should be done privately. Sex in public is animalistic. Similarly, sex with many partners is illicit. Nowadays illicit sex is common throughout the world, especially in the Western countries. A young girl thinks, \u201cI will find a suitable man, attract him, and have sex, but I won\u2019t marry him right away. I will test this man, then that man. When I have found the one who makes me happy, then I will marry.\u201d This is the mentality of a prostitute. And similarly, the young boys are hunting for many sex partners. These are commonplace activities in Western countries, where the boys and girls receive no spiritual training.\n\nIn such a cat-and-dog society, there can be no peace. All the leaders talk about peace, and they meet in peace conferences, but there can be no peace from conferring and passing resolutions. There cannot be peace unless the whole social structure is reformed, and that can be done only by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is cultivated by good association, just as a degraded mentality is a result of bad association. As Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva says in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(5.5.2),mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimuktes tamo-dv\u0101ra\u1e41 yo\u1e63it\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e45gi-sa\u1e45gam: \u201cIf we want to open the door to liberation, we should engage ourselves in the service of themah\u0101tm\u0101s,the pure devotees, but if we want to open the door to hellish life, then we can associate with those who are very attached to women.\u201d The lusty people of today\u2019s so-called civilized society do not care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They do not care for their elderly family members. They indulge in sex in the street, on the beach, in the cinema. Sex is advertised constantly to attract the attention of the people. In this way materialistic atheists add fuel to the fire of lust, and people are going to hell.\n\nSo, Aj\u0101mila became degraded by seeing a low-class couple embracing. Because both the\u015b\u016bdraand the prostitute were drunk, their eyes were rolling, and the prostitute\u2019s clothes were loose. Nowadays it has become fashionable to wear revealing clothing, but this practice is abominable. It simply makes the body more attractive for sex indulgence. It is said that if one\u2019s body is smeared with turmeric, it increases the lusty desires of the opposite sex. The wordk\u0101ma-liptenaindicates that the\u015b\u016bdrawas decorated with turmeric smeared on his body. Because the\u015b\u016bdraand the prostitute were rascals, they were not ashamed. They exhibited themselves freely, not caring for public criticism. They were laughing, smiling, singing, and embracing, and the young Aj\u0101mila saw everything when he passed by on the road.\n\nIn modern times sexual affairs of this kind are regularly shown in the cinema, and thus it is not hard to guess what kind of character is forming in the young men and women of today. By seeing these activities only once, Aj\u0101mila fell down. In this way Aj\u0101mila\u2019s spiritual education and training were finished. He was stunned and bewildered. When Cupid attacks, all one\u2019s education, culture, and knowledge are lost. Therefore one has to avoid this free-mixing, lusty society. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita advises, \u201cAlways avoid associating with persons too attached to sense gratification. Rather, associate with those who are engaged in the devotional activities of spiritual life.\u201d For this reason boys are sent to thegurukula,the house of the bona fide spiritual master, who trains them in spiritual life from the age of five.\n\nUnless one is very strong in knowledge, patience, and proper bodily, mental, and intellectual behavior, controlling one\u2019s lusty desires is extremely difficult. Thus after seeing a man embracing a young woman and practically doing everything required for sex, even a fully qualifiedbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, as described above, could not control his lusty desires and restrain himself from pursuing them. Because of the force of materialistic life, to maintain self-control is extremely difficult unless one is specifically under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service."

        "chapter_title": "Aj\u0101mila Begins His Degraded Life",
        "chapter_text": "The Yamad\u016btas continued: \u201cIn the same way that the sun and moon are eclipsed by a low planet, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a Aj\u0101mila lost all his good sense. Thus he always thought of the prostitute, and within a short time he took her as a servant in his house and abandoned all the regulative principles of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\n\u201dAj\u0101mila began spending whatever money he had inherited from his father to satisfy the prostitute with various material presentations so that she would remain pleased with him. He gave up all his brahminical activities to satisfy her. Because his intelligence was pierced by her lustful glance, Aj\u0101mila engaged in sinful acts in her association. He even gave up the company of his extremely beautiful young wife, who came from a respectable br\u0101hma\u1e47a family.\n\n\u201cThis rascal Aj\u0101mila, although born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, lost his intelligence because of the prostitute\u2019s association, and thus he earned money somehow or other, regardless of whether properly or improperly, and used it to maintain her and her children. In this way he spent his long lifetime transgressing all the rules and regulations of the holy scripture, living extravagantly, and eating food prepared by a prostitute. Therefore he is full of sins. He is unclean and is addicted to forbidden activities.\n\n\u201dAj\u0101mila did not undergo atonement. Therefore because of his sinful life, we must take him into the presence of Yamar\u0101ja for punishment. There, according to the extent of his sinful acts, he will be punished and thus purified.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.1.63\u201368)\n\nWe must serve \u2026 but whom?\n\nAs mentioned before, Aj\u0101mila was trained as a properbr\u0101hma\u1e47afrom birth, and thus he was properly situated in service to his spiritual master, elders like his father, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But due to his association with a prostitute, he gave up his brahminical engagements and became a servant of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s illusory energy,m\u0101y\u0101.\n\nThere are two kinds of servants:m\u0101y\u0101\u2019sservants and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s servants. Every living entity is originally a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya Himself affirms this:j\u012bvera \u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era \u2018nitya d\u0101sa.\u2019 \u201cThe constitutional position of the living entity is to be an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya-l\u012bl\u010120.108) In this world, everyone is trying to be a master. Individually and collectively, everyone is trying to assert, \u201cI am the lord of all I survey.\u201d But this attitude is futile, because by nature everyone is a servant. Instead of becoming a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we have become the servant of our senses. In either case we are servants. Therefore, those who are really intelligent think, \u201cIf I have to work as a servant, why not be a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d Only the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee is sane, because he accepts his natural position as a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nWorship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the actual goal of Vedic civilization, but the so-called Ved\u0101ntists do not accept this. They divert their attention to the worship of demigods and advise that one may worship any of them. No! Even demons (asuras) sometimes worship demigods. R\u0101va\u1e47a was a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, but he was anasura. Similarly, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a great devotee of Lord Brahm\u0101, but he was also anasura. Anyone who is not a devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is anasura. That is the verdict of theVedas. Aj\u0101mila was abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,which means that he was a servant of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. In other words, he was a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.\n\nA Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is one who recognizes that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme proprietor and enjoyer, and that everyone else is His servant. Just as the master is the enjoyer of his entire establishment, so K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the enjoyer of everything and everyone in both the material and spiritual worlds. Actually, no one else is the enjoyer \u2013 no one else is in the position to enjoy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only enjoyer.\n\nWhen we forget our relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His eternal servitors, we become servants of our senses. Following the dictation of our senses, we enter into the darkest regions of illusion and are subjected to the punishment of Yamar\u0101ja. Sometimes our conscience forbids us, \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d but we surrender to our lust and greed, and thus we do it anyway. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is within our heart, also dictating \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d yet still we do it. This kind of service to our senses simply brings suffering. Since we must serve, why not serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Why should we serve our senses, which are never satisfied anyway? We should become servants of God; that is the perfection of life. Otherwise we shall be obliged to become servants of our senses and suffer.\n\nOne who becomes a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes agosv\u0101m\u012b,a master of his senses. The title \u201cGosv\u0101m\u012b\u201d indicates one who refuses to follow the dictations of his senses. Instead he follows the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b did. \u201cGosv\u0101m\u012b\u201d is not a caste title. Before becoming agosv\u0101m\u012b,R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b served the Mohammedan government as a minister and was consequently rejected by the Hindubr\u0101hma\u1e47asociety. But when he gave up the dictation of Nawab Hussain Shah to follow the dictation of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the Lord made him agosv\u0101m\u012b.\n\nAll genuinegosv\u0101m\u012bsare alsovair\u0101g\u012bs,renunciants. But if one is unable to be a realvair\u0101g\u012b,then he must become ag\u1e5bhastha(householder). It is not that one may pose himself as abrahmac\u0101r\u012bor asanny\u0101s\u012band at the same time indulge in illicit sex secretly. That is abominable. If a genuine householder practiceskarma-yoga,giving the results of his activities to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will eventually attain the platform of perfect renunciation. He should not desire to enjoy the fruits of his activities but should instead work as a matter of duty, thinking \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants this \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be satisfied by my doing this \u2013 and therefore I must do it.\u201d This is the right attitude for a devotee. Arjuna was unwilling to fight for his personal interest, but when he understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight, he took it as his duty: \u201cIt must be done. It does not matter whether I like it or not. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants it, and therefore I must do it.\u201d That is the attitude of a renounced devotee of the Lord.\n\nIn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.66)Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructs His disciple Arjuna, \u201cJust surrender unto Me, and I shall protect you from all sinful reactions.\u201d And Arjuna accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction with the wordskari\u1e63ye vacana\u1e41 tava:\u201cI will do as You say.\u201d(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u010118.73)If we follow Arjuna\u2019s example, we will be in direct contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and we will be able to surmount all difficulties in both our spiritual and material life. We hear the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via the unbroken chain of disciplic succession (guru-parampar\u0101). Acceptance of these instructions is called\u015bik\u1e63\u0101, or voluntarily following the instruction of the spiritual master. The independent nature of the living entity is that he does not want to follow the instructions of another living being, however pure. But when one voluntarily agrees to obey the orders of the spiritual master, one is following the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus one\u2019s life becomes perfect.\n\nIn the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(11.17.27) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\n\u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101nn\u0101vamanyeta karhicitna martya-buddhy\u0101s\u016byetasarva-deva-mayo guru\u1e25\n\n\u201cOne should know the\u0101c\u0101ryaas Myself and never disrespect him in any way. One should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the representative of all the demigods.\u201d Thinking the spiritual master an ordinary person and envying him are causes of a devotee\u2019s falling down. Devotional service requires training under the guidance of a spiritual master, and this guidance is received when one surrenders to the spiritual master, inquires from him, and renders service to him. But these are impossible for one who envies the spiritual master.\n\nRuined by a Prostitute \u2026 Saved by the Holy Name\n\nAj\u0101mila was trained as abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,but he lost his position as abr\u0101hma\u1e47aby associating with a prostitute, so much so that he forgot all his brahminical activities. Nevertheless, at the end of his life, by chanting the four syllables of the holy name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he was saved from the gravest danger of falling down. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(2.40),svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t:\u201cEven a little devotional service can save one from the greatest danger.\u201d Devotional service, which begins with chanting the holy name of the Lord, is so powerful that even if a person falls down from the exalted position of abr\u0101hma\u1e47athrough sexual indulgence, he can be saved from all calamities if he somehow or other chants the holy name of the Lord. This is the extraordinary power of the Lord\u2019s holy name. Therefore in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101it is advised that one not forget the chanting of the holy name even for a moment:satata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101\u1e41 yatanta\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25.\n\nThere are so many dangers in this material world that one may fall down from an exalted position at any time. Yet if one keeps himself always pure and steady by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra, he will be safe without a doubt. Aj\u0101mila did not do this, and therefore he lost all his brahminical qualities by the association of a prostitute.Especially mentioned here is the effect of eating food prepared by a prostitute. Food prepared by an unclean, sinful woman is extremely infectious. Aj\u0101mila ate such food, and therefore he became sinful.\n\nAlso mentioned here is Aj\u0101mila\u2019s misuse of his inheritance. Customarily everyone is eligible to inherit his father\u2019s property, and Aj\u0101mila also inherited the money of his father. But what did he do with the money? Instead of engaging the money in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he engaged it in the service of a prostitute. Therefore he was condemned. How did this happen? He was victimized by the prostitute\u2019s dangerous, lustful glance.\n\nA chaste and faithful wife will give birth to good sons, who will then offer oblations to their forefathers and thus deliver them if by chance they have fallen into a hellish condition. The very wordputra(\u201cson\u201d) means \u201cone who can deliver his forefathers from hell.\u201d \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu showed this by His example when He went to Gay\u0101 to offer oblations to His forefathers. Even today there is a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temple in Gay\u0101 where such oblations are offered at the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. There have been cases where one\u2019s father or mother took the body of a ghost at death, and after oblations were offered at the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at Gay\u0101, the father or mother was delivered. However, anyone who becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava offers oblations to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at every moment, and thus his forefathers are automatically delivered. If one son in the family becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he can deliver fourteen generations of ancestors and fourteen generations of yet unborn descendants. This is confirmed in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.\n\nAs sense control is the beginning of pious life, illicit sex is the beginning of sinful life. One should not engage in illicit sex, or sex for any reason except having a child with one\u2019s wife. Marriage is meant for begetting children, and in that sense it is a religious institution. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.11):dharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u k\u0101mo \u2019smi.\u201cI am sex that does not contradict religious principles.\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had a devotee named \u015aiv\u0101nanda Sena, who was a family man. \u015aiv\u0101nanda used to come with all the devotees every year to see Lord Caitanya in Pur\u012b, and he came together with his wife and children. Once he came to see the Lord, and his wife offered her respects. At that time she was pregnant, so Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advised \u015aiv\u0101nanda, \u201cThis time when you get your child, you should give him the name Param\u0101nanda d\u0101sa.\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu knew that pregnancy resulted from sex, but He did not condemn sex in this case, as it was conducted according to scriptural injunction.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the case of Junior Harid\u0101sa. He was asanny\u0101s\u012b,a renunciant, who was an intimate associate of the Lord. Once he merely desired sex and did not actually partake of it, and immediately Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature, could understand this. The Lord then asked His other associates not to allow Junior Harid\u0101sa to come before Him anymore. Sarvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya, and other intimate associates of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu requested, \u201cJunior Harid\u0101sa is Your eternal servant. Somehow or other he has committed this offense, but kindly excuse him.\u201d Still, Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was firm in this respect and immediately replied, \u201cIf you like Junior Harid\u0101sa so much, better you remain with him, and I will go away.\u201d From that moment, nobody ventured again to request Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to excuse Junior Harid\u0101sa. When Junior Harid\u0101sa became hopeless in his efforts to be excused by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, he went to Prayag and drowned himself in the confluence of the rivers Yamun\u0101 and Ganges. Although Lord Caitanya knew about this incident, after some time He inquired of His associates, \u201cWhere is Junior Harid\u0101sa now?\u201d\n\nThey replied, \u201cSir, You did not accept him, and so he has committed suicide.\u201d\n\nLord Caitanya said, \u201cYes, very good. This is very good.\u201d\n\nCaitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was sometimes harder than stone and sometimes softer than a flower. That is the behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015aiv\u0101nanda was a bona fideg\u1e5bhastha, obeying the rules and regulations of householder life, whereas Junior Harid\u0101sa merely desired sex, but because he was in the renounced order of life he was condemned. Asanny\u0101s\u012bgives up his family and takes a vow to abstain from sex, but if he again takes to sex he commits a very great sin.\n\nSo, Aj\u0101mila was victimized by illicit sex with a prostitute. There are many instances throughout the world in which even a purified person falls victim to attraction by a prostitute and spends all his money on her. Prostitute-hunting is so abominable that sex with a prostitute can ruin one\u2019s character, destroy one\u2019s exalted position, and plunder all one\u2019s money. Therefore illicit sex is strictly prohibited. One should be satisfied with his married wife, for even a slight deviation will create havoc. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousg\u1e5bhasthashould always remember this. He should always be satisfied with one wife and be peaceful simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Otherwise at any moment he may fall down from his good position, as exemplified by the case of Aj\u0101mila.\n\nConsidering the abominable character of Aj\u0101mila, the Yamad\u016btas were perplexed as to why the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had forbidden them to take such a man to Yamar\u0101ja for punishment. Since Aj\u0101mila had not undergone atonement for his sinful acts, the Yamad\u016btas thought he should be taken to Yamar\u0101ja to be purified. Punishment by Yamar\u0101ja is a process of purification for the most abominable sinful persons. Therefore the Yamad\u016btas requested the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas not to obstruct their taking Aj\u0101mila to Yamar\u0101ja."

        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: My dear king, the servants of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are always very expert in logic and argument. After hearing the statements of the Yamad\u016btas, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas replied as follows:\n\n\u201cAlas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where religion should be maintained! Indeed, those in charge of maintaining religious principles are needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.\n\n\u201cA king or government official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer, and protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamar\u0101ja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?\n\n\u201cThe mass of people follow the example of a leader and imitate his behavior. They accept as evidence whatever the leader accepts. People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master\u2019s protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted and deserves to be the object of a living entity\u2019s faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.2.1\u20136)\n\nLogic and Reason\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, like all genuine servants of God, understood everything according to logic and reason. The instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are not meaningless dogma. Religion often gives rise to dogmatism, but the author of\u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta,\u015ar\u012bla K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, urges us to try to understand Lord Caitanya and the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness according to logic. In other words, do not follow blindly, on the basis of sentiment alone. One who fails to apply logic can easily be misled by unscrupulous persons. For example, some so-called missionaries advertise that man can become God, and they attract millions of sentimental followers. But how is it possible? Where is there evidence of any man becoming God? This false propaganda is not at all logical. One should use his intelligence to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nHowever, once we have accepted the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and taken initiation from a bona fide spiritual master, we cannot argue with him. We cannot challenge. To do so would constitute an offense and a fall from spiritual principles.\n\nThe Duty of Governments\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas accused the Yamad\u016btas of violating religious principles by attempting to drag Aj\u0101mila to Yamar\u0101ja for punishment. Yamar\u0101ja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish the sinful. However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamar\u0101ja is contaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamar\u0101ja but throughout human society.\n\nUpholding religious principles is the duty of the king or government. Unfortunately, in the present age, Kali-yuga, people have lost their intelligence, so they cannot differentiate betweendharmaandadharma,religion and irreligion. The courts do not know whom to punish and whom not. For example, out of compassion for all the fallen souls, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas go out to preach the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, even though these Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord, they are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace. This age, Kali-yuga, is very bad. We can only take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas chastised the Yamad\u016btas for violating the principles of justice. Such corruption of the judicial system is very prominent in Kali-yuga. The judicial system is meant to provide for execution of justice, yet false witnesses and bribery make it difficult. With money, almost anyone can get a favorable judgment in court. If the justice system is corrupt, life becomes extremely troublesome. The government is supposed to offer the citizens protection, as parents do for their children. A small child is completely dependent on his father and mother, thinking with full faith, \u201cMy father is here, my mother is here \u2013 I am safe.\u201d But if the father and mother are corrupt, where is the protection for the child? Similarly, if the whole government is corrupt, where is the protection for the citizens?\n\nWhatever the heads of society do, people generally follow. The government or king is like a father to the citizens. A father will never tolerate the killing or injuring of his children. He will give up his own life trying to attack the person threatening his children. Yet today crime is rampant. The government spends billions of dollars, but the citizens have no security in their lives. The government is answerable to the citizens because it must protect and provide for them. If the government is incapable or corrupt, then what is the position of the citizens?\n\nThe king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for attaining self-realization, realization of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that they will gradually be elevated to the spiritual platform and realize their relationship with God. This principle was followed by kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, Lord R\u0101macandra, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.\n\nUnfortunately, today\u2019s government leaders are generally dishonest and irreligious, and thus all the affairs of the state suffer. In the name of democracy, rogues and thieves fool the innocent populace into electing them to the most important posts in the government. Recently this has been proven in America, and as a result the citizens condemned the President and dragged him down from his post. This is only one case out of many.\n\nIn Kali-yuga, people have no shelter. Due to corrupt government, they are uncertain of their lives and property. The mass of people should always feel secure because of the government\u2019s protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons. We saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims had been living together peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga.\n\nAnother symptom of Kali-yuga is the abominable practice of animal slaughter. In this age animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas like the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. Indeed, hellish conditions of extreme suffering await the sinful men responsible for such cruelty. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith, whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age are therefore described asmand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25. As a consequence of such sinfulness, men are condemned (mand\u0101\u1e25), their intelligence is unclear (sumanda-mataya\u1e25), they are unfortunate (manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101\u1e25), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (upadrut\u0101\u1e25). This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions.\n\nAlthough Aj\u0101mila was not punishable, the Yamad\u016btas were insisting on taking him away to Yamar\u0101ja for punishment. This wasadharma,contrary to religious principles. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas feared that if such irreligious acts were allowed, the management of human society would be spoiled. In modern times, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to introduce the right principles of management for human society, but unfortunately the governments of Kali-yuga do not properly support the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement because they do not appreciate its valuable service. The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is the right movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity\u2019s sinful condition."

        "chapter_text": "The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas continued: \u201cAj\u0101mila has already atoned for all his sinful actions. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Even though he did not chant purely, he chanted without offense, and therefore he is now pure and eligible for liberation.\n\n\u201cEven previously, while eating and at other times, Aj\u0101mila would call his son, saying, \u2018My dear N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, please come here.\u2019 Although calling the name of his son, he nevertheless uttered the four syllables n\u0101-r\u0101-ya-\u1e47a. Simply by chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in this way, he sufficiently atoned for the sinful reactions of millions of lives.\n\n\u201cThe chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the best process of atonement for one who steals gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or for a man who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for a man who murders his father, the king, or women, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, such sinful persons attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who then considers, \u2018Because this man has chanted My name, My duty is to give him protection.\u2019 \u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.2.7\u201310)\n\nAbsolute Absolution\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas charged that the Yamad\u016btas did not know whom to arrest and whom not to arrest. The Yamad\u016btas regularly arrest sinful persons, but in this case the Yamad\u016btas came to arrest Aj\u0101mila, who had been released from all sinful reactions simply by chanting \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a!\u201d The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas criticized the Yamad\u016btas, saying, \u201cYou do not know whom to punish and whom not to punish. Even though Aj\u0101mila committed so many sinful activities, he is now freed from the reactions to his sins. He has completely counteracted all those sins by chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Why are you now attempting to arrest this person as if he were a criminal? Although he had no intention of chanting the holy name, still he has chanted it, and therefore he is now free of sin.\u201d\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas had considered only the external situation of Aj\u0101mila. Since he was extremely sinful during his life, they thought he should be taken to Yamar\u0101ja. They did not know that he had become free from the reactions of all his sins. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas thus instructed them that because he had chanted the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of his death \u2013 and also throughout his life \u2013 he was freed from all sinful reactions. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes the following verses from the scriptures:\n\nn\u0101mno hi y\u0101vat\u012b \u015bakti\u1e25p\u0101pa-nirhara\u1e47e hare\u1e25t\u0101vat kartu\u1e41 na \u015baknotip\u0101taka\u1e41 p\u0101tak\u012b nara\u1e25\n\n\u201cSimply by chanting one holy name of Hari, a sinful man can counteract the reactions to more sins than he can commit.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\n\nava\u015ben\u0101pi yan-n\u0101mnik\u012brtite sarva-p\u0101takai\u1e25pum\u0101n vimucyate sadya\u1e25si\u1e41ha-trastair m\u1e5bgair iva\n\n\u201cIf one chants the holy name, even in a helpless condition or without desiring to do so, all of one\u2019s sinful reactions immediately depart, just as a lion\u2019s roar causes the small animals in the forest to flee in fear.\u201d (Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\n\nsak\u1e5bd ucc\u0101rita\u1e41 yenaharir ity ak\u1e63ara-dvayambaddha-parikaras tenamok\u1e63\u0101ya gamana\u1e41 prati\n\n\u201cA person who once chants the holy name of the Lord, consisting of the two syllablesha-ri, guarantees his path to liberation.\u201d (Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\n\nThese are some verses explaining why the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas stopped the Yamad\u016btas from taking Aj\u0101mila to Yamar\u0101ja.\n\nThere are different kinds of sins, one of which is stealing. Thieves and burglars are very sinful. Another sinful activity is drunkenness. Those who are addicted to intoxication and stealing are condemned by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. Other examples of sins are being unfaithful to one\u2019s friends, killing abr\u0101hma\u1e47aor Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, dishonoring one\u2019s spiritual master or teacher, killing a woman, killing a king, and killing a cow. These are among the worst sins. But the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas say that even though a person has committed many such sins, if he utters the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a even once, he at once becomes free from sinful reactions.\n\n\u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cChanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Lord Hari, not only counteracted all of Aj\u0101mila\u2019s sinful reactions, but it made him eligible to become liberated, and therefore at the time of death he was transferred to the spiritual world.\u201d Chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a counteracts all sins \u2013 more than one can possibly commit. Because Aj\u0101mila had chanted the holy name without offense, and because he chanted sincerely, he completely freed himself from all sinful reactions. This is why we are stressing the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so much. Pious activities, austerity, sacrifice \u2013 everything is done simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. There is no need of any other process of yoga, atonement, or austerity and penance. Simply by chanting without offense one achieves the results of all other ritualistic performances prescribed in theVedas.\n\nPreviously, when engaged in sinful activities to maintain his family, Aj\u0101mila chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, but he did so without offense. To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one\u2019s sinful activities, or to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (n\u0101mno bal\u0101d yasya hi p\u0101pa-buddhi\u1e25). But although Aj\u0101mila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to counteract them; he simply chanted the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to call his son. Therefore his chanting was effective. Because he chanted the holy name in this way, he had already vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives. The conclusion is that one who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offense is always pure. As confirmed in these verses, Aj\u0101mila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.\n\nFoolish persons say that one can chant any name, even a demigod\u2019s name, and get the same result as chanting the holy name of the Lord. This is M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs think that everyone is God; they say, \u201cThe demigods are God, I am God, you are God.\u201d Therefore they say one can chant any name and become liberated. In Bengal it is very popular to hold ak\u0101l\u012b-k\u012brtana. A party of people meet and chant, \u201cK\u0101l\u012b! K\u0101l\u012b! K\u0101l\u012b!\u201d or the names of so many so-calledavat\u0101ras. One rascal added his wife\u2019s name to the chanting, and his foolish followers accepted it. In this way M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers are leading their followers straight to hell. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore strongly warned against hearing from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, lest one\u2019s spiritual life be spoiled and the path of devotional service blocked. We should always remember this when there is any question of chanting other names. We should chant the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 no one else\u2019s name.\n\nThe scriptures advise us to chant only the name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are thousands of names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and in once sense K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are the same, yet the scriptures explain that chanting a thousand names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u gives the result of chanting the name R\u0101ma just once, and chanting R\u0101ma three times gives the result of chanting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once. In other words, one automatically gets all good results just by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nCaitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore recommends this chanting process, according to \u015b\u0101stric injunction:\n\nharer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\n\n\u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d (B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\n\nBy taking up this chanting process, we are immediately freed from all sinful reactions. Thus we begin our spiritual life. Without being freed from sinful life, there is no possibility of becoming a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.\n\nOffenses Against the Holy Name\n\nEven a devotee may sometimes commit some sinful activity, either unknowingly or due to past sinful behavior. But if he sincerely repents, thinking, \u201cI should not have done this, but I am so sinful that I have again committed this sin,\u201d the Supreme Lord will excuse him on the basis of his genuine repentance. However, if he intentionally commits sinful activities, expecting that the Lord will forgive him because he is chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is inexcusable.\n\nIf one commits sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, he commitsn\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha, or an offense against the holy name. Of the ten kinds of offenses, committing sins on the strength of chanting is the most serious. If after being freed from all sinful reactions by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one again commits the same sins, he is guilty of a grievous crime. For an ordinary man, that sinful activity may not be regarded so seriously, but for one who is chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is a dangerous offense, just as it is a serious crime for a government officer in a high post to take advantage of his position and accept a bribe. Such men are the most punishable criminals. If a policeman steals, his crime and subsequent punishment are greater than that of an ordinary man who steals. That is the law. Similarly, one who takes gross advantage of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, thinking, \u201cI am chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so even if I commit some sin I\u2019ll be excused,\u201d will not achieve the ultimate goal of chanting the holy name. He becomes entangled in a cycle: he is freed, then he again commits sin, then he is freed and again commits sin, freed and again commits sin. In this way he is never liberated.\n\nNevertheless, one should not think that one\u2019s sinful reactions will fail to be counteracted by the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One of the ten offenses against the holy name of the Lord is to think that the holy name cannot eradicate sinful reactions. Those who cultivate offenseless chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantrashould have firm faith in the words of the\u015b\u0101strathat declare the chanting of the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be supremely powerful. As the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas say here, \u201cThe chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the best process of atonement forall kinds of sinners.\u201d But very often the difficulty is that one will chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and again commit sin.\n\nThe Perfection of Chanting\n\nThe key to successful chanting, therefore, is to carefully avoid sin altogether. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra,a person is freed from all reactions to his previous sins, and if he avoids sinning again, he very quickly becomes an advanced devotee. His mind becomes fixed upon the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we regularly chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without offense, we shall remain free from all sinful reaction, and our attachment for the Supreme Lord in devotional service will increase.\n\nOnce there was an argument between \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa and an ignorant so-calledbr\u0101hma\u1e47aconcerning the power of the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In an assembly of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, \u201cNot only does a person become situated on the spiritual platform (brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25) by offenselessly chanting the holy names of the Lord, but his dormant love of Godhead manifests and he becomes liberated automatically.\u201d\n\nThebr\u0101hma\u1e47aprotested, \u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate the effects of chanting in this way. One becomes liberated only after performing many austerities and penances. But you say that simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes liberated. If that is not the case, I shall certainly cut off your nose.\u201d\n\nHarid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura replied, \u201cIf chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not produce liberation as a by-product, thenIshall cut off my nose.\u201d\n\nThe members of the assembly witnessing this argument became extremely agitated upon seeing the great offense thebr\u0101hma\u1e47ahad committed against Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, and they immediately expelled the offender. Shortly thereafter, thebr\u0101hma\u1e47acontracted leprosy, and his beautiful nose melted away. This incident is narrated in\u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta.\n\nThere are three stages of chanting the holy name: chanting with offense, chanting as a liberated person, and chanting with full love of God. These progressive stages of chanting are like the ripening of a mango. An unripe mango tastes sour, but when the fruit is fully ripened, it tastes very sweet. Initially we may be reluctant to chant, but when we become liberated the chanting is so sweet that we cannot give it up. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has composed a beautiful verse describing the sweetness of the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a:\n\ntu\u1e47\u1e0de t\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davin\u012b rati\u1e41 vitanute tu\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101val\u012b-labdhayekar\u1e47a-kroda-ka\u1e0dambin\u012b gha\u1e6dayate kar\u1e47\u0101rbudebhya\u1e25 sp\u1e5bh\u0101mceta\u1e25-pr\u0101\u1e45ga\u1e47a-sa\u1e45gin\u012b vijayate sarvendriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u1e5bti\u1e41no j\u0101ne janit\u0101 kiyadbhir am\u1e5btai\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47eti var\u1e47a-dvay\u012b\n\n\u201cI do not know how much nectar the two syllablesK\u1e5b\u1e63-\u1e47ahave produced. When we chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it appears to dance within the mouth, and we then desire many, many mouths. When the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enters the holes of the ears, we desire many millions of ears. And when the holy name dances in the courtyard of the heart, it conquers the activities of the mind, and therefore all the senses become inert.\u201d\n\nThese are the symptoms of one who is on the liberated platform of chanting. At that stage, calledprema, one has a great relish for chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. But this stage is attainable only if one follows the regulative principles. We have to be cautious. After being cured of a diseased condition, we first enter the convalescent stage. If we do something wrong, the disease may return. It is not that we become liberated and can do anything and everything. At all times we have to stick by the regulative principles of devotional life.\n\nAccumulated Benefits from Chanting the Holy Name\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura provides additional insight into the power of the holy name in his commentary to verses 9 and 10. He writes this commentary in the form a dialogue concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord:\n\n\u201cSomeone may say, \u2018It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if a person commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?\u2019 \u201d\n\nVi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura replies by quoting verses 9 and 10 of this: \u201c \u2018The chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the best process of atonement for one who steals gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,or for a person who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for a person who murders his father, the king, or women, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, such sinful persons attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who then considers, \u201dBecause this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOne may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, and this is beyond ordinary atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the\u015b\u0101strasit is said that if a person only once chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b. Thus when Aj\u0101mila was in great danger of being carried off by the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, the Lord immediately sent His personal order-carriers to protect him, and because Aj\u0101mila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas spoke on his behalf.\n\n\u201cAj\u0101mila had named his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful, because the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is not different from Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. When Aj\u0101mila named his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, all the reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\u201cOne may argue, \u2018Since Aj\u0101mila was constantly chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?\u2019 By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that only his chanting of the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death \u2013 and not his chanting during his lifetime \u2013 was the cause of his being freed. However, his chanting during his life would then have been an\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha.N\u0101mno bal\u0101d yasya hi p\u0101pa-buddhi\u1e25:one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is an\u0101ma-apar\u0101dh\u012b,an offender to the holy name.\n\n\u201cIn response it may be said that Aj\u0101mila\u2019s chanting throughout his life was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with the purpose of counteracting his sins. He was in so much illusion that he did not realize he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his chanting of the holy name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a was neutralizing them. Thus during his life he did not commit an\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha,and his repeated chanting of the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a while calling his son may be called pure chanting.\n\n\u201cBecause of this pure chanting, Aj\u0101mila unconsciously accumulated the results ofbhakti,devotional service. Indeed, even his first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly, Aj\u0101mila\u2019s devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions did not affect him. In the\u015b\u0101strasit is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present, or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent\u2019s future victims from poisonous effects, even if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.\u201d"

        "chapter_title": "Awakening Love of God",
        "chapter_text": "The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas continued: \u201cBy following the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or undergoing atonement, sinful men do not become as purified as by once chanting the holy name of Lord Hari. Although ritualistic atonement may free one from sinful reactions, it does not awaken devotional service, unlike the chanting of the Lord\u2019s names, which reminds one of the Lord\u2019s fame, qualities, attributes, pastimes, and paraphernalia.\n\n\u201cThe ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one\u2019s mind again runs toward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, or glorification of the name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting completely eradicates the dirt from one\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cAt the time of death, Aj\u0101mila helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. That chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life. Therefore, O servants of Yamar\u0101ja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish conditions.\n\n\u201cOne who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the reactions of unlimited sins, even if he chants the holy name jokingly, for musical entertainment, neglectfully, or even to indicate something else. This is accepted by all learned scholars of the scriptures.\n\n\u201cIf a person somehow or other chants the holy name of Hari while dying because of an accident, such as falling from the top of a house, slipping and suffering broken bones while traveling on the road, being bitten by a snake, being afflicted with pain and high fever, or being injured by a weapon, he is immediately absolved from having to enter hellish life, even if he was sinful throughout his life.\n\n\u201cLearned scholars and sages have carefully ascertained that one should atone for the heaviest sins by undergoing a heavy process of atonement and one should atone for lighter sins by undergoing lighter atonement. But chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra vanquishes all the effects of sinful activities, regardless of whether heavy or light.\n\n\u201cAlthough one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows, and other such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one\u2019s heart. However, one who serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead is immediately freed from all such contaminations.\n\n\u201cAs a fire burns dry grass to ashes, so the holy name of the Lord, whether chanted knowingly or unknowingly, unfailingly burns to ashes all the reactions of one\u2019s sinful activities.\n\n\u201cEven if a person is unaware of the potency of a certain medicine, if he takes that medicine or is forced to take it, it will act even without his knowledge, for its potency does not depend on the patient\u2019s understanding. Similarly, even though one does not know the value of chanting the holy name of the Lord, if one chants the holy name \u2013 knowingly or unknowingly \u2013 the chanting will be very effective.\u201d\n\n\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued speaking to King Par\u012bk\u1e63it: My dear king, having thus perfectly judged the principles of devotional service with reasoning and arguments, the order-carriers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u released the br\u0101hma\u1e47a Aj\u0101mila from the bondage of the Yamad\u016btas and saved him from imminent death. Then the Yamad\u016btas went to Yamar\u0101ja and explained to him everything that had happened.\n\nThe br\u0101hma\u1e47a Aj\u0101mila was now free from fear, having been released from the nooses of Yamar\u0101ja\u2019s servants. Coming to his senses, he immediately offered obeisances to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas by bowing his head at their lotus feet. He was extremely pleased by their presence, for he had seen them save his life from the hands of the servants of Yamar\u0101ja. But when the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas saw that Aj\u0101mila was attempting to say something, they suddenly disappeared from his presence. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.2.11\u201323)\n\nAtonement vs. Chanting the Holy Name\n\nHere the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas say that the Vedic scriptures recommend various means of atonement, by which a person may be delivered from the reactions of his sinful activities. In Christianity there is also a means of atonement. If a Catholic commits a sin, for example, he is instructed to go to a priest and confess: \u201cI have committed such-and-such sin.\u201d The priest is supposed to be an authorized representative of God, and so if he excuses the sinner, the sin becomes nullified.\n\nHowever, such atonement cannot purify the sinful man as much as the purifying process of chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The man who confesses to having sinned leaves the church and often commits the same sin again. In other words, there is no question of becoming purified by this process of atonement.\n\nStill, atonement of various kinds is recommended in theVedasfor those who are not ready to take up the process of pure devotional service. These methods of atonement are proportional to the the severity of the sin they are meant to counteract. For example, if we fall sick with a cough or influenza, the cost of medicine prescribed by the doctor may be little, but if we are stricken with tuberculosis, the medicine will be more costly. Likewise,pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta,or the ritualistic ceremonies for counteracting sinful activities, is proportionately less or greater according to the gravity of the sin. If we commit a grievous sin, then the penance will be severe. These are the prescriptions given by great sages like Par\u0101\u015bara Muni and Manu. The sages have composed twenty kinds of scriptures, constituting thedharma-\u015b\u0101stra,and these scriptures are meant for atoning for one\u2019s sins and elevating one to the heavenly planets. For example, it is said that if one has committed certain crimes, he must vow to fast for a certain number of days or give charity. Or, a businessman who has earned a million dollars by sinful activities must give in charity accordingly.\n\nThere are many such prescribed methods of atonement, but here the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas say, \u201cAlthough these prescribed methods of atonement are authorized and true, they cannot purify the heart.\u201d We can see that even though the adherents of Hinduism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity perform such rituals of atonement, they cannot refrain from again committing the same sins. One who practices these principles of atonement is like a rascal patient who goes to a physician for treatment. The physician gives him medicine and instructs him how to take it, but the foolish patient takes the medicine according to his own whims, and so his condition worsens. Again he goes to the physician, crying \u201cDoctor, please give me more medicine.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes an incident that took place when S\u0101mba, one of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sons, was rescued from the punishment of the Kauravas. S\u0101mba fell in love with Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101, the daughter of Duryodhana, and since according tok\u1e63atriyacustom one is not offered ak\u1e63atriya\u2019sdaughter unless he displays his chivalrous valor, S\u0101mba abducted her. Consequently S\u0101mba was arrested by the Kauravas. Later, when Lord Balar\u0101ma came to rescue him, there was an argument about S\u0101mba\u2019s release. Since the argument was not settled, Balar\u0101ma showed His power in such a way that all of Hastin\u0101pura trembled and would have been vanquished as if by a great earthquake. Then the matter was settled, and S\u0101mba married Duryodhana\u2019s daughter. The purport is that one should take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, whose protective power is so great that it cannot be equaled in the material world. However powerful the reactions of one\u2019s sins, they will immediately be vanquished if one chants the name of Hari, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Balar\u0101ma, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nTherefore such rituals of atonement as fasting and giving charity are not accepted by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. They say, \u201cSuch prescribed ritualistic ceremonies cannot purify a man as effectively as chanting the holy name of God.\u201d Undoubtedly one becomes free from all contamination of sinful life by executing particular religious principles, but these are ultimately insufficient, because the mind is so disturbed that even after being freed from the contamination of sinful reactions, the mind again becomes attracted to sinful activity.\n\nThe purificatory power of devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, beginning with the chanting of the holy name, is stated in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(11.2.42):bhakti\u1e25 pare\u015b\u0101nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca.\u201cDevotional service to the Lord is so powerful that one who performs it is immediately freed from all material desires.\u201d All desires within this material world are sinful because material desire means sense gratification, which always involves action that is more or less sinful. But pure devotional service isany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya,free from material desires. One who is situated in devotional service no longer has material desires, and thus he is beyond sinful life. Material desires should be completely stopped. Otherwise, although one\u2019s austerities, penances, and charity may free one from sin for the time being, one\u2019s desires will reappear because his heart is impure. Thus he will act sinfully and suffer. The special advantage of devotional service is that it frees one of all material desires.\n\nOne cannot purify one\u2019s heart by atonement alone. A patient suffering from syphilis goes to the doctor, who gives him an injection and charges a high fee. Yes, he may be cured, but when he again engages in illicit sex, he once again contracts syphilis. So his heart was not purified of the desire for illicit sex. But if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he forgets illicit sex. That is the test of one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A sincere devotee never commits sin, because his heart has become purified by chanting the holy name and engaging in devotional service.\n\nOf course, there are pseudodevotees who commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are great offenders against the holy name. We should not use the holy name like a machine, thinking that because the chanting process consumes sinful reactions we can freely commit more sin. This is the greatest offense against the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whatever sins we may have previously committed are immediately eradicated by offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord, even just once. But we must not sin again. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu forgave the sinful Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i, who had been drunkards, woman-hunters, meat-eaters, and gamblers. But these two sinners fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu and cried, \u201cSirs! We are so sinful! Kindly deliver us.\u201d Lord Caitanya agreed on the condition that they promise not to commit any more sins. He said, \u201cWhatever you have done I shall excuse, but do not do it again.\u201d Thus Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i vowed, \u201cThis is the end of our sinful activities. We shall not do them anymore.\u201d When a person is initiated by a spiritual master, the reactions of his sins immediately become nullified. But that does not mean he can again commit sins.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, and so we initiate disciples according to the principle he showed in the case of Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i. We accept many people into our Society as duly initiated disciples, but only if they vow to observe these regulations: no more illicit sex, no more gambling, no more intoxication, and no more animal-killing or meat-eating. These regulations are necessary, because if one takes up spiritual life and at the same time goes on committing sinful activities, he will never be able to make progress. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.28),\n\nye\u1e63\u0101m tv anta-gata\u1e41 p\u0101pa\u1e41jan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101mte dvandva-moha-nirmukt\u0101bhajante m\u0101\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d\n\nIf we are actually serious about entering into the kingdom of God, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, then we should be very careful to follow the four regulative principles mentioned above. One must not have any sex except to have children within marriage. One must not indulge in intoxication. One must not gamble. And one must not eat meat, fish, or eggs or anything else beyond the foods established for human beings \u2013 grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, and sugar. Such foodstuffs ares\u0101ttvika, or pure and good, and they are allotted for human consumption. One should not imitate the cats and dogs, reasoning that because the animals are eating meat, human beings can do likewise. If everything eatable is food, why not eat stool? Stool is also food \u2013 hogs eat stool. But human beings should not eat like hogs, who will eat all kinds of unclean foods. We have to discriminate. If we want to enter into spiritual life, we must observe these four principles of restriction. This may mean undergoing some austerity, but this is the purpose of human life. When we have purified our existence through austerity, we will be eligible to enter into the kingdom of God, but without being purified, we can never enter.\n\nMeditation on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s Form\n\nIf one chants the holy name of God \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 eventually he will see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, realize K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s qualities, and remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes. That is the effect of the pure chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that the chanting of the holy name of the Lord has special significance that distinguishes it from the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement for severe, more severe, or most severe sins. There are twenty types of religious scriptures calleddharma-\u015b\u0101stras,beginning with theManu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101andPar\u0101\u015bara-sa\u1e41hit\u0101,but herein it is stressed that although one may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord. On the other hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of the greatest sins, but also begins to raise one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one serves the Lord by remembering His form, attributes, and pastimes.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b explains that it is because of the Lord\u2019s omnipotence that this is all possible simply by chanting His holy name. What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can easily be achieved through the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name. To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy, sublime, and effective that one can readily achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu declares,para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam:\u201cAll glories to the congregational chanting of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name!\u201d Thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanamovement we have started offers the best process for immediately becoming purified of all sinful reactions and coming to the platform of spiritual life.\n\nAlthough Aj\u0101mila became fallen in his later days, in his youth he was abrahmac\u0101r\u012band was properly trained by his father. He knew the name, form, and pastimes of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, but by bad association he forgot them. However, as soon as he chanted the name of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a on his deathbed, he again remembered all his past pious activities, and therefore he was saved.\n\nThat chanting and hearing the Lord\u2019s name and glories is the best means of purifying the heart of sinful propensities is confirmed at the beginning of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.2.17):\n\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25h\u1e5bdy anta\u1e25 stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47ividhunoti suh\u1e5bt sat\u0101m\n\n\u201c\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d\n\nIt is the special mercy of the Supreme Lord that as soon as He sees a person glorifying His name, form, and pastimes, He personally cleanses the dirt from that person\u2019s heart. Even if one does not understand the meaning of the Lord\u2019s name, form, and pastimes, one is purified simply by hearing or chanting them.\n\nOne\u2019s main purpose in human life should be to purify one\u2019s existence and achieve liberation. As long as one has a material body, one is understood to be impure. In such an impure, material condition, one cannot enjoy a truly blissful life, although everyone seeks it. Therefore everyone requires purification. As Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva says in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(5.5.1),tapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101 yena sattva\u1e41 \u015buddhyed yasm\u0101d brahma-saukhya\u1e41 tv anantam:\u201cMy dear sons, you must performtapasya, austerity, to purify your existence; then you will come to the spiritual platform and enjoy unending spiritual happiness.\u201d Thetapasyaof chanting and glorifying the name, form, and pastimes of the Lord is a very easy purifying process by which everyone can become happy. Therefore everyone who desires the ultimate cleansing of his heart must adopt this process. Other processes, such askarma,j\u00f1\u0101na,and yoga, cannot cleanse the heart absolutely.\n\nM\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, or impersonalists, cannot glorify the name, form, and pastimes of the Lord because they think that God has no form and that His pastimes arem\u0101y\u0101,illusory. Why should God not have a form? We have a form because our father has a form. So why should the supreme father not have a form? In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(14.4) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101:\u201cI am the seed-giving father of all beings.\u201d The Christians also believe that God is the supreme father. If the sons all have forms, how is it that the father has no form? We cannot be born of a father who is formless.\u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25:\u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller and the cause of all causes, and He possesses an eternal form of knowledge and bliss.\u201d (Bs. 5.1)Vigrahameans \u201cform.\u201d If God is the cause of all causes, the creator, and He is creating all these forms, how can He be formless?\n\nGod has a form, but it is not a form like ours. His form issac-cid-\u0101nanda,but ours is just the opposite. God\u2019s form issat,eternally existing, while man\u2019s form isasat,temporary. God\u2019s form iscit,full of knowledge, but ours isacit,full of ignorance. And His form is full of\u0101nanda,bliss, but ours is full ofnir\u0101nanda,misery. It is only because we cannot conceive of a form so different from ours that sometimes it is said God isnir\u0101k\u0101ra, without form.\n\nGod\u2019s form is transcendental. That means His body is not material but spiritual. His form is of a different nature than that to which we are accustomed. In theVedasit is said that God sees but that He has no eyes. This means that God\u2019s eyes are unlike ours \u2013 they are spiritual, not material. We can see only so far, whereas God can see everything because He has eyes everywhere. His eyes, His form, His hands and legs are of a different nature than ours.\n\nUnlike our knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s knowledge is unlimited. As He says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.26), \u201cI know past, present, future \u2013 everything.\u201d Earlier(Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u01014.5)He reminds Arjuna, \u201cBoth you and I have taken many births. I remember them all, but you have forgotten them.\u201d Thus there is no limit to His knowledge. His knowledge, His body, and His happiness are completely different from our knowledge, body, and happiness. Therefore it is only out of ignorance that some people say the Absolute Truth isnir\u0101k\u0101ra,formless.\n\nThinking that God has no form is just imagination. It is material thought. We have a form, so He must have a form, though not a form like ours. Only fools think God is ultimately formless. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.24):avyakta\u1e41 vyaktim \u0101panna\u1e41 manyante m\u0101m abuddhaya\u1e25.\u201cUnintelligent men think that I was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality.\u201d In another place in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,those who deride the personal form of God are calledm\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101s, or asses. God certainly has a form, but His form is entirely different from ours. That is the real understanding ofnir\u0101k\u0101ra.\n\nAnd just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form is not like our material forms, so His pastimes are also not of this material nature. Anyone who knows this is immediately liberated. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.9),\n\njanma karma ca me divyameva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janmanaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\n\n\u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains my eternal abode.\u201d Simply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a purely, one can come to understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord and thus become liberated. Chanting is easy and sublime. One who offenselessly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will always remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, pastimes, qualities, and entourage, and that remembrance will liberate him from all sinful reactions and all material bondage.\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas here declare that although there are many methods prescribed in theVedasfor attaining liberation from sinful reactions, these methods are all insufficient, because they cannot elevate a person to the standard of absolute purity. Those who practice other methods of purification mentioned in theVedasgenerally desire some material benefit, such as elevation to the heavenly kingdom. But a devotee does not care for elevation to the heavenly planets. A devotee doesn\u2019t care a fig for any planet in this material world, because he knows that the benefit of entering into the heavenly kingdom is temporary. We may live for thousands of years on a higher planet and enjoy a very high standard of life, complete with beautiful wife, abundant wealth, and the finest wine, but there is no permanent benefit. For a devotee, such a life is hellish, because he does not wish to live without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is genuine spiritual realization.\n\nWe simply care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be happy. That is real happiness. We try to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ka\u1e41sa was also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, insofar as he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but his meditation was unfavorable. His meditation was on how to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He was thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he thought of Him as his enemy. That is certainly notbhakti,or devotion. Thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but being opposed to His desire, opposed to satisfying Him, is notbhakti. One must act favorably in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Arjuna was a devotee because he acted favorably, for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Materially speaking, Arjuna\u2019s actions appear unfavorable, but they were favorable as far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was concerned. Therefore they were perfect and free from all sin.\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s Transcendental Pastimes\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between activities ofbhaktiand ordinary pious activities. Cultivation of knowledge and pious activities is on the material platform. Piety does not amount to liberation. A pious man is situated on the platform of goodness, but he remains a conditioned soul, bound up by good reactions. One may even become abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,a very pious man, but that does not mean he has become a devotee. And sometimes a devotee appears to act against the rules of mundane piety. Arjuna, for example, was an exalted devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he killed his relatives. Ignorant people may say, \u201cArjuna is not a good man. Look, he killed his grandfather, his teacher, and his nephews, devastating the entire family.\u201d But in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.3)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Arjuna,bhakto \u2019si me:\u201cYou are My very dear friend.\u201d In the estimation of the material world Arjuna may not be a good man, but because he is a soul surrendered to the desire of the Supreme Lord, he must be accepted as a devotee. While it is true that Arjuna killed his own kinsmen, in the eyes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he remained a dear friend and devotee. That is the difference between a devotee and a good man of this world: A good man of this world tries to always act piously, for he knows that if he acts badly he will suffer sinful reactions; but a devotee, although naturally a very good man, can act like a bad man on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order and still not fall down: he remains a pure devotee and is very dear to the Lord.\n\nAs mentioned above, hearing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes is very purifying, but such hearing has to be done with the right attitude. Some persons with material vision are very much attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 \u2013His pastimes with His cowherd girlfriends \u2013 but they do not appreciate His fighting and killing the demons. They do not know that the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is good in any and all circumstances. Whether He is enjoying in the company of His devotees or killing the demons, He remains the Absolute Truth, and therefore all His pastimes are equally purifying to hear.\n\nGenerally people go to hear the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamfrom professional reciters, who are especially fond of describing ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101. The people think, \u201cOh, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is embracing a girl \u2013 this is very nice.\u201d At times ten thousand people will gather to hear ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101,and in this way the reciters earn a nice profit. Thus people come to think that the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatammeans the Tenth Canto, which contains ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101and other pastimes, but what they don\u2019t realize is that there are so many important instructions in the other cantos as well. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the summum bonum, is described in the Tenth Canto, and the other nine cantos are especially meant for purifying the heart so that one may understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nTherefore we instruct everyone first of all to read the first nine cantos of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamvery carefully. Then one may read the Tenth Canto with proper understanding. Those who hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101and take it as an ordinary story cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth. Ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101is not an affair of lust. It is a transcendental pastime of love between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the chapters of the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamdescribing ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101are not meant for ordinary persons; they are meant for liberated persons only. Therefore these descriptions of ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101should not be described to ordinary people. Those who are advanced devotees, liberated from material contamination, can try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101. One must not try to imagine ther\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in mundane terms.\n\nBut even though ordinary hearers of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamdo not know the deep significance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019sr\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101,because they hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes they become purified. And if they hear from authorized sources, they will be promoted to the transcendental devotional platform. The disease within the heart is lust, the desire to enjoy, and by hearing from authorized sources about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes of loving exchanges with thegop\u012bs,the deep-rooted lusty desires in the heart will be completely eradicated.\n\nUnfortunately, most people do not hear the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamfrom authoritative sources. They hear only from professional reciters. Therefore they remain materially diseased, full of lusty desires. Some becomesahajiy\u0101, pretending to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and Hergop\u012bfriends. In this way they behave as if they were the supreme enjoyer.\n\nThe pure devotee\u2019s business is to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as soon as he chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra,he remembers how to do so. In the material world, the living entities are inclined to go astray. The mind and senses generally become attracted to material objects of desire. But one should draw one\u2019s mind to the eternal by the practice ofbhakti-yoga. Otherwise, one\u2019s mind and senses will force one to performkarma,activities for personal sense gratification. And as soon as a person engages in sense gratification, he commits sin. Therefore to avoid karmic activities, which quickly entangle one in the process of repeated birth and death, one must take to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nHere the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas advise us in the same way: If we want to be freed from the reactions ofkarma, we should glorify the Supreme Lord twenty-four hours a day. That will purify us. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cInstead of taking to prescribed ritualistic ceremonies, simply engage your mind in describing or glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d This is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIn K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or devotional service, there are nine processes: hearing about the transcendental name, form, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord, chanting about these, remembering these, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering Him respectful worship, offering Him prayers, becoming His servant, considering Him one\u2019s friend, and surrendering everything to Him. One who practices one or more of these processes of devotional service throughout his life is sure to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. That is the art of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We cannot abandon all activities and simply chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore we keep ourselves constantly engaged in practical devotional service so that our mind is fixed upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then, at the time of death, we are sure to attain total liberation from material existence.\n\nOne who is not practiced in devotional service cannot all of a sudden chant the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death. He must have prior practice in order to chant effectively. Therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has recommended,k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25:\u201cOne should chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\u201d This is the best way of remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this age, and always remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ensures our return home, back to Godhead. As the Lord promises in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.8),\n\nabhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktenacetas\u0101 n\u0101nya-g\u0101min\u0101parama\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 divya\u1e41y\u0101ti p\u0101rth\u0101nucintayan\n\n\u201cHe who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, is sure to reach Me.\u201d\n\nThat Aj\u0101mila remembered K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not accidental. He had chanted the name of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a earlier in his life, but he forgot the Lord due to bad association. Nevertheless, the transcendental effect of his earlier practice was there at the time of his death, even though he was calling out the name of his youngest son, not intending to call for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nIndiscriminate Mercy\n\nAs stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.6):\n\nya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41tyajaty ante kalevaramta\u1e41 tam evaiti kaunteyasad\u0101 tad-bh\u0101va-bh\u0101vita\u1e25\n\n\u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d\n\nOne who practices chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is naturally expected to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when he meets with some accident. Even without such practice, however, if one somehow or other chants the holy name of the Lord when he meets with an accident and dies, he will be saved from hellish life after death. For example, if a person falls from a high rooftop but somehow or other cries out \u201cHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d that cry will be heard by the Lord. Or, if in our sleep we dream that a tiger is coming to eat us and we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in our sleep, the Lord hears that also.\n\nAlthough Aj\u0101mila indirectly chanted the holy name of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a through the medium of the name of his youngest son, he at once remembered Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Therefore in Vedic society children are given God\u2019s names. It is not that the child becomes God. If we name a child N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, it is understood that he is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a d\u0101sa, the servant of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Similarly, we give our disciples spiritual names, such as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u d\u0101sa, V\u0101mana d\u0101sa, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a d\u0101sa. That Aj\u0101mila remembered Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a by calling his son of the same name is confirmed in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which says that the power of the sound vibration of the holy name is absolute.\n\nOne attains freedom from all sinful reactions immediately upon recitation of the holy name, even if one does not understand the potency of the name. Whether one is chanting with devotion and reverence or without any faith, more sinful reactions are vanquished than a sinful man can commit. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name has such unlimited potency. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantrain Navadv\u012bpa, the people used to imitate the Lord and His associates. At that time the land was ruled by Mohammedans, and sometimes the people would go to one of the government officials and complain, \u201cThe Hindus are chanting \u2018Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u2019 dancing wildly, and thrashing their arms about.\u201d In this way they imitated thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanaof Lord Caitanya. In Western countries the onlookers also imitate our chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when we go out to chant on the street. Even by imitating, however, they become purified. The holy name is so powerful that if someone derides us, saying, \u201cWhy are you chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 it is nonsense!\u201d he also gets spiritual benefit.\n\nThe chanting of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name is like the sun rising in one\u2019s darkened heart. This universe is full of darkness, and only by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrangement for sunshine do we see light. As soon as the sun sets, the world comes under the influence of darkness. Likewise, our heart is full of the darkness of ignorance, but there is a light to dispel the darkness, and that light is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Due to impious activities we are in ignorance, but to those who constantly engage in the service of the Lord with love and affection, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reveals Himself in the heart. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s special mercy, the devotees are always kept in the light of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows everyone\u2019s intention or motive, and His mercy is especially meant for those who are sincerely engaged in His service.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone, and as such, His mercy is unlimited. However, He is very much inclined toward His devotees. If one is prepared to accept His mercy unlimitedly, then He is prepared to give it unlimitedly. On account of our envious nature, however, we are not prepared to take His mercy. In theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.66)K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja/ aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi:\u201cJust give up all other so-called religions and surrender to Me alone. I shall protect you from all sinful reactions.\u201d He openly offers His protection, but we do not take it. Sunlight is also equally distributed throughout the universe, but if we close the door and do not come out to take advantage of it, that is our own fault. Sunlight and moonlight do not discriminate, illuminating the houses ofbr\u0101hma\u1e47aswhile leavingca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las\u2019 [dogeaters\u2019] houses in darkness. No, the light is distributed indiscriminately. Similarly, the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equally available to everyone, but it is up to each individual to accept God\u2019s freely distributed mercy.\n\nNaturally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bestows more mercy upon His devotee, because the devotee has the capacity to accept that mercy through service. The process of receiving the causeless mercy of the Lord is to render more and more service. We should be very enthusiastic to render service to the Lord. That enthusiasm will come when we chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with faith and determination.\n\nSomeone may argue, \u201cI can see how chanting the holy name with faith is purifying, but if a man has no faith, then how will the holy name act?\u201d Here are some examples: If an innocent child touches fire, knowingly or unknowingly, it will burn him. Or, if we give medicine to a child, it acts, even though he does not know the potency of the medicine or how it is acting. Poison also acts in this way. Similarly, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra acts, even though we may not know how or why. Even ignorant lower creatures are benefited when we chant loudly. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura: \u201cWhen one chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loudly, every living entity, moving or nonmoving, benefits.\u201d (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Antya-l\u012bl\u01013.69)\n\nThe potency of the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is confirmed by the spread of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. In countries where the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is spreading, learned scholars and other thoughtful men are realizing its effectiveness. For example, Dr. J. Stillson Judah, a learned scholar, has been very much attracted to this movement because he has actually seen that it is turning hippies addicted to drugs into pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who voluntarily become servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and humanity. Even a few years ago, such hippies did not know the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but now they are chanting it and becoming pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nAnother analogy: fire will act, regardless of whether handled by an innocent child or by someone well aware of its power. If a field of dry grass is set afire, either by a man who knows the power of fire or by a child who does not, the grass will be burned to ashes. Similarly, a person may or may not know the power of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but if he chants the holy name, he will become free from all sinful reactions. This is the correct conclusion of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas.\n\nExtended Lease on Life\n\nThe servants of Yamar\u0101ja are so powerful that generally they cannot be hindered anywhere, but this time they were baffled and disappointed in their attempt to take away a man they considered sinful. Therefore they immediately returned to Yamar\u0101ja and described to him everything that had happened. They thought that it was unnatural that Aj\u0101mila, who had seemed eligible to be brought before Yamar\u0101ja, had been released by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas.\n\nNow Aj\u0101mila was fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. By the divine association of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, who were highly elevated Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, Aj\u0101mila came to his full consciousness. He had been arrested, but then he had been released, and now he was free from all fear. This is liberation. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by the association of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or devotees of the Lord, one becomes free from all fear. This position is eternal. Aj\u0101mila became fearless due to being reinstated in his constitutional position. At once he began to offer nice prayers to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas:v\u0101\u00f1ch\u0101-kalpatarubhya\u015b ca k\u1e5bp\u0101-sindhubhya eva ca:\u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto the devotees of the Lord, who are just like desire trees and oceans of mercy.\u201d This is the life of a devotee: he is always offering prayers to other devotees. First he offers respects to his spiritual master, next to his grand-spiritual master, next to his great-grand-spiritual master, and then to all devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nVai\u1e63\u1e47avas are also Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas because they carry out the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very eager for all the conditioned souls rotting in this material world to surrender to Him and be saved from material pangs in this life and punishment in hellish conditions after death. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava therefore tries to bring conditioned souls to their senses. Those who are fortunate like Aj\u0101mila are saved by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and thus they return home, back to Godhead.\n\nGood examples of merciful Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs. They scrutinizingly studied all kinds of scriptures to establish the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu(The Nectar of Devotion) \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b quotes many verses from different scriptures in support of the principles ofbhakti. Why did he and the other Gosv\u0101m\u012bs go to so much trouble and research? It is very laborious to research the Vedic literature in search of authoritative statements, and then to assimilate them in order to support the Vedic conclusions. But the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs took up that laborious work out of compassion for humanity.\n\nSpreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs did, is the best welfare work for all humanity. There seem to be many other welfare activities, but their benefit is only temporary. The great welfare work of spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, undertaken by exalted personalities such as the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, has real value for all men because it is based upon substantial spiritual truth. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are just like desire trees (kalpa-v\u1e5bk\u1e63a), for they can fulfill all one\u2019s spiritual desires. And thus they are also oceans of mercy (k\u1e5bp\u0101-sindhu).\n\nAj\u0101mila heard the conversation between the Yamad\u016btas and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, and simply by hearing he was completely cleansed of all material contamination. Such is the purifying effect of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who regularly hears the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta,theBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu,or any other Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava literature gets the same benefit as Aj\u0101mila and becomes free of all material contamination.\n\nAj\u0101mila was very grateful to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, and he immediately offered his respects by bowing down before them. Similarly, we have to make firm our relationships with the servants of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has said,gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25:\u201cOne should consider oneself the servant of the servant of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Without offering respects to the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, no one can approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nAfter Aj\u0101mila had offered his respects to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, he prepared to say something out of gratitude. But they immediately took their leave because they preferred that he glorify the Supreme Lord instead. Since all his sinful reactions had been vanquished, Aj\u0101mila was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord sincerely unless one is free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.28):\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tv anta-gata\u1e41 p\u0101pa\u1e41jan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101mte dvanda-moha-nirmukt\u0101bhajante m\u0101\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the duality of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas made Aj\u0101mila aware of devotional service so that He might soon become fit to return home, back to Godhead. To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mood of separation, glorification of the Lord is very intense."

        "chapter_title": "The Moment of Truth",
        "chapter_text": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: After hearing the discourses between the Yamad\u016btas and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, Aj\u0101mila could understand the religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature. These principles are mentioned in the three Vedas. He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, Aj\u0101mila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee. He could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.\n\nAj\u0101mila said, \u201cAlas, being a servant of my senses, how degraded I became! I fell down from my position as a duly qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a and begot children in the womb of a prostitute. Alas, all condemnation upon me! I acted so sinfully that I degraded my family tradition. Indeed, I gave up my chaste and beautiful young wife to have sexual intercourse with a fallen prostitute accustomed to drinking wine. All condemnation upon me! My father and mother were old and had no one to look after them. Because I did not take care of them, they lived with great difficulty. Alas, like an abominable lower-class man, I ungratefully left them in that condition.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that as a consequence of such activities, a sinful person like me must be thrown into hellish conditions meant for those who have broken religious principles and must there suffer extreme miseries.\n\n\u201cWas this a dream I saw, or was it reality? I saw fearsome men with ropes in their hands coming to arrest me and drag me away. Where have they gone? And where have those four liberated and very beautiful persons gone who released me from arrest and saved me from being dragged down to the hellish regions?\n\n\u201cI am certainly most abominable and unfortunate to have merged into the ocean of sinful activities. But nevertheless, because of my previous spiritual activities, I could see those four exalted personalities who came to rescue me. Now I feel exceedingly happy because of their visit.\n\n\u201cWere it not for my past devotional service, how could I, a most unclean keeper of a prostitute, have gotten an opportunity to chant the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a when I was just ready to die? Certainly it would not have been possible.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.2.24\u201333)\n\nRepentance\n\nHaving heard the conversation between the Yamad\u016btas and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, Aj\u0101mila became firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He began to lament, \u201cHow unfortunate I was to engage in so many sinful activities!\u201d This is the proper attitude for a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee. Whatever he may have done in the past, no matter how sinful, when he comes in contact with devotees and hears transcendental topics in relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (bh\u0101gavata-kath\u0101), he becomes purified and laments his previous condition. Indeed, the symptom of his purification is that he laments having behaved so sinfully. He repents and discontinues his past grievous conduct.\n\nAj\u0101mila was now at the stage of devotional service in which one is freed from all material impediments and is completely satisfied (ahaituky apratihat\u0101 yay\u0101tm\u0101 supras\u012bdati). Having reached this platform, Aj\u0101mila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness naturally endeavors to follow the rules of devotional service, and he regularly chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra:Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. A person should not suppose that because he has taken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he can continue his sinful activities and have their effects counteracted. We have repeatedly warned that this is the greatest offense against the holy name. Like Aj\u0101mila, one should repent, \u201cHow unfortunate I was to engage in so many sinful activities! But now, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I have come to know that I was acting improperly.\u201d\n\nThus Aj\u0101mila greatly repented, remembering all his sinful activities. He remembered that he had been trained by his father to be a first-classbr\u0101hma\u1e47a,that he had been educated in the science of theVedas,and that he had married a beautiful and chaste wife, a girl who was innocent and highly qualified, having come from a respectablebr\u0101hma\u1e47afamily. Aj\u0101mila now lamented, \u201cI rejected her and accepted a prostitute, an abominable drunkard!\u201d\n\nIt is a Vedic regulation that men of the higher classes \u2013br\u0101hma\u1e47as,k\u1e63atriyas,andvai\u015byas\u2013 do not beget children in the wombs of lower-class women. Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable. Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born in thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aclass, thek\u1e63atriyaclass, thevai\u015byaclass, or the\u015b\u016bdraclass, according to the three qualities of material nature. The horoscope must be examined because a marriage between a boy of thebr\u0101hma\u1e47aclass and a girl of the\u015b\u016bdraclass is incompatible; married life would be miserable for both husband and wife. Of course, this is a material calculation according to the three modes of nature, yet it is important for the peace and prosperity of the family and society. But if the boy and girl are devotees, there need be no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very happy combination.\n\nAj\u0101mila thought, \u201cBecause I failed to be self-controlled, I was degraded to an abominable life and all my brahminical qualifications were nullified.\u201d This is the mentality of one who is becoming a pure devotee. When one is elevated to the platform of devotional service by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master, one first regrets his past sinful activities. This helps one advance in spiritual life. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had given Aj\u0101mila the chance to become a pure devotee, and the first duty of a devotee is to regret his past sinful activities in illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. Not only should a devotee give up his past bad habits, but he must always regret his past sinful acts. This is the standard of pure devotion.\n\nDebts to Pay\n\nAj\u0101mila repented his negligence in performing his duty to his wife, father, and mother. It is the duty of grown-up children to render service to their aged parents. This practice should be reintroduced into present society. Otherwise, what is the use of family life? Proper family life means that the husband should be protective, the wife chaste, and the children grateful to their father and mother. Children should think, \u201cMy father and mother gave me so much service. When I was unable to walk, they carried me. When I was unable to eat, they fed me. They gave me an education. They gave me life.\u201d A bona fide son thinks of ways to render service to his father and mother. And just as a woman is expected to be faithful to her husband, so the husband should be grateful for her service and protect her. Because of his association with a prostitute, however, Aj\u0101mila had abandoned all his duties. Regretting this, he now considered himself quite fallen.\n\nAccording to the Vedic social system, as soon as one takes birth he becomes indebted to so many persons. We are indebted to the\u1e5b\u1e63is,or great sages, because we derive knowledge from their transcendental writings, such as the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, compiled by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva. The authors of the scripture know past, present, and future, and we are urged to take advantage of such invaluable knowledge. Thus we are indebted to the sages.\n\nWe are also indebted to the demigods, for they manage the affairs of the universe, supplying it with every essential-sunshine from the sun god, S\u016brya; moonshine from the moon god, Candra; air from V\u0101yu; and so on. Each element is controlled by a particular demigod.\n\nWe are also indebted to ordinary living entities from whom we take service. For example, we take milk from the cow. According to Vedic understanding, the cow is considered one of our mothers because we drink her milk, just as at birth we drink our mother\u2019s milk. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamlists seven mothers: our own mother, the wife of our teacher or spiritual master, the wife of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a, the wife of the king, the nurse, the cow, and the earth. We are indebted to all seven of these mothers, and also to our father, brothers, friends, relatives, and forefathers.\n\nAlso, if someone accepts charity, he becomes indebted, and that debt has to be repaid, just as borrowed money must be repaid. Therefore devotees should not accept charity from anyone unless they intend to spend it in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. For a devotee to accept donations just to satisfy his belly is a great sin.Br\u0101hma\u1e47asandsanny\u0101s\u012bswho accept charity from others must accept it with great caution. According to the Vedic social structure, only thebrahmac\u0101r\u012b, sanny\u0101s\u012b,andbr\u0101hma\u1e47aare allowed to collect money in charity. An ordinary householder must not. Thebrahmac\u0101r\u012bmay collect alms from the public for serving his spiritual master, and asanny\u0101s\u012bmay collect money for serving God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. TheVedaslikewise direct people to give charity to thebr\u0101hma\u1e47asbecause they know how to spend it for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Charity given to a worthy person is in the mode of goodness, charity given for one\u2019s own personal benefit is touched with the mode of passion, and charity given without any consideration is sunk in the mode of ignorance. For instance, if we give money to a rascal, he will likely take it to the nearest liquor shop. Those who are rich may think it does not matter \u2013 they can afford not to discriminate \u2013 but the scriptures describe these three kinds of charity.\n\nWe may well ask, How can one hope to liquidate all his debts? The answer is: only by taking shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Mukunda. The name Mukunda indicates one who liberates us from material contamination. We are indebted to the demigods, but we cannot take shelter of them. If we actually want shelter, we should take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He alone can free us from all debts. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if He excuses us, then all other departmental managers, such as the demigods, must also excuse us.\n\nAj\u0101mila understood his position as a debtor, but since he had now taken shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, all his debts were cleared. Simply by taking shelter of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is nondifferent from Mukunda, Aj\u0101mila became free. Similarly, if we want to be free from all sinful reactions, we have no alternative but to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends,m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cSimply surrender unto Me.\u201d We should follow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s advice. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to liquidate all our debts to so many persons, especially in this Age of Kali.\n\nPermanent Credit\n\nIn the material world there is danger at every step. Even for those who are pure devotees there is the danger of falling down from the standard of purity. However, in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.5.17)N\u0101rada Muni assures us,\n\ntyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harerbhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadiyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\n\nThe worddharmain this verse means \u201coccupational duties.\u201d Abr\u0101hma\u1e47a,for example, has certain occupational duties. Similarly, ak\u1e63atriyahas his, and so also do thevai\u015byaand\u015b\u016bdra. If a person gives up his occupational duties and takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, strictly following all the rules and regulations, but if due to his immature execution of devotional service he falls down, there is still no loss for him. Whatever he does as service to the Supreme Lord, although it may be a small percentage of his whole life, will remain to his credit. He does not lose it.\n\nOn the other hand, one who perfectly executes his occupational duties but fails to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ultimately gains nothing. Strictly discharging one\u2019s occupational duties means living a life of piety. But suppose through these pious activities you are promoted to the heavenly kingdom. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101that as soon as the effects of your pious activities are finished, you will be forced to return to this planet. Another point: If a person performs pious activities in this life, such as giving in charity, he must return here in the next life to accept the beneficial results of his pious actions. That means he must accept another term of material life. So it is not a sound idea to hope for acquisition of the effects of pious activities.\n\nUnfortunately, even in India people are more inclined to perform pious activities, such as giving in charity, than to take up devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They hope that by performing suchtapasya,or austerity, they will be elevated at death to a higher standard of material life in the heavenly planets. They also worship demigods for this purpose, or to gain a benediction in this life. Lord \u015aiva, for example, very quickly gives his worshiper material benedictions \u2013 whatever his devotee wants. He is very kind. He is known as \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a, \u201che who is easily satisfied.\u201d For this reason people are fond of worshiping him for material prosperity. But \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a condemns such worship in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.20):k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25.\u201cThose whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto the demigods.\u201d\n\nThe\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamtells the story of V\u1e5bk\u0101sura, who sought a terrible benediction from Lord \u015aiva. V\u1e5bk\u0101sura asked that whoever he would touch upon the head would be destroyed. This is the sort of benediction sought by demons. R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu also received such benedictions. They thought that by becoming powerful they could elude death. This is typical demoniac mentality.\n\nNone of these demons, however, was saved from death by the benediction received from the demigods. Rather, ultimately they were all killed by the Supreme Lord. It is nature\u2019s law that everyone here must die. No one who takes birth in the material world can live eternally. The material world is called Martyaloka, meaning that every living entity here is subject to birth, death, old age, and disease. In illusion, people do not see this. They try to adjust their material condition so that they can live perpetually. Modern scientists also aspire to be immortal, in imitation of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. This is all foolishness. One should not be afraid of dying, but one should be cautious and ask, \u201cWhat sort of situation will I attain in my next life as a result of my activities?\u201d\n\nA devotee is never afraid of death. He simply prays to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cI may die and take birth again repeatedly, as You like. But I only ask that, in whatever condition I may live, by Your mercy I will never forget You.\u201d A devotee is not afraid, but he is cautious not to fall down. At the same time, he knows that whatever percentage of devotional service he renders is to his permanent credit. The story of Aj\u0101mila is the perfect illustration of that point. We should follow the rules and regulations very strictly, but even if we fall down, there is no loss. That is the statement of N\u0101rada Muni quoted above. Even if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the basis of sentiment and executes devotional service for only some time and again returns to material life, whatever service he has rendered is recorded, and one day he will be saved, just as Aj\u0101mila was saved.\n\nAfter the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas disappeared, Aj\u0101mila at first wondered whether he had been dreaming that they had come to release him from the binding ropes of the Yamad\u016btas. When Aj\u0101mila was on his deathbed, practically in a coma, he actually saw the Yamad\u016btas and Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, but it seemed to him that he was just dreaming. When he saw that he was in fact released from the fearsome agents of Yamar\u0101ja, he wanted to see the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas again. They had appeared very splendid. Their bodily features were just like those of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and they were decorated like Him and carried the four symbols of His potency: the conchshell, lotus, club, and disc. Their bodies shone with a very beautiful luster, and their dress was of golden silk. Therefore Aj\u0101mila inquired, \u201cWhere are those beautiful personalities who released me from the bondage of the Yamad\u016btas?\u201d\n\nAj\u0101mila thought, \u201cMy whole life was full of sinful activities, so how could I be worthy of seeing such great personalities?\u201d He concluded, \u201cPerhaps in my previous life I did something good, and as a result I have been allowed to see the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas.\u201d In fact, early in life Aj\u0101mila had been a faithful servant of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and as a result he was able to see the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. It was the good association Aj\u0101mila had been blessed with in his early days that saved him. As stated in theCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta(Madhya22.54),\n\n\u2018s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga\u2019, \u2018s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga\u2019-sarva-\u015b\u0101stre kayalava-m\u0101tra s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ge sarva-siddhi haya\n\n\u201cThe verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment\u2019s association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.\u201d In the beginning of his life Aj\u0101mila was certainly very pure, and he associated with devotees andbr\u0101hma\u1e47as;because of that pious activity, even though he was fallen he was inspired to name his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(15.15),sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca:\u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge, and forgetfulness.\u201d The Lord is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave Aj\u0101mila the inspiration to name his youngest son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a so that in affection he would constantly call \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a! N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a!\u201d and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death. Such is the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja:by the mercy of the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one receives the seed ofbhakti,devotional service. Watering this seed by the process of hearing and chanting the name of the Lord saves a devotee from the greatest fear.\n\nIn our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee\u2019s name to one that reminds him of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a d\u0101sa or Govinda d\u0101sa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a somehow or other.\n\nRemembrance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death is generally possible only for persons who have established an intimate relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a throughout a lifetime of devotional service. When Aj\u0101mila was a young boy he was trained by his father to be completely faithful to the Lord, and until the age of twenty he served Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a very nicely. Although Aj\u0101mila had fallen down from the standard of devotional service to Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and forgotten his relationship with Him, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a did not forget, and in Aj\u0101mila\u2019s hour of need He reciprocated His devotee\u2019s love. Thus Aj\u0101mila was given the presence of mind to remember N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very appreciative of even a small amount of devotional service. He confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(2.40),\n\nneh\u0101bhikrama-n\u0101\u015bo \u2019stipratyav\u0101yo na vidyatesvalpam apy asya dharmasyatr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t\n\n\u201cIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path protects one from the most fearful type of danger.\u201d If a person practices even a small amount of devotional service, it can save him from the greatest danger. So why not take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness? Engage in devotional service always, twenty-four hours a day. Then there is no question of danger. One who has become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is fearless. He knows he is under the protection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "chapter_text": "Aj\u0101mila continued: \u201cI am a shameless cheater who has killed his brahminical culture. Indeed, I am sin personified. What am I in comparison to the all-auspicious chanting of the holy name of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a?\n\n\u201cI am such a sinful person, but since I have now gotten this opportunity, I must completely control my mind, life, and senses and always engage in devotional service so that I may not fall again into the deep darkness and ignorance of material life.\n\n\u201cBecause of identifying oneself with the body, one is subjected to desires for sense gratification, and thus one performs many kinds of pious and impious acts. This is what constitutes material bondage. Now I shall disentangle myself from my material bondage, which has been caused by the Supreme Lord\u2019s illusory energy in the form of a woman. Being a most fallen soul, I was victimized by the illusory energy and have become like a dancing dog led around by a woman\u2019s hand. Now I shall give up all lusty desires and free myself from this illusion. I shall become a merciful, well-wishing friend to all living entities and always absorb myself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\u201cSimply because I chanted the holy name of the Lord in the association of devotees, my heart is now becoming purified. Therefore I shall not fall victim again to the false lures of material sense gratification. Now that I have become fixed in the Absolute Truth, I shall no longer identify myself with the body. I shall give up the false conceptions of \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019 and fix my mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d\n\n\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: Because of a moment\u2019s association with devotees \u2013 the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas \u2013 Aj\u0101mila detached himself from the material conception of life with determination. Thus free from all material attraction, he immediately started for Hardwar. There he took shelter at a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temple, where he executed the process of bhakti-yoga. He controlled his senses and fully applied his mind in the service of the Lord. Thus Aj\u0101mila fully engaged in devotional service, and in this way he detached his mind from the process of sense gratification and became fully absorbed in thinking of the form of the Lord.\n\nWhen his intelligence and mind were fixed upon the form of the Lord, Aj\u0101mila once again saw before him four celestial persons. He could understand that they were those he had seen previously, and thus he offered them his obeisances by bowing down before them.\n\nUpon seeing the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, Aj\u0101mila gave up his material body at Hardwar on the bank of the Ganges. He regained his original, spiritual body \u2013 one appropriate for an associate of the Lord. Accompanied by the order-carriers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he then boarded an airplane made of gold. Passing through the airways, he went directly to the abode of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the husband of the goddess of fortune.\n\nBecause of bad association, Aj\u0101mila had given up all brahminical culture and religious principles. Becoming most fallen, he had stolen, drunk liquor, and performed other abominable acts. He had even kept a prostitute. Thus he had been destined to be carried away to hell by the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja. But he was immediately rescued simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nTherefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and glorifying the name, fame, form, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand. One cannot derive this benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge, or meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods a person will take to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.\n\nBecause this very confidential historical narration has the potency to vanquish all sinful reactions, a person who hears or describes it with faith and devotion is no longer doomed to hellish life, regardless of his having a material body and regardless of how sinful he may have been. Indeed, the Yamad\u016btas do not approach him even to see him. After giving up his body, he returns home, back to Godhead, where he is very respectfully received and worshiped.\n\nWhile suffering at the time of death, Aj\u0101mila chanted the holy name of the Lord, and although the chanting was directed toward his son, he nevertheless returned home, back to Godhead. Therefore if a person faithfully and inoffensively chants the holy name of the Lord, what doubt is there that he will return to Godhead? (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.2.34\u201349)\n\nDetermination\n\nThe holy name of God is all-auspicious. Therefore for one who constantly practices chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, there cannot be any inauspiciousness. Just by chanting, one is put into an auspicious condition of life perpetually.\n\nThose engaged in broadcasting the holy name through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should always consider what their position was before they came and what it is now. They had fallen into abominable lives as meat-eaters, drunkards, and woman-hunters, performing all kinds of sinful activities, but now they have been given the opportunity to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Therefore they should always appreciate this opportunity. By the grace of the Lord we are opening many branches, and the members of this movement should use this good fortune to chant the holy name of the Lord and serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. They must be conscious of the difference between their present conditions and their past conditions and should always be very careful not to fall from the most exalted life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Every devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should have this determination. Devotees have been elevated to an exalted position by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master, and if they remember that this is a great opportunity and pray to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that they will not fall again, their lives will be successful.\n\nBeing fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, Aj\u0101mila settled the debts he had accrued due to his sinful activities, and he was filled with determination to continue chanting the holy name of the Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a: \u201cIf I continue chanting the holy name of the Lord,\u201d he thought, \u201cI will always be engaged in the highest welfare activities for the benefit of all living entities, and I shall be very peaceful.\u201d Because he was now purified of all sinful reactions, Aj\u0101mila realized that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was dictating from within his heart that his duty was to become every living entity\u2019s well-wisher.\n\nEveryone\u2019s Friend\n\nThe devotees of the Lord are very kind. They preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the welfare of the general public, and thus they are friends to all living entities. Others cannot be the well-wishers of all. The politicians, for example, engage in so-called service of their countrymen, but they are not the true friends of everyone in the land, because although they may serve the interests of their fellow men, they do not look after the interests of the animals. In this way they discriminate. A devotee is a friend to every living entity, whether man, animal, insect, or plant. A devotee is not willing to kill even an ant, but a nondevotee will mercilessly send animals to the slaughterhouse and in the same breath declare himself the friend of everyone.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, God, is the best friend of every living entity. He is equal to everyone. He is not only the friend of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana \u2013 thegop\u012bs,His parents, the cowherd men and boys, the cows \u2013 but He is everyone\u2019s friend, because everyone is part and parcel of Him. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loves everyone unlimitedly. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees inherit the superexcellent loving qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore they are truly the friends of everyone.\n\nThekarm\u012bs,fruitive workers, perform sinful acts for their personal interest, killing innocent animals and becoming puffed up with their material opulence.J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs,those in search of liberation through knowledge of Brahman, are also interested only in themselves. Butbhaktas,or devotees, are interested in the well-being of everyone. A devotee is especially merciful to the fallen, conditioned souls. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is the personification ofbhakti,loving devotion to God, teaching all of us how to become devotees. He is therefore calledpatita-p\u0101vana,or the one who delivers the fallen, conditioned souls. Anyone following in His footsteps is alsopatita-p\u0101vana.Aj\u0101mila was now in this same mood, and thus he thought, \u201cNow I shall be able to become the friend of all living entities and become peaceful.\u201d\n\nThis should be the standard of determination for all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious persons. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should free himself from the clutches ofm\u0101y\u0101,and he should also be compassionate to all others suffering in those clutches. The activities of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are meant not only for oneself but for others also. This is the perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is interested only in his own salvation is not as advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as one who feels compassion for others and who therefore propagates K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such an advanced devotee will never fall down, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give him special protection. That is the sum and substance of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Everyone is like a plaything in the hands of the illusory energy and is acting as she dictates. One should come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to release oneself and others from this bondage.\n\nAssociation with Devotees\n\nThese verses lucidly explain how a living entity is victimized by his material conditioning. The beginning of illusion is to misidentify oneself as the body. Therefore theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101begins with the spiritual instruction that one is not the body but the spirit soul within the body. One can always remain conscious of this fact only if one remains pure by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amah\u0101-mantra,and staying in the association of devotees. This is the secret of success. Therefore we stress that one should chant the holy name of the Lord and keep oneself free from the contaminations of this material world, especially the contaminations of lusty desires for illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling. With determination one should vow to follow these principles and thus be saved from the miserable condition of material existence.\n\nThe first necessity is to become freed from the bodily conception of life. Aj\u0101mila was immediately freed from the illusory bodily conception of life by hearing the conversation between the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas and the Yamad\u016btas. The proof is that right after this incident he left his wife and children and went straight to Hardwar for further advancement in spiritual life. It is mentioned here that he took shelter in a temple of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and executed the process of devotional service. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has established temples all over the world for this very purpose. There is no need to travel to Hardwar. Anyone can take shelter of the temple nearest him, engage in the devotional service of the Lord, and thus achieve the highest success in life by becoming absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIf one worships the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the temple, one\u2019s mind will naturally be absorbed in thought of the Lord and His form. There is no distinction between the form of the Lord and the Lord Himself. Thereforebhakti-yogais the easiest system of yoga. Yogis try to concentrate their minds upon the form of the Supersoul, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, within the heart, but this same objective is easily achieved when one\u2019s mind is absorbed in thinking of the Deity in the temple. In every temple there is a transcendental form of the Lord, and one may easily think of this form. By seeing the Lord during the formal worship ceremony, or\u0101rati,by sacrificing one\u2019s money, time, and energy for the worship of the Deity, and by constantly thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class yog\u012b. This is the best process of yoga, as confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(6.47):\n\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41mad-gaten\u0101ntar-\u0101tman\u0101\u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41sa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25\n\n\u201cOf all yogis, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving serve to Me \u2013 he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d So the first-class yogi is he who controls his senses and detaches himself from material activities by always thinking of the form of the Lord.\n\nBack to Godhead\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas who had rescued Aj\u0101mila came before him again when his mind was firmly fixed upon the form of the Lord. They had gone away for some time to give Aj\u0101mila a chance to become firmly fixed in meditation upon the Lord. Now that his devotion had matured, they returned to take him back to Godhead. Understanding that the same Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had returned, Aj\u0101mila offered them his obeisances by bowing down before them.\n\nAj\u0101mila was now ready to return home, back to Godhead, and thus he gave up his material body and regained his original, spiritual body. As the Lord says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(4.9):\n\njanma karma ca me divyameva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janmanaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\n\n\u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d The result of perfection in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that after giving up one\u2019s material body, one is immediately transferred to the spiritual world in one\u2019s original, spiritual body to become an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Some devotees go to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha to become associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and others go to Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to become associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nSpiritual airplanes from the spiritual planets, like the one that came for Aj\u0101mila, can take one back home, back to Godhead, in a second. The speed of such a spiritual airplane can only be imagined. Spirit is finer than the mind, and everyone has experience of how swiftly the mind travels from one place to another. Therefore one can imagine the swiftness of the spiritual form by comparing it to the speed of the mind. In less than even a moment, a perfect devotee can return home, back to Godhead, immediately after giving up his material body.\n\nSuch perfection is not available to anyone but devotees of the Lord. It has been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, manykarm\u012bs,j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs,and yogis become attached to material activities again. Many so-calledsv\u0101m\u012bsand yogis give up material activities as false (jagan mithy\u0101), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselvessanny\u0101s\u012bs,members of the renounced order. All these activities are illusory aspects of the material world.\n\nIf one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25:chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young boys and girls who had been addicted to drugs and who had other bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as they joined the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in the modes of passion and ignorance. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.2.19) confirms this:\n\ntad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca yeceta etair an\u0101viddha\u1e41sthita\u1e41 sattve pras\u012bdati\n\nAs a result of acting under the modes of passion and ignorance, one becomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the process of chanting and hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one comes to the platform of goodness and becomes happy. As he advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015b chidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces.\n\nAt the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are disordered. At that time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name. While the body is fit, therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If a person does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be able to properly chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt."

        "chapter_text": "King Par\u012bk\u1e63it said, \u201cO my lord, O \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Yamar\u0101ja is the controller of all living entities in terms of their religious and irreligious activities, but his order had been foiled. When his servants, the Yamad\u016btas, informed him of their defeat by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, what did he reply?\n\n\u201cO great sage, never before has it been heard anywhere that an order from Yamar\u0101ja has been baffled. Therefore I think that people will have doubts about this that no one but you can eradicate. Since that is my firm conviction, kindly explain the reasons for these events.\u201d\n\n\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b replied: My dear king, when the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja were baffled and defeated by the order-carriers of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, they approached their master, the controller of Sa\u1e41yaman\u012b-pur\u012b and master of sinful persons, to tell him of this incident.\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas said, \u201cOur dear lord, how many controllers are there in this material world? How many causes are responsible for manifesting the various results of activities performed under the three modes of material nature?\n\n\u201cIf in this universe there are many judges who disagree about punishment and reward, their contradictory actions will neutralize one another, and no one will be punished or rewarded. Otherwise, if their contradictory acts fail to neutralize one another, everyone will have to be both punished and rewarded. Since there are many different karm\u012bs, or fruitive workers, there may be different judges to give them justice, but just as one central emperor controls different departmental rulers, there must be one supreme controller to guide all the judges.\n\n\u201cThe supreme judge must be one, not many. It was our understanding that you are that supreme judge and that you have jurisdiction even over the demigods. Our impression was that you are the master of all living entities, the supreme authority who discriminates between the pious and impious activities of all human beings.\n\n\u201cBut now we see that the punishment ordained under your authority is no longer effective, since your order has been transgressed by four wonderful and perfect persons. We were bringing the most sinful Aj\u0101mila toward the hellish planets, following your order, when those beautiful persons from Siddhaloka forcibly cut the knots of the ropes with which we were arresting him. As soon as the sinful Aj\u0101mila uttered the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, these four beautiful men immediately arrived and reassured him, saying, \u2018Do not fear. Do not fear.\u2019 We wish to know about them from your lordship. If you think we are able to understand them, kindly describe who they are.\u201d\n\n\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: Thus having been questioned, Lord Yamar\u0101ja was very pleased with his order-carriers because of hearing from them the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He remembered the lotus feet of the Lord and began to reply. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.3.1\u201311)\n\nWho\u2019s in Charge?\n\nMah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it became astonished and asked \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cHow is it possible for anyone to surpass the order of Yamar\u0101ja?\u201d Nobody can supersede a warrant issued by the police magistrate. Similarly, Yamar\u0101ja is the chief of the universal \u201cpolice,\u201d and he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yamar\u0101ja\u2019s business is to arrest all the criminal living entities and subject them to punishment in his region, Yamaloka. Sinful persons are taken there and put into various hellish conditions. The case of Aj\u0101mila, however, is exceptional. The Yamad\u016btas were ordered to arrest him and bring him to the court of Yamar\u0101ja, but the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas released him from their grasp.\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas\u2019 interference with the Yamad\u016btas was apparently unlawful, but just as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can do anything, His messengers can likewise nullify any order in the material world. That is the power of the Supreme Lord. In the material world no one has the authority or power to check the orders of Yamar\u0101ja, but the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas acted under the higher authority of the Supreme Lord.\n\nWhen the Yamad\u016btas returned to Yamaloka, they immediately went to Yamar\u0101ja and asked, \u201cHow is it that we were checked from carrying out our duty? My dear lord, how many controllers are there? Are you the only controller, or are there many other controllers?\u201d Less intelligent men think that a particular demigod, such as Indra, S\u016brya, or Candra, is supreme. This is like thinking the policeman on the street is all-powerful within the state. There are so many police constables controlling the crowd in the street, but only foolish persons do not understand that above the constables are many higher officers, all the way up to the police commissioner, the governor of the state, and the president. The Yamad\u016btas simply carried out the orders of Yamar\u0101ja, thinking him to be the supreme controller, and this was the first incident in which they were stopped from executing his orders.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that the Yamad\u016btas were so disappointed that it was almost with anger that they asked Yamar\u0101ja whether there were many masters other than him. Furthermore, because the Yamad\u016btas had been defeated and their master could not protect them, they were inclined to say that there was no need to serve such a master. If a servant cannot carry out the orders of his master without being defeated, what is the use of serving such a powerless master?\n\nBecause the Yamad\u016btas had been stopped, they doubted whether Yamar\u0101ja actually had the power to punish the sinful. Although they had gone to arrest Aj\u0101mila, following Yamar\u0101ja\u2019s order, they found themselves unsuccessful because of the order of some higher authority. Therefore they were unsure of whether there were many authorities or only one. If there were many authorities who gave different judgments, which could be contradictory, a person might be wrongly punished or wrongly rewarded, or he might be neither punished nor rewarded. According to our experience in the material world, a person punished in one court may appeal to another. Thus the same man may be either punished or rewarded according to different judgments. However, in the law of nature or the court of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there cannot be such contradictory judgments. The judges and their judgments must be perfect and free from contradictions.\n\nActually, the position of Yamar\u0101ja was very awkward in the case of Aj\u0101mila because according to everything they had been taught by Yamar\u0101ja, the Yamad\u016btas were right in attempting to arrest Aj\u0101mila, but the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had baffled them. Although Yamar\u0101ja, under these circumstances, was accused by both the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas and the Yamad\u016btas, he is perfect in administering justice because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he will explain what his real position is and how everyone is controlled by the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.\n\nIn this world there must be measures for controlling the living entities.\u015a\u0101stra,or scripture, is meant for controlling civilized men. From this word comes the word\u015bi\u1e63ya, meaning disciple, or one who voluntarily accepts the control or guidance of the spiritual master. Those who are not gentle must be controlled byastra, or weapons. The police force needs guns and clubs to control the thieves and rogues of society.\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas inquired from their master whether there are different departments of justice for different types of men. In the material world a person is contaminated by some combination of the three qualities of nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance \u2013 and he conducts his activities accordingly. Symptoms of one chiefly under the influence of the mode of ignorance are laziness, excessive sleeping, and uncleanliness. The main symptom of one chiefly under the influence of the mode of passion is a strong desire to exploit material nature and other living entities for one\u2019s own sense enjoyment. And the chief symptom of one under the influence of the mode of goodness is knowing things as they are. To such a person, everything is revealed in its proper way.\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas suggested, \u201cThere may be many controllers of people in the different modes of nature, but who is the chief controller, and how are his actions carried out? As far as we know, you are the controller of everyone.\u201d In governmental management there may be departmental officials to give justice to different persons, but the law must be one, and that central law must control everyone. The Yamad\u016btas could not imagine that two judges would give two different verdicts in the same case, and therefore they wanted to know who the supreme judge is. The Yamad\u016btas were certain that Aj\u0101mila was a most sinful man, but although Yamar\u0101ja wanted to punish him, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas excused him. This was a puzzling situation that the Yamad\u016btas wanted Yamar\u0101ja to clarify. The Yamad\u016btas had thought that Yamar\u0101ja was the only person in charge of administering justice. They were fully confident that no one could counteract his judgments, but now, to their surprise, his order had been violated by the four wonderful persons from Siddhaloka. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura suggests that the Yamad\u016btas may have said to Yamar\u0101ja, \u201cWe think that your absolute power of controlling is finished, because four very wonderful personalities checked us from executing our duty, which you gave us.\u201d\n\nVi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b also remarks that the Yamad\u016btas may have wanted to bring the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas before Yamar\u0101ja. If Yamar\u0101ja could then have punished the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, the Yamad\u016btas would have been satisfied. Otherwise, they desired to commit suicide. Before pursuing either course, however, they wanted to know about the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas from Yamar\u0101ja, who is also omniscient.\n\nSubmissive Inquiry\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas said, \u201cWe wish to learn from you what are the actual facts regarding this incident. If you think that we shall be able to understand, please enlighten us.\u201d This is the way of inquiring submissively from superiors. Not challenging. We shall always find that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, Arjuna, and anyone else executing this process of spiritual enlightenment inquires with humble submission and a mood of service. Merely because we put a question to our superior does not mean that he is obliged to answer us. Sometimes he may refuse if we are not able to comprehend the answer. We cannot demand. Inquiry, submission, and service are the way to knowledge. Whenever Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it questioned \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, he said very submissively, \u201cIf you think that I shall be able to understand, please answer this question.\u201d\n\nBefore Yamar\u0101ja replied to the Yamad\u016btas, he first remembered the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as the subordinate puts the question to his superior with a submissive attitude, similarly, the superior is not proud, boasting, \u201cYes, I can answer your question!\u201d He remembers the lotus feet of the Lord and prays, \u201cWhatever You help me to speak, I\u2019ll answer.\u201d As long as the teacher is not proud and the disciple is not disobedient, puffed up, or impudent, they can exchange spiritual questions and answers. One should not inquire in a challenging mood, and the one who answers should remember the lotus feet of the Lord so that the right answer will be given.\n\nYamar\u0101ja was very pleased with his servants because they had chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in his dominion. Yamar\u0101ja has to deal with men who are all sinful and who can hardly understand N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Consequently, when his order-carriers uttered the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he was extremely pleased, for he is also a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava."

        "chapter_text": "Yamar\u0101ja said, \u201cMy dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and \u015aiva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance, and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth.\n\n\u201cJust as the driver of a bullock cart ties ropes through the nostrils of his bulls to control them, the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all men with the ropes of His words in the Vedas, which set forth the names and activities of the distinct orders of human society (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, and \u015b\u016bdra). In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.\n\n\u201cI, Yamar\u0101ja; Indra, the King of heaven; Nir\u1e5bti; Varu\u1e47a, the god of the waters; Candra, the moon god; Agni, the fire god; Lord \u015aiva; Pavana, the god of the air; Lord Brahm\u0101; S\u016brya, the sun god; Vi\u015bv\u0101su; the eight Vasus; the S\u0101dhyas; the Maruts; the Rudras; the Siddhas; and Mar\u012bci and the other great \u1e5b\u1e63is engaged in maintaining the departmental affairs of the universe, as well as the best of the demigods headed by B\u1e5bhaspati and the great sages headed by Bh\u1e5bgu, are all certainly freed from the influence of the two base material modes of nature, namely passion and ignorance. Nevertheless, although we are in the mode of goodness, we cannot understand the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What, then, is to be said of others, who under illusion merely speculate to know God?\n\n\u201cAs the different limbs of the body cannot see the eyes, so the living entities cannot see the Supreme Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart. Not by the senses, by the mind, by the life air, by thoughts within the heart, or by the vibration of words can the living entities ascertain the real situation of the Supreme Lord.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.3.12\u201316)\n\nOne Supreme Controller\n\nThe Yamad\u016btas suspected that there was a ruler even above Yamar\u0101ja. To eradicate their doubts, Yamar\u0101ja immediately replied, \u201cYes, there is one supreme controller above everything.\u201d Yamar\u0101ja is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also move, are not under his control. Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamar\u0101ja. Therefore although Yamar\u0101ja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities. There are other demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25:the supreme controller is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Others, who control their own departments in the affairs of the universe, are insignificant in comparison to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme controller. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(7.7),matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya:\u201cMy dear Dhana\u00f1jaya [Arjuna], no one is superior to Me.\u201d Therefore Yamar\u0101ja immediately cleared away the doubts of his assistants, the Yamad\u016btas, by confirming that there is a supreme controller above all others.\n\nIn this material world, everyone is controlled by the laws of nature, regardless of who he is. Whether one is a human being, a demigod, an animal, a tree, or a plant, one is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.10):may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram.\u201cThe material nature is working under My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings.\u201d Thus the natural machine works under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s control.\n\nUnder the Control of Var\u1e47a and \u0100\u015brama\n\nApart from other living entities, a living being in the human form of body is meant to be controlled by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the divisions ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015brama,the social and spiritual classes. Otherwise he cannot escape punishment by Yamar\u0101ja. The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of abr\u0101hma\u1e47a, the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This is the perfection of life. Thebr\u0101hma\u1e47as,k\u1e63atriyas,vai\u015byas,and\u015b\u016bdrascan elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to their activities (sve sve karma\u1e47y abhirata\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 labhate nara\u1e25). The divisions ofvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramaare necessary to insure the proper execution of duties and peaceful existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to worship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam). If one thus follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one\u2019s ability, his life will be perfect. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(1.2.13)confirms this:\n\nata\u1e25 pumbhir dvija-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dhavar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasyasa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am\n\n\u201cO best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging one\u2019s prescribed duties (dharma) according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the Personality of Godhead.\u201d Thevar\u1e47\u0101\u015bramainstitution offers the perfect process for making one eligible to return home, back to Godhead, because the aim of everyvar\u1e47aand\u0101\u015bramais to please the Lord. One can please the Lord under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, and then one\u2019s life is perfect. The Supreme Lord is worshipable, and everyone worships Him directly or indirectly. Those who worship Him directly get the results of liberation quickly, whereas the liberation of those who serve Him indirectly is delayed.\n\nThe wordsn\u0101mabhir v\u0101ciin verse 13 (n\u0101mabhih \u2013by different names;v\u0101ci \u2013to the Vedic language) are very important. In thevar\u1e47\u0101\u015bramainstitution, there are different names \u2013br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha,andsanny\u0101s\u012b. Thev\u0101k, or Vedic injunctions, give directions for all these divisions. Everyone is expected to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord and perform duties as indicated in theVedas.\n\nControlled by Three Modes of Nature\n\nMen and other living entities within this cosmic manifestation are controlled by the three modes of nature. For the living entities controlled by the base qualities of nature \u2013 passion and ignorance \u2013 there is no possibility of understanding God. Even those in the mode of goodness, like the many demigods and great\u1e5b\u1e63isdescribed in these verses, cannot understand the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,only one who is situated in devotional service to the Lord, and who is thus transcendental to all material qualities, can understand Him (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti.)\n\nOrdinary philosophers can never know the Lord. The great devotee Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva confirms this in the following statement to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam1.9.16):\n\nna hy asya karhicid r\u0101janpum\u0101n veda vidhitsitamyad-vijij\u00f1\u0101say\u0101 yukt\u0101muhyanti kavayo \u2019pi hi\n\n\u201cO king, no one can know the plan of the Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.\u201d No one, therefore, can understand God by speculative knowledge. Indeed, by speculation one will be bewildered.\n\nDirected by the Supersoul\n\nAlthough the different parts of the body do not have the power to see the eyes, the eyes direct the movements of the body\u2019s different parts. The legs move forward because the eyes see what is in front of them, and the hand touches because the eyes see touchable entities. Similarly, every living being acts according to the direction of the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart. The Lord Himself confirms this in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(15.15):sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca.\u201cI am sitting in everyone\u2019s heart and giving directions for remembrance, knowledge, and forgetfulness.\u201d Elsewhere in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.61)it is stated,\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be \u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati:\u201cThe Supreme Lord, as the Supersoul, is situated in the heart.\u201d The living entity cannot do anything without the sanction of the Supersoul. The Supersoul is acting at every moment, but the living entity cannot understand the form and activities of the Supersoul by manipulating his senses. The example of the eyes and the bodily limbs is very appropriate. If the limbs could see, they could walk forward without the help of the eyes; but that is impossible. Although one cannot see the Supersoul in one\u2019s heart through sensual activities, His direction is necessary."

        "chapter_text": "Yamar\u0101ja continued: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient and fully independent. He is the master of everyone and everything, including the illusory energy. He has His form, qualities, and features, and similarly His order-carriers, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are very beautiful, possess bodily features and transcendental qualities almost like His. They always wander within this world with full independence.\n\n\u201cThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas are worshiped even by the demigods and are very rarely seen. They protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands of enemies, from envious persons, and even from my jurisdiction, as well as from natural disturbances.\n\n\u201cThe real religious principle is enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although fully situated in the mode of goodness, even the great \u1e5b\u1e63is who occupy the topmost planets cannot ascertain this principle, nor can the demigods or the leaders of Siddhaloka, to say nothing of the demons, ordinary human beings, Vidy\u0101dharas, or C\u0101ra\u1e47as.\n\n\u201cLord Brahm\u0101, Bhagav\u0101n N\u0101rada, Lord \u015aiva, the four Kum\u0101ras, Lord Kapila [the son of Devah\u016bti], Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Janaka Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and I myself know the real religious principle. My dear servants, this transcendental religious principle, which is known as bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or surrender unto the Supreme Lord and love for Him, is uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. It is very confidential and difficult for ordinary human beings to understand, but if by chance one fortunately understands it, he is immediately liberated, and thus he returns home, back to Godhead.\n\n\u201cDevotional service, beginning with the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is the ultimate religious principle for the living entity in human society.\n\n\u201cMy dear servants, who are as good as my sons, just see how glorious is the chanting of the holy name of the Lord! The greatly sinful Aj\u0101mila chanted only to call his son, not knowing that he was chanting the Lord\u2019s holy name. Nevertheless, by chanting the holy name of the Lord he remembered N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and thus he was immediately saved from the ropes of death.\n\n\u201cTherefore it should be understood that one is easily relieved from all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name of the Lord and chanting His qualities and activities. This is the only process recommended for relief from sinful reactions. Even if a person chants the holy name of the Lord with improper pronunciation, he will achieve relief from material bondage if he chants without offenses. Aj\u0101mila, for example, was extremely sinful, but while dying he merely chanted the holy name, and although calling his son, he achieved complete liberation because he remembered the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\n\u201cBecause they are bewildered by the Supreme Lord\u2019s illusory energy, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, Jaimini, and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the confidential religious system of the twelve mah\u0101janas. They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing devotional service or chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas \u2013 especially the Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda, and \u1e5ag Veda \u2013 their intelligence has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement; instead, they are interested in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation.\n\n\u201cConsidering all these points, therefore, intelligent men decide to solve all problems by adopting the devotional service of chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart and who is a mine of all auspicious qualities. Such persons are not within my jurisdiction for punishment. Generally they never commit sinful activities, but even if by mistake or because of bewilderment or illusion they sometimes commit sinful acts, they are protected from sinful reactions because they always chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra.\n\n\u201cMy dear servants, please do not approach such devotees, for they have fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are equal to everyone, and their narrations are sung by the demigods and the inhabitants of Siddhaloka. Please do not even go near them. They are always protected by the club of the Supreme Lord, and therefore Lord Brahm\u0101 and I and even the time factor are not competent to chastise them.\n\n\u201cParamaha\u1e41sas are exalted persons who have no taste for material enjoyment and who drink the honey of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. My dear servants, bring to me for punishment only persons who are averse to the taste of that honey, who do not associate with paramaha\u1e41sas, and who are attached to family life and worldly enjoyment, which form the path to hell.\n\n\u201cMy dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to chant the holy name and qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even once, and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Send me those who do not perform their duties toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which are the only duties in human life. Please bring me all such fools and rascals.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.3.17\u201329)\n\nThe Protectors\n\nYamar\u0101ja was describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, but the order-carriers of Yamar\u0101ja were very eager to know about the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, who had defeated them in their encounter with Aj\u0101mila. Yamar\u0101ja therefore stated that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas resemble the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their bodily features, transcendental qualities, and nature. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, are almost as qualified as the Supreme Lord. Yamar\u0101ja informed the Yamad\u016btas that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas are no less powerful than Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Since Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is above Yamar\u0101ja, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas are above the Yamad\u016btas. Persons protected by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, therefore, cannot be touched by the Yamad\u016btas.\n\nYamar\u0101ja has described the qualities of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas to convince his own servants not to be envious of them. Yamar\u0101ja warned the Yamad\u016btas that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas are worshiped with respectful obeisances by the demigods and are always very alert to protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands of enemies, from natural disturbances, and from all dangerous conditions in this material world. Sometimes the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society are afraid of the impending danger of world war and ask what would happen to them if a war should occur. In all kinds of danger they should be confident of their protection by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself confirms in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(9.31):kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati. \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d\n\nMaterial danger is not meant for devotees. This is also confirmed in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(10.14.58):pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101\u1e41 na te\u1e63\u0101m.In this material world there are dangers at every step, but they are not meant for devotees who have fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord. The pure devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u may rest assured that the Lord will protect them, and as long as they are in this material world they should fully engage in devotional service by preaching the message of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely, chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the other aspects of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nDirect Connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\n\nWhen challenged by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas to describe the principles of religion, the Yamad\u016btas had said,veda-pra\u1e47ihito dharma\u1e25:\u201cThe Vedic literature defines religious principles.\u201d They did not know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental but are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world. Real religious principles arenistraigu\u1e47ya, above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental. The Yamad\u016btas did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting Aj\u0101mila, they were surprised.\n\nMaterialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are described in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(2.42), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,veda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha n\u0101nyad ast\u012bti v\u0101dina\u1e25:\u201cThe supposed followers of theVedassay that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies.\u201d Indeed, there is a group of men in India who are very fond of the Vedic rituals, not understanding the meaning of these rituals, which are intended to elevate one gradually to the transcendental platform of knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their faith to the Vedic rituals are calledveda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25.\n\nHerein it is stated that the real religious principle is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that principle in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.66):sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja.\u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\u201d That is the real religious principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows the Vedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the demigods in the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental religious principle must be understood from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly or from His special representative, as stated in these verses.\n\nIn theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a refers tobh\u0101gavata-dharmaas the most confidential religious principle (sarva-guhyatamam, guhy\u0101d guhyataram). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Arjuna, \u201cBecause you are My very dear friend, I am explaining to you the most confidential religion.\u201dSarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja:\u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\u201d One may ask, If this principle is very rarely understood, what is the use of it? In answer, Yamar\u0101ja states herein that this religious principle is understandable if one follows theparampar\u0101system of Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the four Kum\u0101ras, and the other standard authorities. There are four lines of disciplic succession: one from Lord Brahm\u0101, one from Lord \u015aiva, one from Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, and one from the Kum\u0101ras. The disciplic succession from Lord Brahm\u0101 is called the Brahma-samprad\u0101ya, the succession from Lord \u015aiva (\u015aambhu) is called the Rudra-samprad\u0101ya, the one from the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, is called the \u015ar\u012b-samprad\u0101ya, and the one from the Kum\u0101ras is called the Kum\u0101ra-samprad\u0101ya. One must take shelter of one of these foursamprad\u0101yasin order to understand the most confidential religious system. In thePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47ait is said,samprad\u0101ya-vih\u012bn\u0101 ye mantras te ni\u1e63phal\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25:if one does not follow the four recognized disciplic successions, his mantra, or initiation, is useless.\n\nAt present there are manyapasamprad\u0101yas, or un-bona fidesamprad\u0101yas,which have no link to authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the Kum\u0101ras, or Lak\u1e63m\u012b. People are misguided by suchsamprad\u0101yas. The\u015b\u0101strassay that being initiated into such asamprad\u0101yais a waste of time, for it will never enable one to understand real religious principles and surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nReal religious principles arebh\u0101gavata-dharma, the principles described in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamitself or in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the preliminary study of theBh\u0101gavatam. What are these principles? TheBh\u0101gavatam(1.1.2)says,dharma\u1e25 projjhita-kaitavo \u2019tra:\u201cIn the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamthere are no cheating religious systems.\u201d In other words, everything in theBh\u0101gavatamis directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. TheBh\u0101gavatam(1.2.6)further says,sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje:\u201cThe supreme religion is that which teaches its followers how to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of experimental knowledge.\u201d Such a religious system begins withtan-n\u0101ma-graha\u1e47a,chanting the holy name of the Lord. After chanting the holy name and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually sees the transcendental form of the Lord, the qualities of the Lord, and the pastimes of the Lord. In this way one fully understands the situation of the Personality of Godhead.\n\nOne can come to this understanding of the Lord, however, only by executing devotional service. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(18.55),bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25:\u201cOne can understand Me as I am only by devotional service.\u201d If a person is fortunate enough to understand the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is that after giving up his material body he no longer has to take birth in this material world (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti). Instead, he returns home, back to Godhead. That is the ultimate perfection. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in theBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101(8.15):\n\nm\u0101m upetya punar janmadu\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatamn\u0101pnuvanti mah\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\u201cAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\u201d\n\nEvidence in Support of Chanting the Holy Name\n\nThere is no need to conduct research into the significance of the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. The history of Aj\u0101mila is sufficient proof of the power of the Lord\u2019s holy name and the exalted position of a person who chants the holy name incessantly. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advised,\n\nharer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\n\n\u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d (B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a3.8.126) In this age, almost no one can perform all the difficult ritualistic ceremonies for becoming liberated. Therefore all the\u015b\u0101strasand all the\u0101c\u0101ryashave recommended that in this age one simply chant the holy name. That will bring one all perfection.\n\nIn the assembly of Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s father, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura confirmed that simply by chanting the Lord\u2019s holy name a person is liberated, even if he does not chant completely inoffensively.Sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47asand M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs do not believe that one can achieve liberation in this way, but the truth of Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s statement is supported by many quotations from the Vedic literature.\n\nIn the passage of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamunder discussion, for example, Yamar\u0101ja says, \u201cIt should be understood that one is easily relieved from all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name of the Lord and chanting His qualities and activities. This is the only process recommended for relief from sinful reactions.\u201dIn his commentary on this verse, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b gives the following quotation:s\u0101ya\u1e41 pr\u0101tar g\u1e5b\u1e47an bhakty\u0101 du\u1e25kha-gr\u0101m\u0101d vimucyate.\u201cIf one continually chants the holy name of the Lord with great devotion morning and evening, one will become free from all material miseries.\u201d Another quotation confirms that a person can achieve liberation if he hears the holy name of the Lord continually, every day, with great respect:anudinam idam \u0101dare\u1e47a \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van. Another quotation says,\n\n\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 dhy\u0101na\u1e41harer adbhuta-karma\u1e47a\u1e25janma-karma-gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 catad-arthe \u2019khila-ce\u1e63\u1e6ditam\n\n\u201cOne should always chant and hear about the wonderful activities of the Lord, one should meditate upon these activities, and one should endeavor to please the Lord.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam11.3.27) \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b also gives the following quote from thePur\u0101\u1e47as:p\u0101pa-k\u1e63aya\u015b ca bhavati smarat\u0101\u1e41 tam ahar-ni\u015bam.\u201cOne can become free from all sinful reactions simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord day and night.\u201d Finally, he quotes from the chapter of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamunder discussion (6.3.31):\n\ntasm\u0101t sa\u1e45k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47orjagan-ma\u1e45galam a\u1e41has\u0101mmahat\u0101m api kauravyaviddhy aik\u0101ntika-ni\u1e63k\u1e5btam\n\n\u201cThe chanting of the holy name of the Lord is able to uproot even the reactions of the greatest sins. Therefore the chanting of thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanamovement is the most auspicious activity in the entire universe.\u201d\n\nAll these quotations prove that one who constantly engages in chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, along with descriptions of His fame, form, and activities, is liberated. As stated wonderfully in verse 24,et\u0101vat\u0101lam agha-nirhara\u1e47\u0101ya pu\u1e41s\u0101m:simply by uttering the name of the Lord, one is freed from all sinful reactions.\n\nThe wordalamin this verse indicates that simply uttering the holy name of the Lord is sufficient. There is no need of any other process. Even if a person chants imperfectly, he becomes free from all sinful reactions.\n\nThe liberation of Aj\u0101mila proves this power of chanting the holy name. When Aj\u0101mila chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he did not precisely remember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his own son. At the time of death, Aj\u0101mila certainly was not very clean; indeed, he was famous as a great sinner. Furthermore, one\u2019s physiological condition is completely disturbed at the time of death, and in such an awkward condition it would certainly have been very difficult for Aj\u0101mila to have chanted clearly. Nevertheless, Aj\u0101mila achieved liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Therefore, what is to be said of those who are not sinful like Aj\u0101mila? It is to be concluded that with a strong vow one should chant the holy name of the Lord \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 for thus by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one will certainly be delivered from the clutches ofm\u0101y\u0101.\n\nThe chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is recommended even for persons who commit offenses, because if they continue chanting they will gradually chant offenselessly. Then, by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without offenses, one increases his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated by Lord Caitanya,prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n:one\u2019s main concern should be to increase one\u2019s attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to increase one\u2019s love for Him.\n\nSince one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. Yamar\u0101ja answers this question in the passage of\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamunder discussion. Unfortunately, unintelligent people are bewildered by the grandeur of Vedicyaj\u00f1as,and thus they want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. In 1975, when we established a large K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma temple in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies performed bybr\u0101hma\u1e47asbecause the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, especially thesm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47as,would not accept Europeans and Americans as bona fidebr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Thus we had to engagebr\u0101hma\u1e47asto perform costlyyaj\u00f1as. As theseyaj\u00f1aswere being performed, the members of our Society performedsa\u1e45k\u012brtanaloudly withm\u1e5bda\u1e45gas,and I considered thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanamore important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. The ceremonies and thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanawere going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (ja\u1e0d\u012b-k\u1e5bta-matir madhu-pu\u1e63pit\u0101y\u0101m), whereas thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanawas meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We would simply have performedsa\u1e45k\u012brtana, but then the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana would not have taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery words of theVedas,which describe sacrifices intended to elevate one to the higher planets.\n\nEspecially in this age,sa\u1e45k\u012brtanaalone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the different parts of the world simply continuesa\u1e45k\u012brtanabefore the Deity, especially before \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that althoughsa\u1e45k\u012brtanais sufficient for the perfection of life, worship of the Deity in the temple must continue so that the devotees may stay clean and pure. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore recommended that one follow both processes simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship andsa\u1e45k\u012brtanaalong parallel lines. This we should continue.\n\nThe Jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja\n\nIn this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes the following verse from the prayers of Lord Brahm\u0101 (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam10.14.29):\n\nath\u0101p\u012b te deva pad\u0101mbuja-dvaya-pras\u0101da-le\u015b\u0101nug\u1e5bh\u012bta eva hij\u0101n\u0101ti tattva\u1e41 bhagavan-mahimnona c\u0101nya eko \u2019pi cira\u1e41 vicinvan\n\nThe purport is that even though one is a very learned scholar of the Vedic\u015b\u0101stras,he may be completely unaware of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His name, fame, qualities, and so forth, whereas one who is not a great scholar can understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he somehow or other becomes a pure devotee of the Lord by engaging in devotional service. Therefore in verse 26 Yamar\u0101ja says,eva\u1e41 vim\u1e5b\u015bya sudhiyo bhagavati:those who engage in the loving service of the Lord becomesudhiya\u1e25,intelligent, but this is not so of a Vedic scholar who does not understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame, and qualities. A pure devotee is one whose intelligence is clear; he is truly thoughtful, because he engages in the service of the Lord \u2013 not as a matter of show but with love, with his mind, words, and body. Nondevotees may make a show of religion, but it is not very effective, because although they ostentatiously attend a temple or church, they are thinking of something else. Such persons are neglecting their religious duty and are punishable by Yamar\u0101ja. But a devotee who commits sinful acts unwillingly or accidentally, because of his former habits, is excused. That is the value of thesa\u1e45k\u012brtanamovement.\n\nIn effect, Yamar\u0101ja warned his servants, \u201cMy dear servants, henceforward you must stop disturbing the devotees. The devotees who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord and who constantly chant His holy name are praised by the demigods and the residents of Siddhaloka. Those devotees are so respectable and exalted that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u personally protects them with the club in His hand. If you approach such devotees, He will kill you with that club. What to speak of you, if even Lord Brahm\u0101 or I were to punish them, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u would punish us. Therefore do not disturb the devotees any further.\u201d\n\nAfter warning the Yamad\u016btas in this way, Yamar\u0101ja then indicates who is to be brought before him. He specifically advises the Yamad\u016btas to bring to him materialistic persons attached to household life merely for sex. As stated in the\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(7.9.45),yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham:people are attached to household life only for sex pleasure, which is very insignificant. They are always harassed in many ways by their material engagements for making money to maintain their families, and their only happiness is that after working very hard all day, at night they sleep and indulge in sex. Yamar\u0101ja specifically advises his servants to bring these persons to him for punishment and not to bring the devotees, who always lick the honey from the lotus feet of the Lord, who are equal to everyone, and who try to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness out of sympathy for all living entities. Devotees are not liable to be punished by Yamar\u0101ja, but persons who have no information of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment. The\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam(2.1.4) says,\n\ndeh\u0101patya-kalatr\u0101di\u1e63v\u0101tma-sainye\u1e63v asatsv apite\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 pramatto nidhana\u1e41pa\u015byann api na pa\u015byati\n\nMaterialistic persons complacently believe that their nations, communities, or families can protect them, unaware that all such fallible soldiers will be destroyed in due course of time.\n\nIn conclusion, one should try to associate with persons who engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day. Then one can come to know the purpose of human life, which is to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharmais also meant for that purpose. As stated in theVi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a(3.8.9):\n\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ravat\u0101puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101nvi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate panth\u0101n\u0101nyat tat-to\u1e63a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am\n\nHuman society is meant to follow strictly thevar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, which divides society into four social divisions (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya,and\u015b\u016bdra) and four spiritual divisions (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha,andsanny\u0101sa).Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharmaeasily brings one nearer to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the only true objective in human society.Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um:unfortunately, however, people do not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.Dur\u0101\u015bay\u0101 ye bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25:instead, they are simply bewildered by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s external, illusory energy. Every human being is expected to perform duties meant for approaching Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore Yamar\u0101ja advises the Yamad\u016btas to bring him only those persons who have forgotten their duties toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One who does not chant the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who does not bow down to the Deity of the Lord, and who does not remember His lotus feet is punishable by Yamar\u0101ja. In summary, allavai\u1e63\u1e47avas, persons unconcerned with Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are punishable by Yamar\u0101ja."

        "chapter_text": "[Then Yamar\u0101ja, considering himself and his servants offenders, spoke as follows, begging pardon from the Lord:] \u201cO my Lord, my servants have surely committed a great offense by arresting a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava such as Aj\u0101mila. O N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, O supreme and oldest person, please forgive us. Because of our ignorance, we failed to recognize Aj\u0101mila as a servant of Your Lordship, and thus we have certainly committed a great offense. Therefore with folded hands we beg Your pardon. My Lord, since You are supremely merciful and are always full of good qualities, please pardon us. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.\u201d\n\n\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: My dear king, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is able to uproot even the reactions of the greatest sins. Therefore the chanting of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement is the most auspicious activity in the entire universe. Please try to understand this so that others will take it seriously.\n\nOne who constantly hears and chants the holy name of the Lord and hears and chants about His activities can very easily attain the platform of pure devotional service, which can cleanse the dirt from one\u2019s heart. One cannot achieve such purification merely by observing vows and performing Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.\n\nDevotees who always lick the honey from the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a do not care at all for material activities, which are performed under the three modes of nature and which bring only misery. Indeed, devotees never give up the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to return to material activities. Others, however, who are addicted to Vedic rituals because they have neglected the service of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet and are enchanted by lusty desires, sometimes perform acts of atonement. Nevertheless, being incompletely purified, they return to sinful activities again and again.\n\nAfter hearing from the mouth of their master about the extraordinary glories of the Lord and His name, fame, and attributes, the Yamad\u016btas were struck with wonder. Since then, as soon as they see a devotee, they fear him and dare not look at him again.\n\nWhen the great sage Agastya was residing in the Malaya Hills and worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I approached him, and he explained to me this confidential history. (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam6.3.30\u201335)\n\nYamar\u0101ja Prays for Pardon\n\nLord Yamar\u0101ja took upon himself the responsibility for the offense committed by his servants. If the servant of an establishment makes a mistake, the establishment takes responsibility for it. Although Yamar\u0101ja is above offenses, his servants, practically with his permission, went to arrest Aj\u0101mila, which was a great offense. Theny\u0101ya-\u015b\u0101straconfirms,bh\u1e5bty\u0101par\u0101dhe sv\u0101m\u012bno da\u1e47\u1e0dah:\u201cIf a servant makes an offense, the master is punishable.\u201d Taking this seriously, Yamar\u0101ja, along with his servants, prayed with folded hands to be excused by the Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nAchieving Perfection\n\nWe should note that although Aj\u0101mila chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a imperfectly, he was delivered from all sinful reactions. The chanting of the holy name is so auspicious that it can free everyone from the reactions of sinful activities. However, as we have mentioned several times before, no one should conclude that he may continue to sin with the intention of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to neutralize the reactions. Rather, one should be very careful to remain free from all sins and never think of counteracting sinful activities by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, for this is another offense. If by chance a devotee accidentally performs some sinful activity, the Lord will excuse him, but one should not intentionally perform sinful acts.\n\nOne may very easily practice chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and thus become ecstatic in spiritual life. ThePadma Pur\u0101\u1e47astates,\n\nn\u0101m\u0101par\u0101dha-yukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41n\u0101m\u0101ny eva haranty aghamavi\u015br\u0101nti-prayukt\u0101nit\u0101ny ev\u0101rtha-kar\u0101\u1e47i ca\n\nEven if one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra offensively, one can nullify these offenses by continuously chanting without deviation. One who becomes accustomed to this practice will always remain in a pure transcendental position, untouchable by sinful reactions.\n\nA devotee\u2019s duty is to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. One may sometimes chant with offenses and sometimes without offenses, but if one seriously adopts this process, he will achieve perfection, which cannot be achieved through Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement. Persons who are attached to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies but do not believe in devotional service, who advise atonement but do not appreciate the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name, fail to achieve the highest perfection. Devotees, therefore, being completely detached from material enjoyment, never give up K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Those who are attached to Vedic ritualistic ceremonies because of lusty desires are subjected to the tribulations of material existence again and again.\n\nSince this incident, the Yamad\u016btas have given up the dangerous behavior of approaching devotees. For the Yamad\u016btas, a devotee is dangerous."
